      "Sills was a top soprano before heading New York City Opera from 1979-89, then chairing the Met board from 2002-05 and overseeing Gelb's hiring.",

I think it\u2019s Bellini\u2019s best work,\u201d Oropesa said. \u201cI find `Puritani\u2019 is one of the exceptions to the bel canto generalization of: it\u2019s boring, it\u2019s slow, it\u2019s all about the singers, the text is terrible, the stories are stupid.\u201d",

But she certainly has our attention now.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "The U.S. has taken the unprecedented step of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups say would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.",
      "The change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What's no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what's called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won't result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.",
      "States, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "The change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "\u201cThis decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is \u201cfar more reasonable\u201d and \u201cfinally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.\u201d",
      "Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.",
      "Medical experts said Monday's changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.",
      "\u201cAbandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\u201d said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just copy and paste public health and that\u2019s what they seem to be doing here,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. \u201cLiterally children's health and children's lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "Most high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.",
      "France today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.",

      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.",
      "O'Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is \u201cpretty tone deaf\u201d for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.",
      "Even a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.",
      "The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.",
      "The officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn\u2019t specify who was consulted.",
      "Scientists at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency\u2019s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.",
      "\u201cChanges of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.\u201d",
      "The move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.",
      "In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee \u2014 later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.",
      "Kennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",

      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",

      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers.

      "Pope Leo XIV has closed the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year, denouncing consumerism and anti-foreigner sentiment",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday closed out the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year by denouncing today's consumerist and anti-foreigner sentiment, capping a Jubilee that saw some 33 million pilgrims flock to Rome and a historic transition from one American pontiff to another.",
      "With cardinals and diplomats looking on, Leo kneeled down in prayer on the stone floor at the threshold of the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. He then stood up and pulled the two doors shut, symbolically concluding the rarest of Jubilees: one that was opened by a feeble Pope Francis in December 2024, continued during his funeral and the conclave, and then was closed by Francis' successor a year later.",
      "Only once before, in 1700, has a Holy Year been opened by one pope and closed by another.",
      "Tuesday's ceremony, at the start of Mass celebrating the feast of Epiphany, capped a dizzying year of special audiences, Masses and meetings that dominated Leo\u2019s first months as pontiff and in many ways put his own agenda on hold.",
      "As if to signal his pontificate now can begin in earnest, Leo has summoned the world\u2019s cardinals to the Vatican for two days of meetings starting Wednesday to discuss governing the 1.4-billion strong Catholic Church. On the agenda is the issue of the liturgy, suggesting Leo is diving head-first into the divisions within the church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass.",
      "In his homily Tuesday, Leo said the Jubilee year had invited all Christians to reflect on the Biblical teachings to welcome the stranger and resist \u201cthe flattery and seduction of those in power.\u201d",
      "\u201cAround us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us ask ourselves: has the Jubilee taught us to flee from this type of efficiency that reduces everything to a product and human beings to consumers? After this year, will we be better able to recognize a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbor in the foreigner, and fellow travelers in those who are different?\u201d",
      "He echoed the theme in a special Epiphany prayer delivered from the basilica loggia to a rain-soaked piazza below. As thousands of people huddled under colorful umbrellas and ponchos, Leo recalled that traditionally Jubilees have included appeals for peace and \u201ca redistribution of the land and its resources\u201d to those in need.",
      "\u201cIn the place of inequality, may there be fairness, and may the industry of war be replaced by the craft of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "For the Vatican, a Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receive indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins if they pass through the Holy Door.",
      "For Rome, it\u2019s a chance to take advantage of public funds, in this case some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion), to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards.",

      "Rome\u2019s relationship with Jubilees dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII inaugurated the first Holy Year in what historians say marked the definitive designation of Rome as the center of Christianity. Even then, the number of pilgrims was so significant that Dante referred to them in his \u201cInferno.\u201d",
      "Massive public works projects have long accompanied Holy Years, including the creation of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the big Vatican garage (for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II).",
      "Some works have been controversial, such as the construction of Via della Conciliazione, the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter\u2019s Square. An entire neighborhood was razed to make it for the 1950 Jubilee.",
      "The main public works project for the 2025 Jubilee was an extension of that boulevard: A pedestrian piazza along the Tiber linking Via della Conciliazione to the nearby Castel St. Angelo, with the major road that had separated them diverted to an underground tunnel.",
      "Leo has already announced that the next Jubilee will be in 2033, to commemorate what Christians believe was the A.D. 33 death and resurrection of Christ.",

      "\u201cWhat the opposition did in the 2024 election was to unite with a desire to transform the situation in Venezuela through democratic means, and that is embodied by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and, obviously, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia,\u201d he said. \u201cTo disregard that is to belittle, almost to humiliate, Venezuelans.\u201d",

      "As Iran is gripped by new protests, many people there are focused on the U.S. raid in Venezuela and wonder whether the same could occur in Tehran",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran faces a new round of protests challenging the country's theocracy, but it seems like the only thing people there want to talk about is half a world away: Venezuela.",
      "Since the U.S. military seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend, Iranian state media headlines and officials have condemned the operation. In the streets and even in some official conversations, however, there's a growing question over whether a similar mission could target the Islamic Republic's top officials including the supreme leader, 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The paranoia feeds into wider worries among Iranians. Many fear that close U.S. ally Israel will target Iran again as it did during the 12-day war it launched against Tehran in June. Israel killed a slew of top military officials and nuclear scientists, and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. Khamenei is believed to have gone into hiding for his protection.",
      "\u201cGod bless our leader, we should be careful too,\" said Saeed Seyyedi, a 57-year-old teacher in Tehran, worried the U.S. could act as it did in Venezuela.",
      "\"The U.S. has always been after plots against Iran, especially when issues like oil, Israel are part of the case. In addition, it can be complicated when it is mixed with the Russia-Ukraine war, the Lebanese (group) Hezbollah and drug accusations.\u201d",
      "The U.S. long has accused the Iranian-backed Hezbollah of running drug-smuggling operations to fund its operations, including in Latin America, which the group denies.",
      "Immediately after Maduro\u2019s seizure, an analyst on Iranian state television claimed, without offering evidence, that the U.S. and Israel had plans during the war last year to kidnap Iranian officials with a team of dual-national Iranians. Even for conspiracy-minded Iranian television, airing such a claim is unusual.",
      "Then on Sunday night, the prominent Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Javedan warned an audience at prayers in Tehran University that Khamenei's life was in danger.",
      "\u201cSomeone said he had a bad dream that the leader\u2019s life is in danger,\" Javedan said, without elaborating. \"Please pray.\u201d",
      "However, Iran is roughly twice the size of Venezuela and has what analysts consider to be a much stronger military and robust security forces. The memory of Operation Eagle Claw, a failed U.S. special forces mission to rescue hostages held after the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran, also haunts Washington.",

      "Uganda is preparing for a election in an atmosphere of political violence",
      "WAKISO, Uganda -- The Ugandan presidential candidate known as Bobi Wine wears a flak jacket and helmet while campaigning to protect himself from gunfire. But the safety gear offers no protection from the stinging clouds of tear gas that often follow him on the campaign trail.",
      "Wine is challenging President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986 by repeatedly rewriting the rules to stay in power. Term and age limits have been scrapped, rivals jailed or sidelined, and state security forces are a constant presence at opposition rallies as Museveni seeks a seventh term in elections on Jan. 15.",
      "Wine, a musician-turned-politician whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, faced similar setbacks in 2021, when he first ran for president. He was often roughed up by the police, clothes ripped from his body, and dozens of his supporters were jailed.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, he charged that this time \u201cthe military has largely taken over the election\u201d and that at least three of his supporters have been killed in violent campaign events.",
      "\u201cIt has been very violent. There\u2019s been a lot of impunity to the extent that we are denied the right to use the public roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hounded by security and followed by over 40 police and military cars. Everywhere I go to campaign, (the) day before, the military comes, beats up people, intimidates them, warns them against attending the rallies I address.\u201d",
      "The human rights group Amnesty International says the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings and other acts of violence amount to \u201ca brutal campaign of repression\u201d ahead of the vote.",
      "In a New Year's Eve address, the president said he recommended that the security forces use more tear gas to break up crowds of what he called \u201cthe criminal opposition.\"",
      "\u201cUsing tear gas for rioters is both legal and non-lethal,\u201d Museveni said in a televised speech. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t kill. It is much better than using live bullets.\u201d",
      "Security forces, notably the military, have repeatedly broken up Wine's campaign rallies, sending his supporters scampering into ditches and swamps.",
      "Critics note that Museveni, in contrast, campaigns without disruption and can go wherever he wants. Some charge that the election is simply a ritual to keep Museveni in power, not a fair exercise that could possibly lead to a change of government in the east African nation of 45 million.",
      "Wine, the most prominent of seven opposition candidates, has urged supporters to show courage before the security forces, although he has not called outright for protests. He said he wants his supporters to cast \u201cprotest votes\u201d in large numbers against Museveni's party on election day.",
      "In his interview with the AP, Wine cited at least three deaths at his rallies, including a man shot by the military and another run over by a military truck. The offenses can go unpunished because the electoral authorities, the police and the army \u201cserve the sitting government,\u201d he said. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said he was not aware of the alleged incidents.",
      "Museveni is the third-longest-serving leader in Africa. Now he seeks to extend his rule into a fifth decade.",
      "He first took power by force as the leader of a guerrilla army that said it wanted to restore democracy after a period of civil war and the cruel dictatorship of Idi Amin.",
      "Decades ago, Museveni criticized African leaders who overstayed their time in power. Years later, Ugandan lawmakers did the same thing for him when they jettisoned the last constitutional obstacle \u2014 age limits \u2014 for a possible life presidency.",
      "His son, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has asserted his wish to succeed his father, raising fears of hereditary rule as Museveni has no recognizable successor in the upper ranks of the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement.",

      "Museveni has been elected six times, nearly all of those polls marred by violence and allegations of vote rigging. He has since fallen out with many of the comrades who fought alongside him, including some who say he betrayed the ideals of their bush-war struggle. One of them is Kizza Besigye, once Museveni\u2019s personal doctor, who has been jailed for over a year and repeatedly denied bail after facing treason charges.",
      "Besigye was Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition leader before the rise of Wine, 43, who presents a different challenge for Museveni as the face of youthful hope for change. Wine has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.",
      "In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as a serious challenger for power.",
      "Yet Museveni dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and questions his patriotism. \u201cMr. Kyagulanyi and his evil foreigners that back him fail to understand that Uganda is a land of spiritual and political martyrs,\u201d Museveni said in his New Year\u2019s Eve address.",
      "Sarah Bireete, a government critic who runs the non-governmental group Center for Constitutional Governance, was arrested last week and criminally charged over allegations she unlawfully shared data related to the national voters' registry. The charges are yet to be substantiated.",
      "A magistrate remanded her to jail until Jan. 21, a decision that drew condemnation from some civic leaders as politically motivated because it silenced Bireete's work as a commentator ahead of voting.",
      "Before her arrest, Bireete had told the AP that Museveni\u2019s Uganda was \u201ca military dictatorship,\" not a democracy.",
      "\u201cThe evidence is out for everyone to see that indeed Uganda can no longer claim to be a constitutional democracy,\u201d she said.",
      "Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence from colonial rule six decades ago. That raises the stakes as an aging Museveni increasingly depends on a security apparatus helmed by his son, Gen. Kainerugaba.",
      "Kainerugaba has warned force could be used against Wine, including threatening to behead him in one of several tweets widely condemned as reckless a year ago.",
      "Museveni \"can\u2019t credibly claim to oppose repressive tactics that his own administration has employed for years,\u201d said Gerald Bareebe, a Ugandan who is an associate professor of politics at Canada's York University, speaking of Museveni's advice to the security forces.",
      "Bareebe pointed out that some within Museveni's party think the security forces have gone too far. Even they \u201care outraged by the brutal tactics employed by the police and military against innocent civilians,\u201d he said.",

      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and U.S. President Donald Trump wants to make sure his country controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.",

      "Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle.

      "Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region\u2019s mineral resources.",

      "Protesters angry over Iran's ailing economy have conducted a sit-in at Tehran's Grand Bazaar",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Protesters angry over Iran's ailing economy conducted a sit-in Tuesday at Tehran's Grand Bazaar, witnesses said, with security forces ultimately firing tear gas and dispersing demonstrators as the rest of the market shut down.",
      "The protest at the Grand Bazaar, the beating heart for centuries of both Iran's economic and political life, represents the latest signal that the demonstrations likely are to continue as the country's rial currency fell to a record low Tuesday. Already, violence surrounding the protests has killed at least 35 people with authorities detaining more than 1,200 others, activists abroad say.",
      "Meanwhile, the situation is likely to worsen as Iran's Central Bank drastically reduced the subsidized exchange rates for dollars it offers to importers and producers in the country. That likely will see merchants pass on price hikes in the coming days for goods directly onto consumers, whose life savings already have dwindled over years of international sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, while ordering a government investigation into one incident involving the protests, otherwise signaled Tuesday the crisis may be rapidly moving beyond the control of officials.",
      "\u201cWe should not expect the government to handle all of this alone,\" Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. \"The government simply does not have that capacity.\u201d",
      "In the Grand Bazaar, a labyrinth-like warren of covered passages and alleyways, demonstrators sat down in one passage in front of security forces as other shops nearby shut down on Tuesday, online videos showed and witnesses said. Other demonstrations similarly have seen people sit down in front of police after a photo circulated earlier of a man seen sitting alone in front of security forces.",
      "Authorities later fired tear gas to disperse the protesters. Iranian state-run media did not immediately acknowledge the incident, which has been common in the days since the demonstrations began on Dec. 28.",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "On Tuesday, $1 traded at 1.46 million rials, a new low, with no signs of slowing. Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials.",
      "More pain may be coming for Iranian consumers. Iran\u2019s Central Bank in recent days greatly reduced a preferential, subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate. Iran\u2019s government offer that rate to importers and producers to try to ensure the flow of food, medicine and other essential goods despite international sanctions over its nuclear program and other issues.",
      "However, many of those firms took advantage of the difference in rates, pocketing ever-greater profits as normal Iranians watched their savings rapidly lose value against the dollar. That's led to the Central Bank drastically reducing that rate.",
      "The currency and rate depreciation has directly impacted what's available in stores \u2014 and at what price. The average bottle of cooking oil just doubled in price, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Many have complained about shelves being empty in stores, likely as suppliers and merchants fear selling cooking oil at a loss. Cheese and chicken prices also spiked, while imported rice hasn't been available in some shops.",
      "Pezeshkian in his speech blamed inflation, sanctions and other woes for causing the depreciation \u2014 and warned tougher times may be coming.",

      "News organizations got a rare \u201cthank you\u201d from the Trump administration for not putting its military action in Venezuela in jeopardy by reporting on it before it happened",
      "In the wake of last weekend's U.S. military action in Venezuela, the news media got something it has seldom heard from the Trump administration: a \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited news organizations that had learned in advance about Saturday's strike that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with not putting the mission in jeopardy by publicly reporting on it before it happened.",
      "Rubio's acknowledgment was particularly noteworthy because Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cited a mistrust of journalists' ability to responsibly handle sensitive information as one of the chief reasons for imposing restrictive new press rules on Pentagon reporters. Most mainstream news organizations have left posts in the Pentagon rather than agree to Hegseth's policy.",
      "Speaking on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Rubio said the Republican administration withheld information about the mission from Congress ahead of time because \u201cit will leak. It's as simple as that.\u201d But the primary reason was operational security, he said.",
      "\u201cFrankly, a number of media outlets had gotten leaks that this was coming and held it for that very reason,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd we thank them for doing that or lives could have been lost. American lives.\u201d",
      "Semafor, citing \u201cpeople familiar with communications between the administration and news organizations,\u201d reported that The New York Times and The Washington Post had both learned of the raid in advance but held off reporting on it to avoid endangering U.S. military personnel. Representatives for both outlets declined to comment to The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Withholding information on a planned mission for that reason is routine for news organizations, said Dana Priest, a longtime national security reporter at the Post who now teaches at the University of Maryland. Even after the fact, the Post has asked government authorities about whether revealing certain details could endanger people, she said.",
      "When The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included in a text chain last spring where Hegseth revealed information about a military attack in Yemen, the journalist did not report on the events until well after U.S. personnel was out of danger and the information had been thoroughly checked out.",
      "Most Americans learned of the Venezuela attack in the predawn hours of Saturday when President Donald Trump announced it on his Truth Social platform upon completion.",
      "While The Associated Press did not have advance word that the operation would happen, its journalists in Venezuela heard and observed explosions taking place there, and that was reported on the news wire more than two hours before Trump's announcement. The U.S. involvement was not made clear until Trump's post, however.",
      "Hegseth, in defending rules that restrict reporters' movements and reporting in the Pentagon, told Fox News last year that \u201cwe have expectations that you're not soliciting classified or sensitive information.\u201d The Times last month filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the rules.",

      "Decisions on whether to report information that could put lives or a mission in danger often involve high-level discussions between editors and government officials. But Priest stressed that in a country with freedom of the press, the ultimate decision on whether to report the information lies with the news organization.",
      "Generations ago, President John F. Kennedy persuaded editors at the Times not to report when it learned in advance of a U.S.-backed attack by Cuban exiles on Fidel Castro\u2019s forces at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. The mission proved a monumental failure, and a Times editor, Bill Keller, later said that Kennedy expressed regret that the newspaper had not reported on what it had known because it could have prevented a fiasco.",
      "Many mainstream journalists covering the military and national security have extensive experience dealing with sensitive issues, Priest said. But there's a difference, she said, between reporting information that could put someone in danger and that which could prove embarrassing to an administration.",
      "\u201cThe reporters are not going to be deterred by a ridiculously broad censorship edict by the Trump administration,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey're going to dig in and work even harder. Their mission is not to curry favor with the Trump administration. It's to report information to the public.\u201d",

With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment. Around the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.",
      "The charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.",
      "\u201cShe's an ideologue, but a practical one,\u201d said Lee McClenny, a retired foreign service officer who was the top U.S. diplomat in Caracas during the period of Rodr\u00edguez's outreach. \"She knew that Venezuela needed to find a way to resuscitate a moribund oil economy and seemed willing to work with the Trump administration to do that.\"",
      "Nearly a decade later, as Venezuela\u2019s interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message \u2014 that Venezuela is open for business \u2014 seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \u201cgracious\u201d American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \u201ctotal access\u201d to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.",
      "This account of Rodr\u00edguez's political rise is drawn from interviews with 10 former U.S. and Venezuelan officials as well as businessmen from both countries who've had extensive dealings with Rodr\u00edguez and in some cases have known her since childhood. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from someone who they almost universally described as bookishly smart, sometimes charming but above all a cutthroat operator who doesn't tolerate dissent. Rodr\u00edguez didn't respond to AP requests for an interview.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez entered the leftist movement started by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez late \u2014 and on the coattails of her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, who as head of the National Assembly swore her in as interim president Monday.",
      "Tragedy during their childhood fed a hardened leftist outlook that would stick with the siblings throughout their lives. In 1976 \u2014 when, amid the Cold War, U.S. oil companies, American political spin doctors and Pentagon advisers exerted great influence in Venezuela \u2014 a little-known urban guerrilla group kidnapped a Midwestern businessman. Rodriguez's father, a socialist leader, was picked up for questioning and died in custody.",
      "McClenny remembers Rodr\u00edguez bringing up the murder in their meetings and bitterly blaming the U.S. for being left fatherless at the age of 7. The crime would radicalize another leftist of the era: Maduro.",
      "Years later, while Jorge Rodr\u00edguez was a top electoral official under Ch\u00e1vez, he secured for his sister a position in the president's office.",
      "But she advanced slowly at first and clashed with colleagues who viewed her as a haughty know-it-all.",
      "In 2006, on a whirlwind international tour, Ch\u00e1vez booted her from the presidential plane and ordered her to fly home from Moscow on her own, according to two former officials who were on the trip. Ch\u00e1vez was upset because the delegation\u2019s schedule of meetings had fallen apart and that triggered a feud with Rodriguez, who was responsible for the agenda.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to watch how Ch\u00e1vez talked about her,\u201d said one of the former officials. \u201cHe would never say a bad thing about women but the whole flight home he kept saying she was conceited, arrogant, incompetent.\u201d",
      "Days later, she was fired and never occupied another high-profile role with Ch\u00e1vez.",

      "Years later, in 2013, Maduro revived Rodr\u00edguez's career after Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer and he took over.",
      "A lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez speaks English and spent large amounts of time in the United States. That gave her an edge in the internal power struggles among Chavismo \u2014 the movement started by Ch\u00e1vez, whose many factions include democratic socialists, military hardliners who Ch\u00e1vez led in a 1992 coup attempt and corrupt actors, some with ties to drug trafficking.",
      "Her more worldly outlook, and refined tastes, also made Rodr\u00edguez a favorite of the so-called \u201cboligarchs\u201d \u2014 a new elite that made fortunes during Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian revolution. One of those insiders, media tycoon Raul Gorr\u00edn, worked hand-in-glove with Rodr\u00edguez's back-channel efforts to mend relations with the first Trump administration and helped organize a secret visit by Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, to Caracas in April 2018 for a meeting with Maduro. A few months later, U.S. federal prosecutors unsealed the first of two money laundering indictments against Gorrin.",
      "After Maduro promoted Rodr\u00edguez to vice president in 2018, she gained control over large swaths of Venezuela's oil economy. To help manage the petro-state, she brought in foreign advisers with experience in global markets. Among them were two former finance ministers in Ecuador who helped run a dollarized, export-driven economy under fellow leftist Rafael Correa. Another key associate is French lawyer David Syed, who for years has been trying to renegotiate Venezuela\u2019s foreign debt in the face of crippling U.S. sanctions that make it impossible for Wall Street investors to get repaid.",
      "\u201cShe sacrificed her personal life for her political career,\u201d said one former friend.",
      "As she amassed more power, she crushed internal rivals. Among them: once powerful Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami, who was jailed in 2024 as part of an anti-corruption crackdown spearheaded by Rodr\u00edguez.",
      "In her de-facto role as Venezuela's chief operating officer, Rodr\u00edguez proved a more flexible, trustworthy partner than Maduro. Some have likened her to a sort of Venezuelan Deng Xiaoping \u2014 the architect of modern China.",
      "Hans Humes, chief executive of Greylock Capital Management, said that experience will serve her well as she tries to jump-start the economy, unite Chavismo and shield Venezuela from stricter terms dictated by Trump. Imposing an opposition-led government right now, he said, could trigger bloodshed of the sort that ripped apart Iraq after U.S. forces toppled Saddam Hussein and formed a provisional government including many leaders who had been exiled for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how expats who have been outside of the country for too long think things should be the way it was before they left,\u201d said Humes, who has met with Maduro as well as Rodr\u00edguez on several occasions. \u201cYou need people who know how to work with how things are not how they were.\u201d",
      "Where Rodr\u00edguez's more pragmatic leadership style leaves Venezuela's democracy is uncertain.",
      "Trump, in remarks after Maduro's capture, said Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado lacks the \u201crespect\u201d to govern Venezuela despite her handpicked candidate winning what the U.S. and other governments consider a landslide victory in 2024 presidential elections stolen by Maduro.",
      "Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela during the first Trump administration, said it is impossible for the president to fulfill his goal of banishing criminal gangs, drug traffickers and Middle Eastern terrorists from the Western Hemisphere with the various factions of Chavismo sharing power.",
      "\u201cNothing that Trump has said suggests his administration is contemplating a quick transition away from Delcy. No one is talking about elections,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cIf they think Delcy is running things, they are completely wrong.\u201d",

      "A year after devastating fires in the L",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On the first anniversary of the most destructive wildfires in the L.A. area, the scant home construction projects stand out among the still mostly flattened landscapes.",
      "Fewer than a dozen homes have been rebuilt in Los Angeles County since Jan. 7, 2025, when the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted, killing 31 people and destroying about 13,000 homes and other residential properties.",
      "For those who had insurance, it\u2019s often not enough to cover the costs of construction. Relief organizations are stepping in to help, but progress is slow.",
      "Among the exceptions is Ted Koerner, whose Altadena home was reduced to ash and two chimneys. With his insurance payout tied up, the 67-year-old liquidated about 80% of his retirement holdings, secured contractors quickly, and moved decisively through the rebuilding process.",
      "Shortly before Thanksgiving, Koerner was among the first to finish a rebuild in the aftermath of the fires, which were fueled by drought and hurricane-force winds.",
      "But most do not have options like Koerner.",
      "The streets of the coastal community of Pacific Palisades and Altadena, a community in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, remain lined with dirt lots. In the seaside city of Malibu, foundations and concrete piles rising out of the sand are all that\u2019s left of beachfront homes that once butted against crashing ocean waves.",
      "Neighborhoods are pitch black at night, with few streetlamps replaced. Even many homes that survived are not inhabited as families struggle to clear them of the fire\u2019s toxic contaminants.",
      "Koerner was driven in part by fear that his beloved golden retriever, Daisy Mae, now 13 years old, might not live long enough to move into a new home, given the many months it can take to build even under the best circumstances.",
      "He also did not have to wait for his insurance payout to start construction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we were going to get it done before all of a sudden my dog starts having labored breathing or something else happens,\u201d Koerner said.",
      "Once construction began, his home was completed in just over four months.",
      "Daisy Mae is back lying in her favorite spot in the yard under a 175-year-old Heritage Oak. Koerner said he enjoys his morning coffee while watching her and it brings tears to his eyes.",
      "\u201cWe made it,\u201d he said.",
      "About 900 homes are under construction, potentially on pace to be completed later this year.",
      "Still, many homeowners are stuck as they figure out whether they can pay for the rebuilding process.",
      "Scores of residents have left their communities for good. More than 600 properties where a single-family home was destroyed in the wildfires have been sold, according to real estate data tracker Cotality.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge gaps between the money insurance is paying out, to the extent we have insurance, and what it will actually cost to rebuild and/or remediate our homes,\u201d said Joy Chen, executive director of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a group of 10,000 fire survivors mostly from Altadena.",
      "By December, less than 20% of people who experienced total home loss had closed out their insurance claims, according to a survey by the nonprofit Department of Angels.",

      "Time will bring the scope of problems into focus.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to start to see some real inequality start to emerge where certain neighborhoods, certain types of people, certain types of properties are just lagging way far behind, and that becomes the really important question in the second year of a recovery: Who\u2019s doing well and who is really struggling and why?\u201d Rumbach said.",
      "That\u2019s a key concern in Altadena, which for decades drew aspiring Black homeowners who otherwise faced redlining and other forms of racial discrimination when they sought to buy a home in other L.A.-area communities. In 2024, 81% of Black households in Altadena owned their homes, nearly twice the national Black homeownership rate.",
      "But recent research by UCLA\u2019s Latino Policy & Politics Institute found that, as of August, 7 in 10 Altadena homeowners whose property was severely damaged in last year\u2019s wildfire had not begun taking steps to rebuild or sell their home. Among these, Black homeowners were 73% more likely than others to have taken no action.",
      "Al and Charlotte Bailey have been living in an RV parked on the empty lot where their home once stood.",
      "The Baileys are paying for their rebuild with funds from their insurance payout and a loan. They\u2019re also hoping to receive money from Southern California Edison. Several lawsuits claim its equipmentsparked the wildfire in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe had been here for 41 years and raised our family here, and in one night it was all gone,\u201d said Al Bailey, 77. \u201cWe decided that, whatever it\u2019s going to cost, this is our community.\"",

      "Pipeline safety regulators on Monday assessed their largest fine ever against the company responsible for leaking 1.1 million gallons of oil into the Gulf off the coast of Louisiana in 2023. But the $9.6 million fine isn\u2019t likely to be a major burden for Third Coast to pay.",
      "This single fine is close to the normal total of $8 million to $10 million in all fines that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration hands out each year. But Third Coast has a stake in some 1,900 miles of pipelines, and in September, the Houston-based company announced that it had secured a nearly $1 billion loan.",
      "Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said this spill \u201cresulted from a company-wide systemic failure, indicating the operator\u2019s fundamental inability to implement pipeline safety regulations,\u201d so the record fine is appropriate and welcome.",
      "\u201cHowever, even record fines often fail to be financially meaningful to pipeline operators. The proposed fine represents less than 3% of Third Coast Midstream\u2019s estimated annual earnings,\u201d Caram said. \u201cTrue deterrence requires penalties that make noncompliance more expensive than compliance.\u201d",
      "The agency said Third Coast didn't establish proper emergency procedures, which is part of why the National Transportation Safety Board found that operators failed to shut down the pipeline for nearly 13 hours after their gauges first hinted at a problem. PHMSA also said the company didn't adequately assess the risks or properly maintain the 18-inch Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline.",
      "The agency said the company \u201cfailed to perform new integrity analyses or evaluations following changes in circumstances that identified new and elevated risk factors\u201d for the pipeline.",

      "That echoed what the NTSB said in its final report in June, that \u201cThird Coast missed several opportunities to evaluate how geohazards may threaten the integrity of their pipeline. Information widely available within the industry suggested that land movement related to hurricane activity was a threat to pipelines.\u201d",
      "The NTSB said the leak off the coast of Louisiana was the result of underwater landslides, caused by hazards such as hurricanes, that Third Coast, the pipeline owner, failed to address despite the threats being well known in the industry.",
      "A Third Coast spokesperson said the company has been working to address regulators' concerns about the leak, so it was taken aback by some of the details the agency included in its allegations and the size of the fine.",
      "\u201cAfter constructive engagement with PHMSA over the last two years, we were surprised to see aspects of the recent allegations that we believe are inaccurate and exceed established precedent. We will address these concerns with the agency moving forward,\" the company spokesperson said.",
      "The amount of oil spilled in this incident was far less than the 2010 BP oil disaster, when 134 million gallons were released in the weeks following an oil rig explosion, but it could have been much smaller if workers in the Third Coast control room had acted more quickly, the NTSB said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025.",
      "In three weeks of release, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has cleared $1 billion worldwide. The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic collected $40 million over its third weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d is doing its biggest business overseas; it\u2019s grossed $777.1 million internationally thus far. The Walt Disney Co. on Sunday trumped the $1 billion milestone as \u201ccementing another monumental achievement for James Cameron\u2019s groundbreaking franchise.\u201d",
      "But over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t just about the weekend ticket sales. The whole week was a lucrative one for Hollywood, with most schools still out. What drove ticket sales, beyond \u201cAvatar\u201d? Sydney Sweeney, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "The most sustained success over the holiday collider in theaters belonged to a movie that opened all the way back in November. Yet Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has had remarkable staying power. It landed in second place with $19 million, dipping a mere 4% from the previous weekend.",
      "The animated sequel has amassed $1.59 billion in six weeks. That makes \u201cZootopia 2\u201d Disney\u2019s second highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only 2019\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($1.66 billion).",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the twisty thriller starring Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, also emerged as a holiday-season hit for Lionsgate. It collected $14.9 million over the weekend, giving it $75.7 million domestically over three weeks. It dipped only 3% from last weekend. Internationally, \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d which cost a modest $35 million to make, has added $57.3 million.",
      "Just as Sweeney\u2019s star power is propelling \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d so is Chalamet\u2019s with \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d The A24 release also held well in its third weekend, grossing an estimated $12.6 million. After two weeks of wide release, Josh Safdie\u2019s frenetic table tennis tale has grossed $56 million in North America, passing the director\u2019s previous film, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d ($50 million worldwide).",
      "Just about everything playing in theaters saw small drops from the previous weekend. Sony\u2019s action comedy \u201cAnaconda,\u201d starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, dipped 31% to collect $10 million in second weekend. Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue\u201d dropped only 17% in its second weekend with $5.9 million. The Hugh Jackman-Kate Hudson Neil Diamond cover band movie has earned $25 million domestically.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a wide variety of smaller hits, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Overall sales were up 26.5% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide. U.S. and Canada ticket sales in 2025 amounted to $8.9 billion, a 2% increase from the year earlier, according to Comscore, but about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. That slight improvement was notably less than anticipated and was also boosted by higher ticket prices. Actual tickets sold declined from more than 800 million in 2024 to around 780 million in 2025.",
      "The industry is now awaiting a potentially seismic shift with Warner Bros., one of the most theatrical-friendly studios, agreeing to sell to Netflix. That $83 billion deal awaits regulatory approval.",
      "Yet studios are cautiously optimistic 2026 could be the best box-office year of the decade. A release slate filled with marquee franchises, including new \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d movies, has raised hopes of a turnaround.",

      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",

      "The economy has profited from friction between Washington and Beijing as factories shifted out of China, joining earlier waves of foreign investment by the Japanese and South Koreans that have made Vietnam a global manufacturing hub. But rising labor costs, worker shortages and inadequate infrastructure are exposing the limits to its rapid rise.",
      "With rivals like Indonesia and the Philippines competing hard for new projects, Vietnam is trying to climb into higher-value manufacturing and expand export markets to maintain that momentum. That effort is evident in Bac Ninh.",
      "Traditionally a center for artisans, Bac Ninh\u2019s first boom began around 2008 when Samsung built its first phone factory there, turning Vietnam into its largest offshore manufacturing base.",
      "Now, Chinese companies are pouring in as they diversify their factory locations to skirt U.S. tariffs and other trade restrictions. After Hanoi and Beijing normalized ties in the 1990s, inflows of Chinese investment began to pick up as Chinese firms in places like Bac Ninh tapped Vietnam\u2019s electronics supply chain, labor force and supportive local governments, often aided by Chinese-speaking intermediaries who smooth paperwork and logistics.",
      "But Vietnam is too small to replace China, whose economy is 40 times larger, as the world's factory floor. To try to keep up, its leaders are building new infrastructure, including a highway to the Chinese border that has cut travel time by more than an hour. A railway will connect Hanoi to Haiphong \u2014 Vietnam\u2019s largest seaport \u2014 and then the border town of Lao Cai.",
      "On Dec. 19, Bac Ninh broke ground on the expansion of an industrial zone for high-tech manufacturing, including electronics, pharmaceuticals and clean energy. It's part of a synchronized nationwide push in which Vietnam launched 234 major projects worth more than $129 billion just weeks before a pivotal National Party Congress in January, when leaders will decide the country\u2019s political leadership and economic direction.",
      "In Bac Ninh's downtown, a convenience store bears the name Tmall, after Alibaba\u2019s flagship online marketplace. Signs in Chinese advertise services for investors. Chinese\u2013Vietnamese language schools have opened to help locals and Chinese to learn each others' languages.",
      "But as Chinese companies compete for the best labor and other resources, costs are rising for the \u201cChina plus one\u201d strategy of moving factories out of China to other locations, for example, Apple's shift into India.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming difficult to recruit workers,\u201d said Peng, who works at a telecoms equipment company that moved from China\u2019s southern technology hub of Shenzhen. He gave only one name because he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Labor costs have jumped 10%\u201315% since 2024, he said, \"And we expect them to keep rising.\u201d",
      "Vietnam still need technology, equipment and expertise from China, which had created \"the best manufacturing ecosystem,\" said Jacob Rothman, co-founder and CEO of China-based Velong Enterprises, which makes grill tools and kitchen gadgets and has shifted some production to Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Supply chains and manufacturers in China have benefited from decades of government support, large-scale investment and its huge population, Rothman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t recreate that overnight.\u201d",
      "Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at U.S.-based SEKO Logistics, said while factories making footwear, furniture and technology are still relocating to Vietnam, it lags China in infrastructure and logistics capabilities.",
      "Some of those limits are surfacing in boomtowns like Bac Ninh, where firms are trying to lure workers with higher wages and bonuses, a box of instant noodles on their first day and bus fares if they commute from another city, according to state media.",

      "Few countries have benefitted more from Trump's trade war than Vietnam, whose biggest export market is still the U.S. In 2024, Vietnam ran a $123.5 billion surplus with the U.S., the third largest behind China and Mexico. That irked Trump, who threatened a 46% import tax on Vietnamese goods before settling on 20%.",
      "The two countries are still working toward a deal to keep most tariffs at 20%. Vietnam has offered broad preferential access for U.S. products, the White House said in October. So far, it has largely absorbed the tariffs, running a trade surplus of $121.6 billion in January-November 2025.",
      "The agreement in October by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to a year-long trade truce and lower average tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. to about 47% helped ease some concerns. But persisting uncertainty over tariffs and other trade restrictions means companies aren\u2019t just trying to shift factories out of China but to spread them across several countries, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.",
      "Even with lower U.S. tariffs on China, the calculus still favors moving to Southeast Asia where manufacturing inefficiencies add only about 10% in cost. But while large corporations can shift production easily, smaller firms may struggle to fit a new factory with expensive equipment.",
      "\u201c(The) race to move outside of China is still happening, and it's accelerating,\u201d Rothman said.",
      "Vietnam is still attracting ample foreign investment. Cumulative foreign investment topped $28.5 billion as of September, up 15% from last year. But scrutiny of Vietnam's role as a hub for tariff-dodging transshipments has some manufacturers hedging their bets.",
      "One of SEKO Logistics' customers has shifted some of its furniture making to India, not wanting to \u201cput all their eggs in Vietnam,\u201d Bourke said.",
      "Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, which missed the early gains Vietnam captured, are promoting themselves as alternative manufacturing bases. In the Philippines, a new law allows foreign investors to lease private land for up to 99 years to attract long-term commercial and industrial investment.",
      "Vietnam has a goal of becoming rich by 2045. It aims to become Asia's next \u201ctiger economy,\u201d following export powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan by shifting from low-cost assembly work to manufacture higher-value products like electronics and clean energy equipment.",
      "It's offering incentives like tax breaks on imported machinery and discounted rents to help factory suppliers upgrade and modernize. About a third still use non-automated equipment and only about 10% use robots on their production lines.",
      "The country also is trying to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market by expanding exports to the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India. Overseas trade offices have been asked to share market intelligence and promote products made in Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam knows that rising costs and tougher competition will test how far it \u2014 and places like Bac Ninh \u2014 can climb. Announcing hundreds of projects in December, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh framed the stakes: Vietnam must \u201creach far into the ocean, delve deep underground and soar high into space.\u201d",

      "South Korea and China have pledged to boost trade and safeguard regional stability",
      "BEIJING -- China and South Korea\u2019s leaders pledged to boost trade and safeguard regional stability on Monday during a visit to Beijing by the South Korean president that was overshadowed by North Korea\u2019s recent ballistic missile tests.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of his four-day trip to China \u2014 his first since taking office in June.",
      "As Xi hosted Lee at the Great Hall of the People, the Chinese president stressed the two countries\u2019 \u201cimportant responsibilities in maintaining regional peace and promoting global development,\u201d according to a readout of their meeting broadcast by state-run CCTV.",
      "Lee spoke about opening \u201ca new chapter in the development of Korea-China relations\u201d during \u201cchanging times.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe two countries should make joint contributions to promote peace, which is the foundation for prosperity and growth,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The visit comes as China wants to shore up regional support as tensions rise with Japan. Ties between Beijing and Seoul have fluctuated in recent years over previous conservative South Korean governments' steps to prioritize the U.S. and Japan over China, and allow the U.S. to install a missile defense system on its soil. Lee, a liberal, has promised to improve ties with Beijing, while also strengthening relations with Washington and Tokyo.",
      "Just hours before Lee\u2019s arrival in China, North Korea launched several ballistic missiles into the sea, including, it said, hypersonic missiles, which are designed to travel at more than five times the speed of sound and are very difficult to detect and intercept. Foreign experts doubt that North Korea has developed such a functioning hypersonic weapon.",
      "During the summit, the two countries agreed to continue to explore creative ways to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and confirmed the Chinese resolve to play \u201ca constructive role\u201d in efforts to promote peace, South Korea\u2019s national security adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing.",
      "China is a major ally of North Korea and provides it with an economic lifeline. In past years, China, together with Russia, has repeatedly blocked the U.S. and others' bids to toughen U.N. sanctions on North Korea.",
      "The missile tests came as Pyongyang criticized a U.S. attack on Venezuela that included the removal of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "North Korea, which has long feared the U.S. might seek a change of government in Pyongyang, criticized the attack as a wild violation of Venezuela's sovereignty and an example of the \u201crogue and brutal nature of the U.S.\u201d",
      "China had also condemned the U.S. attack, which it said violated international law and threatened peace in Latin America.",

      "Last week, China staged large-scale military drills around the island for two days to warn against separatist and \u201cexternal interference\u201d forces.",
      "In his meeting with Lee, Xi mentioned China's and South Korea\u2019s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to \u201cjoin hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.\u201d",
      "Regarding South Korea's military cooperation with the U.S., Lee said during an interview with CCTV ahead of his trip that it shouldn't mean that South Korea-China relations should move toward confrontation.",
      "He added that his visit to China aimed to \u201cminimize or eliminate past misunderstandings or contradictions (and) elevate and develop South Korea-China relations to a new stage.\u201d",
      "China and South Korea maintain robust trade ties, with bilateral trade reaching about $273 billion in 2024.",
      "During their meeting, Xi and Lee oversaw the signing of 15 cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection, CCTV reported.",

Beating Montana in the semifinals put Montana State back into the title game for the second straight season, third in five years under Vigen and the fourth berth overall.",
      "Montana State topped that accomplishment with its 14th straight win in a thrilling finish in the first overtime in the 48 years of this title game. The Bobcats led 21-7 at halftime and 28-14 in the third. They needed Jhase McMillan\u2019s block of Michael Cosentino\u2019s 38-yard field goal attempt with 57 seconds left in regulation to keep it tied at 28.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Venus Williams has lost her first singles match of 2026 to fifth-seeded Magda Linette at the WTA Tour tournament in Auckland, New Zealand.",
      "The 45-year-old Williams put up a superb show before losing 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to the No. 52-ranked Linette, who was only two years old when Williams played her first professional singles match.",
      "Tuesday's match was Williams' 1,101st in singles on the WTA Tour. But the competitiveness she showed against a player 12 years her junior will give her confidence as she heads to Australia for the Hobart International and the Australian Open.",
      "The seven-time major champion received wild-card entries into the Auckland tournament and also in Hobart from Jan. 12 and at the first Grand Slam tournament of the year at Melbourne Park.",
      "The Auckland match was Williams' first since she lost 6-3, 2-6, 5-1 to Karolina Muchova in the first round of the U.S. Open last August. She played only three tournaments in 2025, beating Peyton Stearns in July to become the second-oldest woman \u2014 behind Martina Navratilova \u2014 to win a match on the WTA Tour.",
      "Williams appeared fit, moved freely, served seven aces and hit hard on both sides.",

      "\"It was really impressive and I really had to stay calm. She pushes you to a spot you don't want to be and that's where I was for a while, so I'm really glad I was able to refresh and come back with a little bit better game.\u201d",
      "Williams, ranked No. 582 this week, has been a regular visitor to Auckland in the latter part of her career. She beat Caroline Wozniacki in the 2015 final for the 41st of her 46 WTA Tour titles. This year, she told reporters, she felt under no pressure.",

      "\u201cSo hopefully I can look back with the 20/20 vision while I\u2019m in the present, like just let it go, let it flow, enjoy it and be in the moment. That\u2019s not easy to do and that\u2019s why people love sports, right?\u201d",

      "For travelers, CEO John Pfeifer says the goal is fewer delays without compromising safety. The technology is also designed to keep those tarmac tasks moving even during severe weather, like winter storms or extreme heat, when conditions are daunting for human crews, Pfeifer said. Testing with major airlines is already underway, and the robots would likely debut at large hub airports like Atlanta or Dallas, with a goal of rolling them out over the next few years.",

      "LONDON -- Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is facing a backlash from governments around the world after a recent surge in sexualized images of women and children generated without consent by the artificial intelligence-powered tool.",
      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",
      "The European Union's executive arm has denounced Grok while officials and regulators in France, India, Malaysia and Brazil have condemned the platform and called for investigations.",
      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",

      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",

The country's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also ordered the company to review Grok's \"technical and governance framework\" and file a report on actions taken.",

      "Bosch debuted its new AI vehicle extension that aims to turn the cabin into a \u201cproactive companion.\u201d Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, announced Alpamayo, its new vehicle AI initiative designed to help autonomous cars think through complex driving decisions. CEO Jensen Huang called it a \u201cChatGPT moment for physical AI.\u201d",
      "But experts say the push toward a more personalized driving experience is intensifying questions about how much driver data is being collected.",
      "\u201cThe magic of AI should not just mean all privacy and security protections are off,\u201d said Justin Brookman, director of marketplace policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "Unlike smartphones or online platforms, cars have only recently become major repositories of personal data, Brookman said. As a result, the industry is still trying to establish the \u201crules of the road\u201d for what automakers and tech companies are allowed to do with driver data.",
      "That uncertainty is compounded by the uniquely personal nature of cars, Brookman said. Many people see their vehicles as an extension of themselves \u2014 or even their homes \u2014 which he said can make the presence of cameras, microphones and other monitoring tools feel especially invasive.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",
      "Whatever the reason, the T1's ongoing absence from the smartphone market didn't come as a surprise to International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo.",
      "\u201cWe have always been quite skeptical about this phone,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cThey are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let's see if this thing comes to life or not.\u201d",
      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran faces a new round of protests challenging the country's theocracy, but it seems like the only thing people there want to talk about is half a world away: Venezuela.",
      "Since the U.S. military seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend, Iranian state media headlines and officials have condemned the operation. In the streets and even in some official conversations, however, there's a growing question over whether a similar mission could target the Islamic Republic's top officials including the supreme leader, 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The paranoia feeds into wider worries among Iranians. Many fear that close U.S. ally Israel will target Iran again as it did during the 12-day war it launched against Tehran in June. Israel killed a slew of top military officials and nuclear scientists, and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. Khamenei is believed to have gone into hiding for his protection.",
      "\u201cGod bless our leader, we should be careful too,\" said Saeed Seyyedi, a 57-year-old teacher in Tehran, worried the U.S. could act as it did in Venezuela.",
      "\"The U.S. has always been after plots against Iran, especially when issues like oil, Israel are part of the case. In addition, it can be complicated when it is mixed with the Russia-Ukraine war, the Lebanese (group) Hezbollah and drug accusations.\u201d",
      "The U.S. long has accused the Iranian-backed Hezbollah of running drug-smuggling operations to fund its operations, including in Latin America, which the group denies.",
      "Immediately after Maduro\u2019s seizure, an analyst on Iranian state television claimed, without offering evidence, that the U.S. and Israel had plans during the war last year to kidnap Iranian officials with a team of dual-national Iranians. Even for conspiracy-minded Iranian television, airing such a claim is unusual.",
      "Then on Sunday night, the prominent Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Javedan warned an audience at prayers in Tehran University that Khamenei's life was in danger.",
      "\u201cSomeone said he had a bad dream that the leader\u2019s life is in danger,\" Javedan said, without elaborating. \"Please pray.\u201d",
      "However, Iran is roughly twice the size of Venezuela and has what analysts consider to be a much stronger military and robust security forces. The memory of Operation Eagle Claw, a failed U.S. special forces mission to rescue hostages held after the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran, also haunts Washington.",
      "Then there's the political situation in Iran, with its theocracy protected by hard-liners within the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, who answer only to Khamenei. They could launch assassinations, cyberattacks and assaults on shipping in the Mideast, warned Farzin Nadimi, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who studies Iran\u2019s military.",
      "And crucially, Iran also still has fissile nuclear material.",
      "\u201cIn the grand-strategy scheme of things, they need to think about the day after,\u201d Nadimi said of anyone considering a Venezuela-style raid. \u201cIran is a much more complex political situation. They have to calculate the costs and benefits.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.",
      "\u201cAmerican dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, \u201cwill never be questioned again.\u201d",
      "In the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders\u2019 messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time.\u201d said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.",
      "In the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland \u2014 where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons \u2014 and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to \u201cget their act together\u201d fighting drug cartels.",
      "Trump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is \u201cgoing down\u201d now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia \u2014 the epicenter of global cocaine production \u2014 \"sounds good to me.\"",
      "The Republican president has also said his administration will \u201crun\u201d Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not \u201cdo what\u2019s right.\u201d He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.",

      "The Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump\u2011aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non\u2011aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. \u201cabsolutely\u201d needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.",
      "\u201cIf the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\u201d Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.",
      "In the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.",

      "The Coast Guard said there were no injuries to the crew members of the Arctic Sea, a 134-foot (41-meter) boat owned by the Coastal Villages Region Fund and fishing for tanner crab.",
      "The ship grounded Monday on the northern shore of Saint George Island, the southernmost of the small Pribilofs islands group with fewer than 100 residents, predominantly Aleuts. The group of islands is located about 750 miles (1,207 kilometers) west of Anchorage.",

      "\u201cThe aircrew also conducted the hoists of all nine crewmembers and the rescue swimmer in about 25 minutes, a testament to the skill and professionalism of the aircrew,\u201d Regan said.",
      "Winds of nearly 60 mph (96 kph) and 10-foot (3-meter) seas caused the Arctic Sea to take on water and eventually go aground about 4 a.m. Monday. Video taken by a resident from atop the cliff showed waves slapping over the grounded ship.",

      "A year after devastating fires in the L",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On the first anniversary of the most destructive wildfires in the L.A. area, the scant home construction projects stand out among the still mostly flattened landscapes.",
      "Fewer than a dozen homes have been rebuilt in Los Angeles County since Jan. 7, 2025, when the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted, killing 31 people and destroying about 13,000 homes and other residential properties.",
      "For those who had insurance, it\u2019s often not enough to cover the costs of construction. Relief organizations are stepping in to help, but progress is slow.",
      "Among the exceptions is Ted Koerner, whose Altadena home was reduced to ash and two chimneys. With his insurance payout tied up, the 67-year-old liquidated about 80% of his retirement holdings, secured contractors quickly, and moved decisively through the rebuilding process.",
      "Shortly before Thanksgiving, Koerner was among the first to finish a rebuild in the aftermath of the fires, which were fueled by drought and hurricane-force winds.",
      "But most do not have options like Koerner.",
      "The streets of the coastal community of Pacific Palisades and Altadena, a community in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, remain lined with dirt lots. In the seaside city of Malibu, foundations and concrete piles rising out of the sand are all that\u2019s left of beachfront homes that once butted against crashing ocean waves.",
      "Neighborhoods are pitch black at night, with few streetlamps replaced. Even many homes that survived are not inhabited as families struggle to clear them of the fire\u2019s toxic contaminants.",
      "Koerner was driven in part by fear that his beloved golden retriever, Daisy Mae, now 13 years old, might not live long enough to move into a new home, given the many months it can take to build even under the best circumstances.",
      "He also did not have to wait for his insurance payout to start construction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we were going to get it done before all of a sudden my dog starts having labored breathing or something else happens,\u201d Koerner said.",
      "Once construction began, his home was completed in just over four months.",
      "Daisy Mae is back lying in her favorite spot in the yard under a 175-year-old Heritage Oak. Koerner said he enjoys his morning coffee while watching her and it brings tears to his eyes.",
      "\u201cWe made it,\u201d he said.",
      "About 900 homes are under construction, potentially on pace to be completed later this year.",
      "Still, many homeowners are stuck as they figure out whether they can pay for the rebuilding process.",
      "Scores of residents have left their communities for good. More than 600 properties where a single-family home was destroyed in the wildfires have been sold, according to real estate data tracker Cotality.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge gaps between the money insurance is paying out, to the extent we have insurance, and what it will actually cost to rebuild and/or remediate our homes,\u201d said Joy Chen, executive director of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a group of 10,000 fire survivors mostly from Altadena.",
      "By December, less than 20% of people who experienced total home loss had closed out their insurance claims, according to a survey by the nonprofit Department of Angels.",

In 2024, 81% of Black households in Altadena owned their homes, nearly twice the national Black homeownership rate.",
      "But recent research by UCLA\u2019s Latino Policy & Politics Institute found that, as of August, 7 in 10 Altadena homeowners whose property was severely damaged in last year\u2019s wildfire had not begun taking steps to rebuild or sell their home. Among these, Black homeowners were 73% more likely than others to have taken no action.",
      "Al and Charlotte Bailey have been living in an RV parked on the empty lot where their home once stood.",
      "The Baileys are paying for their rebuild with funds from their insurance payout and a loan. They\u2019re also hoping to receive money from Southern California Edison. Several lawsuits claim its equipmentsparked the wildfire in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe had been here for 41 years and raised our family here, and in one night it was all gone,\u201d said Al Bailey, 77. \u201cWe decided that, whatever it\u2019s going to cost, this is our community.\"",

But while Maduro is in jail in New York on drug trafficking charges, the leaders of his repressive administration remain in charge.",
      "The nation's opposition \u2014 backed by consecutive Republican and Democratic administrations in the U.S. \u2014 for years vowed to immediately replace Maduro with one of their own and restore democracy to the oil-rich country. But U.S. President Donald Trump delivered them a heavy blow by allowing Maduro\u2019s vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, to assume control.",

      "The U.S. seized Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores in a military operation Saturday, removing them both from their home on a military base in Venezuela\u2019s capital, Caracas. Hours later, Trump said the U.S. would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela and expressed skepticism that Machado could ever be its leader.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the support within, or the respect within, the country,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice woman, but she doesn\u2019t have the respect.\u201d",
      "Ironically, Machado's unending praise for the American president, including dedicating her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump and her backing of U.S. campaigns to deport Venezuelan migrants and attack alleged drug traffickers in international waters, has lost her some support at home.",
      "Machado rose to become Maduro's strongest opponent in recent years, but his government barred her from running for office to prevent her from challenging \u2014 and likely beating \u2014 him in the 2024 presidential election. She chose retired ambassador Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia to represent her on the ballot.",

Instead, the vice president \u2014 which is not an elected position \u2014 takes over for up to 90 days, with a provision to extend to six months if approved by the National Assembly, which is controlled by the ruling party.",
      "In its ruling, Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day limit, leading to speculation that Rodr\u00edguez could try to cling to power as she seeks to unite ruling party factions and shield it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.",

      "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s first court hearing \u2014 a heavily secured spectacle where he proclaimed he is still Venezuela\u2019s president and pleaded \u201csoy inocente\u201d \u2014 was merely the beginning of a legal odyssey that could keep him locked up and out of power for years, ...",
      "NEW YORK -- Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s first court hearing in the U.S. \u2014 a spectacle where he proclaimed he is still Venezuela\u2019s president \u2014 was merely the beginning of a legal odyssey that could keep him locked up and out of power for years, maybe even the rest of his life.",
      "The deposed South American leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned Monday on drug trafficking charges, days after U.S. forces seized them from their Caracas home in a stunning middle-of-the-night raid. Both pleaded not guilty.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has defended the military action as a \u201csurgical law enforcement operation\u201d to apprehend Maduro in a criminal case that U.S. prosecutors first brought six years ago. In court, Maduro called it a kidnapping and declared himself a prisoner of war.",
      "While Venezuela reckons with the geopolitical fallout, Maduro and Flores are locked up in New York City, about 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers) away. Their next court appearance is scheduled for March 17.",
      "Here\u2019s what\u2019s likely to happen next in their legal case:",
      "It is a long shot, but Maduro, 63, and Flores, 69, can ask the judge to release them on bail, which would allow them to await trial at a location other than jail. Neither defendant made that request on Monday, but their lawyers suggested they might in the future.",
      "The judge, Alvin Hellerstein, told the lawyers he will welcome requests for bail \u201cwhenever, and as often you think it appropriate.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean he would agree to let Maduro and Flores out.",
      "Both are charged with serious offenses that could carry life sentences, and prosecutors could argue they are flight risks \u2014 meaning they may try to leave the country to avoid prosecution if they are freed. Maduro is accused of narco-terrorism conspiracy. He and his wife are accused of being part of a conspiracy to import cocaine into the U.S. and possessing machine guns.",
      "Judges rarely grant bail in such cases. Manuel Noriega was not granted bail after the U.S. accused him of drug trafficking, invaded Panama and removed him as that country's leader in 1989. Sometimes defendants don\u2019t even ask. Lawyers for the recently pardoned former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, never sought bail when he was charged in the U.S. with drug trafficking. Nor did lawyers for Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, the drug lord known as \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d when he was brought to the U.S from Mexico.",
      "Flores\u2019 lawyer, Mark Donnelly, said she sustained \u201csignificant injuries\u201d during her capture and needs an X-ray and medical evaluation because she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs. She appeared in court with bandages on her forehead and over her temple and eyelid.",
      "Maduro\u2019s lawyer, Barry Pollack, told the judge Maduro has \u201chealth and medical issues that will require attention\u201d while he is detained. He did not specify what those issues are. The judge told both lawyers to work with prosecutors to ensure Flores and Maduro receive the proper care.",
      "The federal jail where Flores and Maduro are being held, the Metropolitan Detention Center, has a medical unit with examination rooms and a dental suite. But the jail has also been accused of botching treatment, including missed cancer diagnoses.",

A message seeking comment was left by The Associated Press for Venezuela\u2019s still-open mission to the United Nations.",
      "Maduro may need the meetings, though, in part to ensure that his legal bills can be paid. Maduro and Flores have been under U.S. sanctions for years, making it illegal for any American to take money from them without securing a license from the Treasury Department.",

      "After Noriega's capture by the U.S. military in 1989, his lawyers argued that he was immune from prosecution as a sovereign head of a foreign state. That argument ultimately failed, however, in part because Noriega never held the title of president during his six-year de facto rule.",
      "Maduro claims to have won three popular elections, but the U.S. hasn't recognized him as Venezuela's legitimate leader for years, and thus not entitled to sovereign immunity.",
      "It is possible that a legal battle over the legality of the U.S. prosecution will stretch on for some time, eventually landing with appeals courts.",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice has revealed that the shooter who killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor planned the attack for years",
      "BOSTON -- The man identified as the shooter who killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor planned the attack for years and left behind videos in which he confessed to the murders but gave no motive, according to information released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Claudio Neves Valente, 48, a former Brown student and Portuguese national, was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility after he killed two students and wounded nine others in an engineering building on Dec. 13. Two days later he killed MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro in his home in the Boston suburb of Brookline.",
      "Justice Department officials said Tuesday that during the search of the storage facility where Neves Valente\u2019s body was found on Dec. 18, the FBI recovered an electronic device containing a series of short videos made by Neves Valente after the shootings.",
      "In the recordings, the shooter admitted in Portuguese that he had been working out details for at least six semesters. He did not give a motive for targeting Brown or the professor, with whom he attended school in Portugal decades ago.",
      "In an English-translated transcript provided by the Justice Department, Neves Valente said he felt he had nothing to apologize for. He also complained in the videos about injuring his eye in the shootings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me,\u201d he said.",
      "He explicitly addressed baseless claims spread by conservative influencer Laura Loomer after the attack that the Brown shooter had spoken in Arabic, saying something like \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d upon entering the auditorium.",
      "Neves Valente said he did not speak a word of Arabic or intend to make any kind of statement. If he said anything, he \u201cmust have made an exclamation like, \u2018Oh no!\u2019 or something like that,\u201d to express disappointment that the auditorium appeared to be empty when he entered, he said. Students were hiding under desks, but Neves Valente thought they\u2019d already escaped through an emergency exit.",
      "\u201cI never wanted to do it in an auditorium. I wanted to do it in a regular room,\u201d he said. \u201cI had plenty of opportunities. Especially this semester, I had plenty of opportunities, but I always chickened out.\u201d",
      "He insisted he was not mentally ill. He said he did not want to be famous and the video was not a manifesto.",
      "Neves Valente said his \u201conly objective was to leave more or less\u201d on his \u201cown terms\u201d and to ensure he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the one who ended up suffering the most from all this.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, that cannot happen. So if you don\u2019t like it, tough luck,\u201d he said. Neves Valente called his execution of the murders \u201ca little incompetent.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut at least something was done,\u201d he said.",

      "According to police, the witness had several encounters with Neves Valente before the attack. As police posted images of the person of interest, the witness began posting on the social media forum Reddit that he recognized the person and theorized that police should look into \u201cpossibly a rental\u201d gray Nissan. Reddit users urged him to inform the FBI, and the witness said he did.",

      "The seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.",
      "Trump promised his voters that \u201cAmerica First\u201d would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it \u201ccan't seem to find a way there.\u201d",
      "The geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?",
      "Early on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.",
      "Against that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who \u201cvoted for me are thrilled. They said, \u2018This is what we voted for.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI support him so far,\u201d Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. \u201cUntil he messes up, I support him.\u201d",

      "Not all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.",

      "He added: \u201cI don\u2019t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela\u2019s business.\u201d He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. \u201cDepending on how you look at it,\u201d he said, \u201cthis was an act of war.\u201d",

He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.",

      "The 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as \u201ca powerful man who follows through on his word and isn\u2019t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.\u201d",
      "Mary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders \u201cwould make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.\u201d",
      "Still, Lussier wouldn\u2019t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.",

      "In an interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Glaser described the process of making jokes for the awards show as \"strategic,\" saying, \"you have to be very delicate about making jokes that aren't going to ruin anyone's night, but you also want to give the people at home \u2026 something to laugh at and you want to poke fun at the people that they're dying for you to make fun of.\"",
      "She added picking the perfect jokes for the show is \"one of \u2026 the most difficult jobs I've ever done.\"",

    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it about him that attracted you?\"",
      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",
      "Braver asked, \"How did you feel when you were told that?\"",
      "\"You know, I wasn't surprised,\" she replied. \"It's not like today where, you know, you can get up and do all your protesting. It wasn't like that. You said, 'OK, move on.'\"",
      "And move on she did. She was one of the first black dancers at the Metropolitan Opera, where she also became a choreographer.\u00a0 And she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Drama, where she taught actors how to move.",
      "She is still performing. But she has never forgotten the lessons of history and the injustice she and other Black artists have faced",
      "And so, de Lavallade became one of the Kennedy Center Honorees who announced she would boycott the now-canceled White House reception after President Trump seemed to equate White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville with protesters who opposed them.",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "\"I'm not political,\" she said. \"I have my own way of being political. That's the first time I've ever felt that I ... I just can't.\"",
      "Braver said, \"Some people would say, 'Well, even so, he's our president, and it's just fitting to go.'\"",
      "To which de Lavallade responded, \"I am 86 now. I have all these years, I have done what anybody asked me to, and this is the first time in my life I've ever said no. And I think at this time, it's my privilege.\"",
      "But Carmen de Lavallade will be there at tonight's Kennedy Center gala savoring her award for a life well-danced:",
      "\"I'm glad to think that whatever I did meant something, that really meant something,\" she said. \"That's what I'm pleased about.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:28:58 -0500",
    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, have entered the the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections have expired for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",
      "\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie, the first novel featuring elderly amateur detective Miss Marple.\"The Secret of the Old Clock\" by Carolyn Keene, the first appearance of teen detective Nancy Drew, and three follow-ups.\"The Little Engine That Could\" by Watty Piper.Fleischer Studios' \"Dizzy Dishes,\" the first cartoon in which Betty Boop appears.Disney's \"The Chain Gang\" and \"The Picnic,\" both depicting the earliest versions of Mickey's dog Pluto.The initial four months of \"Blondie\" comic strips by Chic Young, featuring the earliest iterations of the titular character and her then-boyfriend, Dagwood.The film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" directed by Lewis Milestone, Best Picture winner at the 3rd Academy Awards.\"King of Jazz,\" directed by John Murray Anderson, Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film.\"Animal Crackers,\" directed by Victor Heerman and starring the Marx Brothers.\"The Big Trail,\" directed by Raoul Walsh, John Wayne's first turn as leading man.\"But Not For Me,\" music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin.\"Georgia on My Mind,\" music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell.\"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, lyrics by Gus Kahn.\"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" music by Al Sherman, lyrics by Al Lewis.Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",

      "Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",
      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "summary": "New research recommends against drinking coffee or tea served by airlines, urging travelers to stick to bottled water.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "summary": "FDA-approved semaglutide drug is the first GLP-1 pill for weight loss available in the U.S., according to drugmaker Novo Nordisk.",
    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

    "summary": "New research recommends against drinking coffee or tea served by airlines, urging travelers to stick to bottled water.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "summary": "A prediction market user won big after wagering $32,000 that the U.S. would capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Was it insider trading?",
    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:36:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

    "story": [
      "Representatives from petroleum giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are planning to meet with the Trump administration later this week to discuss Venezuela, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The meeting is expected to take place Wednesday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is attending the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami, a Department of Energy spokesperson said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",
      "\"Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,\" Williams added.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",
      "Customers eligible for automatic payments are those who signed up for Prime through what the FTC calls a \"challenged enrollment flow,\" including pages such as Amazon's shipping selection page and its single-page checkout. Consumers who used three or fewer Prime benefits within a 12-month period are also due for refunds without submitting a claim.",
      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",
      "If you signed up for Prime through a \"challenged enrollment flow\" between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, and you used Prime benefits between three and 10 times in a 12-month period, you may need to file a claim to get money under the settlement.",
      "Eligible customers who need to file a claim will receive an email or a mailed notice, according to the settlement website.",
      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",
      "However, some customers may see smaller amounts if, for instance, they signed up for a trial membership that charged less than the regular Prime fee, the site notes.",
      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",
      "How will the Amazon Prime refunds be issued?",
      "The refunds will be sent through PayPal, Venmo or mailed checks, according to the settlement site. People who file claims can specify their preferred payment method.",

    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said.

      "Energy industry stocks and oil prices are rising after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife in a military operation on Saturday.",
      "In Wall Street trading on Monday, shares in Chevron \u2014 the only U.S. oil company\u00a0operating in Venezuela\u00a0\u2014 jumped $7.95, or 5.1%, on the day to close at $163.85. Exxon Mobil's stock increased 2.2%, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.6%",
      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",

    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",

      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",

    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",
      "\"Spicy mode\" controversy",
      "Grok has previously drawn scrutiny before for generating sexually inappropriate content. Grok Imagine, xAI's artificial intelligence video generation platform,\u00a0unveiled \"Spicy Mode\" last year, framing it as a way for creators to tell \"edgier\" and \"more visually daring narratives.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax. He had previously resided in San Francisco.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla on Friday reported a second straight annual drop in electric vehicle sales, as the phaseout of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and mounting competition weighed on demand. With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.",
      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:15:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Steep U.S. import duties targeting 13 Italian pasta makers will be sharply reduced, Italy's foreign ministry said on Jan. 1.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The final results of Commerce's review will be announced in March, after which the duties will go into effect.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/machado-venezuelans-very-grateful-to-trump-ousting-maduro-after-he-suggests-she-cant-lead/",
    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:49:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado hailed President Trump for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power in a network exclusive interview with CBS News \u2014 and made the case for why her political coalition should lead the country.",
    "story": [
      "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado hailed President Trump for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power and argued her coalition has a mandate to lead the country moving forward \u2014 even as Mr. Trump leaves doubts about whether Machado could take power herself.",
      "Machado spoke to \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in a network exclusive on Tuesday, just three days after the U.S. military executed a daring mission to capture Maduro, ending the authoritarian president's nearly 13-year reign over Venezuela.",
      "Machado has aligned herself with Mr. Trump in recent months, backing his administration's months-long pressure campaign against Maduro's regime and dedicating her Nobel Peace Prize to him. When Mr. Trump ordered last weekend's surprise operation to pluck Maduro from Caracas and fly him to New York on drug charges, Machado vocally celebrated the move.",
      "Since then, Machado has called for her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 whom the U.S. recognizes as the winner of the country's 2024 election \u2014 to take over Venezuela as soon as possible, replacing the Maduro operatives who are still running the country.",
      "But Mr. Trump has declined to back Machado's movement. He said Saturday that it would be \"very tough\" for her to run Venezuela and doubted she has enough support within the country, saying: \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.\"",
      "Pressed on why she believes Mr. Trump said that about her, Machado suggested there could be lingering worries about Venezuela's stability. She told CBS News that Venezuela \"has been taken over by a criminal narcoterrorist system\" backed by guerrilla groups and U.S. adversaries like Iran and Cuba, and \"there is fear that these groups will resist a peaceful transition.\"",
      "However, Machado said she believes \"a wide majority of the military and police in Venezuela also support an orderly transition to democracy.\"",
      "She continued: \"I believe we have a united country.\"",
      "Asked if she believes she is the right person to lead Venezuela in the first chapter of its post-Maduro future, Machado told CBS News \"the people of Venezuela have already chosen,\" and her coalition is \"ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated.\"",
      "She pointed to the country's heavily contested 2024 election, when Gonz\u00e1lez faced off against Maduro because the government banned Machado \u2014 who won the opposition's primary \u2014 from running herself. Maduro's government declared him the winner, but those results were rejected by much of the international community and are widely seen as tainted by pervasive fraud.",
      "Machado \u2014 who told CBS News she has not spoken with Mr. Trump this year \u2014 said Venezuelans are \"very grateful\" to Mr. Trump. She called Maduro's arrest a \"major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela.\"",
      "She acknowledged that the country is not there yet. She alleged that Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, played a key role in Maduro's corruption, was \"one of the main architects\" of Venezuela's security state and served as the \"main link\" between the South American country and Russia and Iran.",
      "\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.",
      "Asked if she has a message for Mr. Trump, she said: \"Trust the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "\"We've come a long way,\" she said, pointing to what she called a \"landslide\" win in 2024 despite widespread allegations of fraud. \"So imagine if there had been free and fair elections.\"",
      "She predicted that Venezuela \"will be not only a security ally to the United States, but a country of prosperity,\" allowing millions of Venezuelans who have left the country due to economic deprivation and political threats to return home. And she said she supports U.S. oil companies returning to Venezuela, backing a recent push by Mr. Trump.",
      "She also predicted that the remnants of Maduro's government and any violent groups in the country will be \"neutralized.\"",
      "\"I dare to say there is no other society in this hemisphere as cohesive and united as Venezuelan society,\" she said. \"More than 90% of our population wants the same. We want to live with respect, with dignity, with justice and opportunities.\"",
      "Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela: \"We are ready and willing\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetained Americans are used as \"trading chips,\" Marine imprisoned under Maduro says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachado says Maduro's No. 2 was \"one of the main architects\" of his oppressive regime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump blames Maduro for Americans' overdose deaths.

      "\"We are ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated,\" she said.",
      "It's unclear when \u2014 or whether \u2014 Gonz\u00e1lez or Machado could return to Venezuela and help lead the country. Maduro's handpicked vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, is currently Venezuela's interim president. Machado told CBS News that Rodriguez is \"nothing like a moderate\" and \"nobody trusts her,\" citing the key role she played in the Maduro regime.",
      "And President Trump has doubted that Machado could take over, telling reporters on Saturday: \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.\"",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's comments, Machado emphasized that she is \"very grateful\" for his decision to order Maduro's capture and arrest on drug charges.",
      "\"A few weeks ago, people would have said it was impossible to reach this point. And President Trump's leadership and courage has brought Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to face justice. And this is huge,\" Machado said. \"This is a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela.\"",

    "summary": "After the U.S. deposed Maduro, Trump and top officials did not rule out efforts at overthrow or annexation in other countries. Here's what they've said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "Administration officials are discussing a \"range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

    "summary": "Two U.S. intelligence officials said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing Soviet-era defense systems and armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 American forces planned to intercept an evading oil tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans told CBS News Monday.",
      "Two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News Tuesday that Russia had sent a submarine and other Russian naval vessels to escort the tanker Marinera, which sails under a Russian flag. The Wall Street Journal was first to\u00a0report\u00a0on the escort.",
      "It is unclear where the U.S. plans stood now that Russian naval assets had been dispatched. It is not uncommon for military operations to be shelved entirely.",
      "Since last month, U.S. forces have pursued the Marinera, a crude oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1, as the U.S. continues its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Since September, the United States has steadily turned the screws, accusing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government of using multiple vessels to move drugs north toward American shores.",
      "Two U.S. intelligence officials also said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes \u2014 as well as portable Soviet-era air defense systems. The discussions took place before the capture of Maduro and his wife by U.S. special forces on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday morning, the officials told CBS News.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and said the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker last month, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official previously said.",
      "Maduro has rejected the U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and instead accuses the United States of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement. The latest confrontation is one in a series of U.S. actions that include charging Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism. American strikes on multiple vessels have killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "The Marinera was a ship previously flagged out of Panama and was sanctioned for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading by the Treasury Department in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. But now the ship is sailing under the Russian flag, which potentially could complicate sensitive talks between the United States and Russia over ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Monday, no reply was returned from the White House, Pentagon or State Department. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The two U.S. officials with knowledge of U.S. military operational planning had said Monday the interdiction mission could come as early as this week, but like any Defense Department plans, the operation could ultimately be shelved. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "Like the Marinera, The Skipper was also sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "Ships like the Marinera, The Skipper and the Centuries, another oil tanker the United States seized last month, are all a part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "President Trump unilaterally imposed a \"total and complete blockade\" on already sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "On Monday, The New York Times reported that at least 16 oil tankers have attempted to evade the U.S. naval blockade by disguising their geographical locations or turning off their transmission beacons.",
      "If the Marinera is captured by American forces, it would be the third oil tanker seized by the United States since it began its campaign against Venezuela in early September.",

    "story": [
      "A new webpage under the official whitehouse.gov domain, rolled out five years after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, rewrites the history of the attack on the Capitol that took place as Congress was affirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The website expresses views long promoted by President Trump that the Jan. 6 attack was a \"peaceful march,\" blames Capitol Police for \"escalating tensions,\" and repeats Mr. Trump's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.",
      "\"The Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6, branding peaceful patriotic protesters as 'insurrectionists' and framing the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump\u2014despite no evidence of armed rebellion or intent to overthrow the government,\" the new webpage says.",
      "White House spokesperson Steven Cheung posted a link to it on social media and wrote \"Want to know the TRUTH? Get all the facts here.\" The White House's official X account also posted a link to it, writing \"Now see the REAL Jan. 6 story.\"",
      "Thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol that day and breached the building after smashing through windows on the first floor. They vandalized the Capitol, forced the evacuation of lawmakers and their staff and assaulted police officers on site with flagpoles, bear spray and other objects. More than 150 officers were injured. Five police officers who served at the Capitol died in the days and weeks afterward.",
      "One woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed by Capitol Police as a crowd tried to enter the House chamber, while three others died amid the chaos.",
      "On the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term, he pardoned more than 1,500 people who were convicted or charged in the attack, among them, individuals convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "The new webpage puts forth a different view of the president's clemency, declaring Mr. Trump pardoned \"January 6 defendants who were unfairly targeted, overcharged, and used as political examples. They were not protected by the leaders who failed them. They were punished to cover incompetence.\"",
      "It's a version of history that Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, disputed on the Senate floor Tuesday, as he stood by a Jan. 6 plaque commemorating the officers who protected the Capitol and Congress on Jan. 6. \"We let bad people go,\" he said, noting that some of the pardoned rioters have been arrested again.",
      "The White House webpage claims that when the crowd arrived at the Capitol that day, \"Capitol Police aggressively fire tear gas, flash bangs, and rubber munitions into crowds of peaceful protesters, injuring many and deliberately escalating tensions.\" It goes on to claim, \"Video evidence shows officers inexplicably removing barricades, opening Capitol doors, and even waving attendees inside the building\u2014actions that facilitated entry\u2014while simultaneously deploying violent force against others. These inconsistent and provocative tactics turned a peaceful demonstration into chaos.\"",
      "The site does not include accounts by some police officers in congressional testimony that conflict with the White House version. One officer described it as \"a war scene.\"",
      "The webpage also claims former Vice President Mike Pence could have rejected the electoral votes but chose \"not to exercise that power in an act of cowardice and sabotage,\" even though the vice president's role in certifying Biden's victory was ceremonial.

      "\"President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,\" Leavitt said. \"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal.\"",

      "Denmark has long rebuffed the Trump administration's interest in Greenland, reiterating that rebuke this week.

      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",

      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",

      "Among his accomplishments was helping sponsor legislation upgrading the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado to a national park.",
      "His abrupt decision to switch parties in 1995 stunned Democratic leaders as well as his Colorado constituents. He was angry with Democrats at the time for killing a balanced-budget amendment in the Senate.",
      "\"It didn't change me. I didn't change my voting record. For instance, I had a sterling voting record as a Democrat on labor. I still do as a Republican. And on minorities and women's issues,\" he said.",
      "After he retired, he focused partly on the Native American jewelry that helped make him wealthy and was put on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. He also founded Ben Nighthorse Consultants which focused on federal policy, including Native American affairs and natural resources.",
      "Sen. John Hickenlooper, Colorado's junior U.S. senator, was among those who shared remembrances of Campbell after learning the news.",
      "\"He was a master jeweler with a reputation far beyond the boundaries of Colorado. I will not forget his acts of kindness. He will be sorely missed,\" Hickenlooper said on X.",
      "Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents Colorado's 1st Congressional District,  said on X: \"He was truly one of a kind, and I am thinking of his family in the wake of his loss.\"",
      "Shanan Campbell confirmed that Cambell's wife \"of almost 60 years,\" Linda Campbell, was among those who were with him when he died.",
      "Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican who represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, wrote on X: \"Colorado lost a true legend in former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. A proud Northern Cheyenne, Olympian, veteran, and trailblazing leader who championed our great state.\" She said that he and Linda \"were pioneers for Colorado and built a legacy of strength, service, and innovation that will inspire generations to come.\"",
      "Campbell never lost an election",
      "In 1982, Campbell was planning to deliver his jewelry to California, but bad weather grounded his plane. He was killing time in the southern Colorado city of Durango when he went to a county Democratic meeting and wound up giving a speech for a friend running for sheriff.",
      "Democrats were looking for someone to challenge a GOP legislative candidate and sounded out Campbell during the meeting. \"Like a fish, I was hooked,\" he said.",
      "His opponent, Don Whalen, was a popular former college president who \"looked like he was out of a Brooks Brothers catalog,\" Campbell recalled. \"I don't think anybody gave me any kind of a chance. ... I just think I expended a whole lot of energy to prove them wrong.\"",
      "Campbell hit the streets, ripping town maps out of the Yellow Pages and walking door to door to talk with people. He recalled leaving a note at a house in Cortez where no one was home when he heard a car roar into the driveway, gravel flying and brakes squealing.",
      "The driver jumped out, tire iron in hand, and screamed that Campbell couldn't have his furniture. \"Aren't you the repossession company?\" the man asked.",
      "\"And I said, 'No man, I'm just running for office.' We got to talking, and I think the guy voted for me.\"",
      "Campbell went on to win and he never lost an election thereafter, moving from the Colorado House to three terms in the U.S. House and then to the Senate.",
      "Born April 13, 1933, in Auburn, California, Campbell served in the Air Force in Korea from 1951 to 1953 and received a bachelor's degree from San Jose State University in 1957. He attended Meiji University in Tokyo from 1960 to 1964, was captain of the U.S. judo team in the 1964 Olympics and won a gold medal in the Pan American Games.",
      "Campbell once called then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt a \"forked-tongued snake\" for opposing a water project near the southern Colorado town of Ignacio, which Campbell promoted as a way to honor the water rights of the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes.",
      "He clashed with environmentalists on everything from mining law and grazing reforms to setting aside land for national monuments.",
      "Despite all this -- or perhaps because of it -- voters loved him. In 1998, Campbell won reelection to the Senate by routing Democrat Dottie Lamm, the wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm, despite his switch to the GOP. He was the only Native American in the Senate at the time.",
      "Campbell said his values -- liberal on social issues, conservative on fiscal ones -- were shaped by his life. Children's causes were dear to him because he and his sister spent time in an orphanage when his father was in jail and his mother had tuberculosis.",
      "Organized labor won his backing because hooking up with the Teamsters and learning to drive a truck got him out of the California tomato fields. His time as a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy in California in the late 1960s and early '70s made him a law enforcement advocate.",
      "His decision to retire from politics, Campbell said, had nothing to do with allegations that Ginnie Kontnik, his former chief of staff, solicited kickbacks from another staffer and that his office lobbied for a contract for a technology company with ties to the former senator.",
      "He referred both matters to the Senate Ethics Committee. In 2007, Kontnik pleaded guilty to a federal charge of not reporting $2,000 in income.",
      "\"I guess there was some disappointment\" with those charges, Campbell said. \"But a lot of things happen in Washington that disappoint you. You just have to get over them because every day there's a new crisis to deal with.\"",
      "Update: This story has been corrected to remove a reference to a massacre occurring at Great Sand Dunes National Monument. The massacre that was referenced took place at the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site."

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:55:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Aldrich Ames was a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Aldrich Ames, a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia, has died, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson.",
      "Ames, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died Monday at the age of 84 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.",
      "The 31-year veteran of the CIA is believed to have compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and sent a number of Soviet agents to their deaths or prison, as he traded information for large sums of money that funded his lavish lifestyle.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ames admitted that he compromised \"virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me\" as well as giving the Soviet Union and Russia a \"huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.\" Ames divulged the identities of 10 agents, and at least nine of them were executed, according to the Defense Department.",
      "There were a number of red flags throughout Ames' career \u2014 lie detector tests that showed deceptive answers, sudden unexplained wealth, poor job performance, alcohol abuse \u2014 but the CIA repeatedly missed or ignored the warning signs and promoted him to increasingly sensitive posts.",
      "Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, in 1941, Ames spent part of his childhood in Southeast Asia while his father worked for the CIA.",
      "After graduating high school and failing out of classes at the University of Chicago, Ames joined the CIA in 1962, performing clerical duties. At the same time, he attended George Washington University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history.",
      "In 1969, he married his first wife, who also worked for the CIA, and accepted his first assignment abroad in Ankara, Turkey, where he targeted Soviet spies for recruitment. But he was sent back to CIA headquarters in Virginia after three years when his job performance declined.",
      "Back in the U.S., Ames' problems with alcohol began to surface at work and his marriage fell apart.",
      "Ames went alone to his assignment in Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met his next wife, Rosario, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Colombian Embassy and a CIA asset, who would later be charged as his accomplice.",
      "Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase on a train in New York that contained classified materials that could have compromised a Soviet asset, and his superiors' concerns about his heavy drinking, Ames was promoted to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division.",
      "By then, financial pressure was building on Ames. The divorce from his first wife had left him in debt and he had new bills to pay once Rosario came to live with him.",
      "So, in 1985, he approached the Soviets, giving them the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. He later gave the KGB a list of CIA assets, dealing \"a crippling blow\" to the agency's Soviet operations, according to a 1994 Senate Intelligence Committee report. The KGB promised to give him more than $2 million for his cooperation. To tamp down suspicions about his newfound wealth, he told colleagues that Rosario came from a wealthy family.",
      "He continued spying for nine more years, including in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe and Czechoslovakia and worked for the CIA's counternarcotics center, traveling to meet his handlers in Vienna, Bogota and Caracas.",
      "Meanwhile, the CIA and FBI were looking for the source of the damaging compromises. In 1993, the mole hunt closed in on Ames. Investigators surveilled him for months, arresting him on Feb. 21, 1994, in Arlington, Virginia, days before he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow.",
      "Nearly two months later, Ames and his wife pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their espionage activities. Ames' wife was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "Then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey\u00a0said Ames was \"a malignant betrayer of his country who killed a number of people who helped the United States and the West win the Cold War.\" Those agents died, Woolsey said, because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar.\"",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0New York Times after his arrest, Ames explained his decision to start spying for the other side, saying money was the main motivator. But he also said the seed was planted when he regularly had lunch with a correspondent of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in the 1970s. The Soviet threat was not as great as the U.S made it out to be, he determined.",
      "\"I know what's damaging and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security,\" he told the New York Times. \"And I'm going to act on that.\"",

      "One of President Trump's rationales for ordering the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was his claim that Maduro was responsible for trafficking \"colossal amounts of deadly and illicit drugs\" into the United States, fueling the overdose deaths of \"countless Americans.\"",
      "But experts who study drug trafficking told CBS News these claims are exaggerated.",
      "Analysts from the U.S. government and independent think tanks say that Venezuela plays a relatively limited role in bringing cocaine to the U.S. and has virtually no link to the trafficking of fentanyl \u2014 the synthetic opioid that causes most overdose deaths.",
      "Venezuela is not listed as a source or a transit country for fentanyl in any edition of the Drug Enforcement Administration's annual \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" according to a review by Jeffrey Singer, a practicing surgeon and senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. Instead, the DEA has repeatedly found that fentanyl entering the U.S. is largely produced in Mexico \u2014 where it is often trafficked over land, primarily by U.S. citizens.",
      "\"I don't think what happened in Venezuela is going to in any way impact the overdose rates here, since the biggest driver of overdoses is fentanyl,\" Singer said.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, illegally manufactured fentanyl was involved in 65% of overdose deaths in 2024, compared to roughly 34% of overdose deaths that involved cocaine \u2013 figures that include overdoses involving multiple drugs. About 20% of overdose deaths in 2024 were caused by fentanyl alone, while 8.3% were caused by cocaine.",
      "The State Department has designated Venezuela as a major transit country for cocaine, which is primarily produced in Columbia. But much of the cocaine that moves through Venezuela is destined for Europe, rather than the United States, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies drug policy.",
      "\"A lot of cocaine that goes to the United States bypasses Venezuela,\" Felbab-Brown said. \"It goes through the Pacific, smuggled by sea from Columbia around Mexico to the U.S.\"",
      "Felbab-Brown also questioned Mr. Trump's portrayal of Maduro as an organizer and manager of the drug trade and cast doubt on the strength of the federal criminal case against him.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the prosecution in New York will be able to substantiate those charges,\" Felbab-Brown said. \"Certainly the more common perception is that Maduro was aware of members of the government taking a cut from drugs, but it's not widely believed that Maduro was a principal orchestrator.\"",

      "In a letter to House Democrats last week, Jeffries said the meeting was meant to highlight the pardons Mr. Trump granted to hundreds of rioters on his first day in office, some of whom have since been arrested on other charges involving guns, drugs and domestic abuse. Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said the hearing would also focus on \"ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration.\"",

      "Pamela Hemphill, the only riot defendant to reject Mr. Trump's pardon, testified at Tuesday's hearing alongside former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou and former Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon. Hemphill said she was \"deeply grateful for this chance to try to make amends and talk about what happened five years ago,\" adding that \"once I got away from the MAGA cult, and started educating myself about January the 6th, I knew what I did was wrong.\"",
      "\"I pleaded guilty to my crimes, because I did the crime,\" Hemphill said. \"Accepting that pardon would be lying about what happened on January the 6th. I am guilty, and I own that guilt.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and former Reps. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican, and Elaine Luria, a Democrat, were among the witnesses. All three served on the Jan. 6 committee, which issued four criminal referrals to the Justice Department against Mr. Trump.",
      "Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who pushed back against Mr. Trump's allegations of election fraud in his state, also testified. Duncan recalled Mr. Trump's pressure campaign to reject the election results in Georgia and the threats of violence he faced after he refused.",
      "\"At the time, I was a Republican. But there was no way I was going to illegally throw out millions of votes in our state,\" Duncan said. \"Make no mistake about it, it instantly put a target on my back.\"",
      "The former leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, and other Jan. 6 defendants held a march marking the day's events. Tarrio said the event was in honor of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer while the Jan. 6 mob tried to breach the Speaker's Lobby outside the House chamber.",
      "Tarrio was among those who received clemency from Mr. Trump. He was convicted of seditious conspiracy and other charges and sentenced to 22 years in prison.",

      "Gov. Tim Walz, addressing the media's questions for the first time since he announced he was dropping his bid to be reelected to a third term, lashed out at the Trump administration and claimed the state was \"under attack\" by the federal government.",
      "Walz added that he believes Minnesota is \"under assault like no other time in our state's history because of a petty, vile administration that doesn't care about the well-being of Minnesotans.\"",
      "The comments come amid a surge in Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area, as the agency escalates its federal crackdown amid a\u00a0widening fraud scandal\u00a0in Minnesota. The current plans involve a 30-day surge in the area, and may represent one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. As many as 2,000 federal agents may be involved in the surge, though the department told WCCO on Tuesday, \"For the safety of our officers we do not get into law enforcement footprint.\"",
      "Walz on Tuesday afternoon accused the GOP of wanting \"to tear this state down.\" He also called the renewed federal immigration and fraud crackdown a \"ridiculous surge\" that has not been coordinated with the state. He also called it a \"show\" for the cameras.",
      "\"I don't think any governor in history has had to fight a war against the federal government every single day,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump posted on the\u00a0social media platform Truth Social\u00a0on Monday afternoon about Walz's decision to drop out of the race. He said, without providing evidence, \"Minnesota's Corrupt Governor will possibly leave office before his Term is up but, in any event, will not be running again because he was caught, REDHANDED, along with Ilhan Omar, and others of his Somali friends, stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration plans to halt billions of dollars in federal funding for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud, a Department of Health and Human Services official said Tuesday.",
      "The move will freeze $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants that largely benefit children. The states affected are Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "The New York Post was first to report that HHS would withhold the funding.",
      "\"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"",
      "The Illinois Department of Human Services said it has not yet received any notification or communication about impacts to its federal funding.",
      "\"This is yet another politically-motivated action by the Trump Administration that confuses families and leaves states with more questions than answers. IDHS will provide an update if it is made aware of program or funding changes,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration comes after HHS announced last week that it froze federal child care funding for Minnesota because of \"blatant fraud\" in public-assistance programs.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered \"large-scale fraud\" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",
      "CBS News visited several of the centers named by Shirley and found that all but two of the facilities have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "President Trump has criticized Minnesota leaders for its handling of the scandal and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked California, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, as \"more corrupt\" than Minnesota. He said Tuesday in a Truth Social post that \"the fraud investigation of California has begun.\" The president has not provided evidence of wide-scale fraud in California social services and did not provide further details about a probe involving the state.",
      "Beyond Minnesota, the Trump administration has also not put forth evidence of sweeping fraud schemes in social services in New York, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "Still, over the past several months the Trump administration has turned off the spigot of funding to Democrat-led states and cities, particularly during the historic government shutdown last year. Mr. Trump paused billions of dollars for infrastructure and climate projects, and slashed disaster preparedness grants.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of playing politics with money that has been approved by Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Five years after the historic and damaging attack on the U.S. Capitol, millions of dollars in damages have been repaired and clean-up has long been completed. Many of the physical injuries have healed. And President Trump's pardons ended the largest criminal prosecution in American history, while freeing more than 1,500 defendants from criminal liability.",
      "What remains is a poisonous and lingering resentment over the riot and an ongoing battle to preserve the basic facts of what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The president and some of his supporters have accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Department of Justice against Jan. 6 defendants. In the process, Mr. Trump and surrogates have espoused arguments that are inconsistent with the facts of the cases, the timeline of events and public statistics from the Capitol siege prosecutions.",
      "In a letter to colleagues last week, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced a public meeting, with witness testimony, is being held Tuesday to rebut claims about Jan. 6. Jeffries's letter said the meeting would \"expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President's first day in office.\"",
      "Dan Hodges, a local Washington, D.C., police officer who was injured by the attack of the mob, said he is frustrated by an ongoing \"rewriting\" of the history of Jan. 6.",
      "\"Five years ago I thought: This has to be the most videotaped crime in American history. It's just so much evidence. There's no way anyone can possibly deny what occurred here,\" Hodges said in an interview. \"But that's exactly what's happening.\"",
      "Hodges, who spoke with CBS News as a citizen, separate from his ongoing role as a police officer, also said, \"The attack was everything it appeared to be on television.\"",
      "Mr. Trump himself \u2014 who has referred to Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages\" for years \u2014 attempted to reframe or rewrite some of the key issues of the Jan. 6 prosecutions in the hours and days after issuing the pardons. He has claimed many defendants were actually innocent, were only responsible for \"minor\" infractions or were held in unfairly harsh conditions.",
      "At a January 2025 news conference, Mr. Trump said: \"These people have already served years in prison, and they've served them viciously.\" He also claimed Jan 6 rioters had \"served years in jail,\" then added that \"murderers don't even go to jail in this country.\"",
      "His statements excluded the more than 1,000 Jan 6 riot defendants who did not serve years in custody, and the hundreds of pardoned Capitol riot defendants who had not yet gone on trial or who served prison terms for cases in which they pleaded guilty.",
      "Mr. Trump also defended his acts of clemency during the same press conference by saying: \"It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing.\"",
      "The president did not specify which prison to which he was referring. The imprisoned Jan. 6 riot defendants served time in a wide range of federal prison facilities nationwide, all of which are operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Those include prisons in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, California, Arizona, Ohio, Michigan and Florida, none of which has been singled out as \"inhumane\" by the prison bureau, which Trump now oversees.",
      "Although the local Washington, D.C., jail received criticism for its conditions in 2021 and 2022, when some Jan. 6 defendants were temporarily held there, the jail is not a prison. Nor was the jail used for those who were sentenced to federal prison terms.",
      "In a Fox News interview just days after returning to office, Mr. Trump justified his pardons by arguing, \"most of the people were absolutely innocent,\" which runs counter to many defendants' decision to plead guilty and admit to crimes. His statement is also belied by the perfect trial record secured by prosecutors, who obtained convictions in 100% of the jury trials held for Jan. 6 defendants who pleaded not guilty.",
      "During that interview, Mr. Trump also defended his pardoning of violent rioters who assaulted police, saying: \"They were very minor incidents.\"",
      "According to court records reviewed by CBS News, the injuries to police included violent assaults with a series of makeshift weapons, including bats, poles, bear spray, sticks, chemicals and fists. Around 140 police officers were injured, with some facing cracked ribs, smashed spinal disks and brain injuries, according to the union representing Capitol Police officers. Multiple police officers also died by suicide in the weeks after the siege.",
      "In an October 2025 social media post, Mr. Trump claimed the Biden administration had placed 274 FBI agents among the crowd at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, even though Biden had not yet been sworn in as president. Baseless claims that the riot was orchestrated by the FBI have circulated for years, though Trump-nominated FBI Director Kash Patel has said the 274 agents were deployed to the Capitol for \"crowd control.\"",
      "Some riot defendants have characterized the prosecutions as \"weaponization\" of the federal government by the Justice Department. Others have used the term \"staged,\" \"fake\" or \"fed-surrection\" to allege that the violent riot did not happen as it appeared to on live television across America.",
      "\"Are we not supposed to believe what we saw with our own eyes?,\" asked Rep. Bennie Thompson, a longtime House Democrat from Mississippi who chaired the former House January 6th Select Committee, which aimed to dispel myths and fake claims about the riot. \"We have to keep repeating it, because these individuals with larger microphones keep calling it 'fake news.'\"",
      "The White House declined to comment on remarks Mr. Trump has made about Jan. 6 or those involved, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement:\u00a0 \"The media's continued obsession with January 6 is one of the many reasons trust in the press is at historic lows \u2014 they aren't covering issues that the American people actually care about. President Trump was resoundingly reelected to enact an agenda based on securing the border, driving down crime, and restarting our economy \u2014 the President is delivering.\"",
      "House Democrats are expected to call a number of the police victims of the siege as public witnesses at their Tuesday public meeting. Several congressional staffers familiar with the matter told CBS News they expect Democrats to issue public statements Monday and Tuesday to reinforce the facts of the Jan. 6 siege, amid Mr. Trump's claims minimizing the riot.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' planned public meeting or about plans for any formal events to mark the siege.",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, called Hodges to testify at an October 2025 hearing on political violence. Welch said he wanted the officer's testimony to be public to dispel false narratives about Jan. 6. Several conservatives also testified at the hearing, during which Republican lawmakers highlighted acts of political violence and threats against Mr. Trump and other right-leaning public figures.",
      "\"There's a process to rewrite what happened on January 6 and essentially erase it,\" Welch told CBS News. \"And that's wrong. They're literally in the process of re-writing it.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who previously chaired a Senate committee that conducted a bipartisan investigation into security failures on Jan. 6, told CBS News, \"Congress and Vice President Pence did our job that day: democracy prevailed.\"",
      "\"While we have come together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our electoral process, the President's pardons and attempts to rewrite history are an insult to law enforcement and undermine our democracy,\" Klobuchar said.",

    "summary": "The new CDC recommendations suggest reducing the number of vaccinations all children should receive.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on Monday announced updated recommendations for childhood vaccines with some significant changes. The new guidelines recommend fewer shots and are likely to face pushback from many doctors and public health experts.",
      "Under the new guidelines, the CDC recommends all children be vaccinated against 11 diseases, a decrease from the 17 immunizations previously recommended.",
      "The vaccines recommended under the new guidelines include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)",
      "In a second category under the new guidelines, it's recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.",
      "Finally, in a third category, for children not in high-risk groups, the decision on whether to receive certain vaccines should be based on \"shared clinical decision-making\" between physicians and parents, according to the CDC. Those immunizations include COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.",
      "\"It's very complicated to try to figure out the risks and the benefits,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on the \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It's so important to have a health care provider with whom you can discuss this openly and empathetically.\"",
      "He noted, \"The American Academy of Pediatrics calls today's recommendations dangerous and said they're going to continue to give their own recommendations.\"",
      "The changes follow a controversial December recommendation on when children should receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been hand-picked by Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.\"",
      "\"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,\" he said.",
      "President Trump called the updates \"a far more reasonable schedule, where all children will only be recommended to receive vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases.\" But parents could still choose to give their children other vaccinations and those will still be covered by insurance, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The assessment compared the U.S. vaccine schedule to those of 20 other developed nations and found that the U.S. is a \"global outlier\" in both the number of diseases addressed and total number of recommended doses, according to the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0has disputed that, saying the longstanding U.S. recommendations were based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called Monday's announcement a \"reckless step.\"",
      "\"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,\" he said in a statement. The biggest\u00a0measles outbreak\u00a0in more than 30 years has sickened more than 2,000 people across the U.S. Most of those sickened were not vaccinated, and two children died.",
      "Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, warned that the change in the CDC's vaccine recommendations will put children at risk.",
      "\"Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\" Osterholm told The Associated Press.",

      "Speaking to sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Roughly 200 Americans carried out the overnight raid Saturday at Maduro's residence in downtown Caracas, Hegseth said. Fighter jets and bombers struck Venezuelan air defenses, clearing the way for Delta Force commandos to close in on the compound, where they came under heavy fire.",
      "\"They got off the helicopter, and the bullets were flying all over the place,\" President Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. \"As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back.\"",
      "Several U.S. soldiers were injured in the operation, according to U.S. officials. Dozens of Venezuelans were killed, along with 32 Cuban citizens who were part of Maduro's security detail, Cuba's government said.",
      "\"There was a lot of death on the other side, unfortunately. But a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday trying to protect him,\" Trump said.",
      "Once U.S. forces breached the compound, they intercepted Maduro before he could reach a safe room, officials said. The raid had been rehearsed for months using a replica of Maduro's residence to prepare for multiple scenarios.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation was built around repetition and redundancy.",

    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them.

      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",

Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",

Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts. A Daily Mail article from 2023 reported that the photo shows Saddam Hussein after his capture, sitting with a Delta Force member, but CBS has not independently confirmed this.",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",

Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",

    "summary": "Two U.S. intelligence officials said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing Soviet-era defense systems and armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 American forces planned to intercept an evading oil tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans told CBS News Monday.",
      "Two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News Tuesday that Russia had sent a submarine and other Russian naval vessels to escort the tanker Marinera, which sails under a Russian flag. The Wall Street Journal was first to\u00a0report\u00a0on the escort.",
      "It is unclear where the U.S. plans stood now that Russian naval assets had been dispatched. It is not uncommon for military operations to be shelved entirely.",
      "Since last month, U.S. forces have pursued the Marinera, a crude oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1, as the U.S. continues its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Since September, the United States has steadily turned the screws, accusing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government of using multiple vessels to move drugs north toward American shores.",
      "Two U.S. intelligence officials also said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes \u2014 as well as portable Soviet-era air defense systems. The discussions took place before the capture of Maduro and his wife by U.S. special forces on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday morning, the officials told CBS News.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and said the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker last month, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official previously said.",
      "Maduro has rejected the U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and instead accuses the United States of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement. The latest confrontation is one in a series of U.S. actions that include charging Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism. American strikes on multiple vessels have killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "The Marinera was a ship previously flagged out of Panama and was sanctioned for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading by the Treasury Department in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. But now the ship is sailing under the Russian flag, which potentially could complicate sensitive talks between the United States and Russia over ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Monday, no reply was returned from the White House, Pentagon or State Department. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The two U.S. officials with knowledge of U.S. military operational planning had said Monday the interdiction mission could come as early as this week, but like any Defense Department plans, the operation could ultimately be shelved. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "Like the Marinera, The Skipper was also sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "Ships like the Marinera, The Skipper and the Centuries, another oil tanker the United States seized last month, are all a part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "President Trump unilaterally imposed a \"total and complete blockade\" on already sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "On Monday, The New York Times reported that at least 16 oil tankers have attempted to evade the U.S. naval blockade by disguising their geographical locations or turning off their transmission beacons.",
      "If the Marinera is captured by American forces, it would be the third oil tanker seized by the United States since it began its campaign against Venezuela in early September.",

      "Special prosecutor Bill Turner became emotional laying out Gonzales' alleged in action during opening statements to the jury on Tuesday, pointing out that others, including teachers, tried to protect children from the shooter.",
      "\"When a child is in danger and calls 911, we have the right to expect a response,\" Turner said.",
      "An investigation found that 77 minutes passed from the time authorities arrived until the tactical team breached the classroom and killed the 18-year-old shooter, who was obsessed with violence and notoriety in the months leading up to the shooting.",
      "Defense attorney Nico Lahood told the jury Gonzales was not in a position to see the shooter that morning, and was relaying information to other officers as they arrived.",
      "\"The government wants to make it seem like he just sat there. He didn't just sit there. He did what he could with what he knew at the time in what was a dynamic situation,\" Lahood said.",
      "At the request of Gonzales' attorneys, the trial was moved to Corpus Christi after they argued Gonzales could not receive a fair trial in Uvalde.",
      "The indictment accuses Gonzales of putting children in \"imminent danger\" of injury or death by failing to engage the shooter and by not following his training.\u00a0 He faces 29 counts of child abandonment or endangerment.",
      "State and federal reviews of the shooting cited cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology.",

      "Amid an ongoing fraud scandal in Minnesota and a nationwide immigration crackdown, President Trump has recently taken aim at Somali immigrants, describing them in disparaging terms and saying they're \"ripping off our country.\" Asked about Mr. Trump's comments and whether legal Somali immigrants should be worried, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS News in an exclusive interview, \"I'm focused on policing the streets, not policing President Trump's words.\"",

      "Asked how she justified the expense to the taxpayers of sending that many agents in, Noem said, \"The American taxpayer is grateful that that resource allocation has been put here. We've never seen this kind of fraudulence and abuse of programs before in recent history.\"",
      "Over the past three years, prosecutors in the area have charged more than 90 people with fraud,\u00a078 of whom were arrested in connection with a fraud scheme involving a nonprofit called\u00a0Feeding Our Future, which was supposed to help feed vulnerable children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A CBS News review of those centers found dozens of citations related to safety, cleanliness, equipment and staff training, among other violations, but there was no recorded evidence of fraud.",

      "A U.S. Marine who was held captive in Venezuela for two years under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's regime recalled on Tuesday being handcuffed and electrocuted after he says he was wrongfully detained.",
      "Matthew Heath, a corporal in the Corps from 1999 until 2003, says Maduro detained Americans to be used as \"trading chips\" and a policy tool, telling CBS News' Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" that he was\u00a0arrested by Venezuelan authorities in September 2020\u00a0after showing Venezuelan authorities his passport at a regular checkpoint.",
      "\"I was placed in their holding facility called Casa de los Sue\u00f1os, the House of Dreams,\" Heath said. \"I can assure you it does not live up to its name.\"",
      "There are at least four detained Americans being held in Venezuela, according to a hostage advocate familiar with the situation. Health says they're under \"terrible treatment\" without access to clean drinking water or medical facility and recounted his own experience.",
      "\"I was tortured. They handcuffed me to the frame of metal bed and electrocuted me with a car battery and jumper cables,\" he told CBS News. \"It's not exactly polite conversation but I can tell you that's just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "Health was accused of entering Venezuela illegally, the prosecutor said, claiming that he didn't have a passport but rather had a copy of it hidden in one of his shoes. Three Venezuelan nationals were also accused of conspiring with Heath.",
      "The Venezuelan government also accused him of being a spy and charged him in an alleged terrorist plot to sabotage oil refineries and electrical service in order to stir unrest.",
      "The Marine was\u00a0released in October 2022 along with six other Americans imprisoned in the South American country in exchange for the release of two nephews of Maduro's wife who had been jailed for years by the U.S. on drug smuggling convictions. Their release came after senior U.S. government officials traveled to Caracas that summer in a bid to bring home detained Americans. The trip also followed a public plea from Heath's family to the Biden administration to take urgent action to save his life following what they said was a suicide attempt.",
      "When asked whether he wants President Trump to publicly call on the interim president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, to released the detainees, Health said it would likely help the moral of their family members \u2014 but added that Mr. Trump can do more.",

    "summary": "Aldrich Ames was a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Aldrich Ames, a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia, has died, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson.",
      "Ames, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died Monday at the age of 84 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.",
      "The 31-year veteran of the CIA is believed to have compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and sent a number of Soviet agents to their deaths or prison, as he traded information for large sums of money that funded his lavish lifestyle.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ames admitted that he compromised \"virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me\" as well as giving the Soviet Union and Russia a \"huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.\" Ames divulged the identities of 10 agents, and at least nine of them were executed, according to the Defense Department.",
      "There were a number of red flags throughout Ames' career \u2014 lie detector tests that showed deceptive answers, sudden unexplained wealth, poor job performance, alcohol abuse \u2014 but the CIA repeatedly missed or ignored the warning signs and promoted him to increasingly sensitive posts.",
      "Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, in 1941, Ames spent part of his childhood in Southeast Asia while his father worked for the CIA.",
      "After graduating high school and failing out of classes at the University of Chicago, Ames joined the CIA in 1962, performing clerical duties. At the same time, he attended George Washington University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history.",
      "In 1969, he married his first wife, who also worked for the CIA, and accepted his first assignment abroad in Ankara, Turkey, where he targeted Soviet spies for recruitment. But he was sent back to CIA headquarters in Virginia after three years when his job performance declined.",
      "Back in the U.S., Ames' problems with alcohol began to surface at work and his marriage fell apart.",
      "Ames went alone to his assignment in Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met his next wife, Rosario, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Colombian Embassy and a CIA asset, who would later be charged as his accomplice.",
      "Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase on a train in New York that contained classified materials that could have compromised a Soviet asset, and his superiors' concerns about his heavy drinking, Ames was promoted to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division.",
      "By then, financial pressure was building on Ames. The divorce from his first wife had left him in debt and he had new bills to pay once Rosario came to live with him.",
      "So, in 1985, he approached the Soviets, giving them the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. He later gave the KGB a list of CIA assets, dealing \"a crippling blow\" to the agency's Soviet operations, according to a 1994 Senate Intelligence Committee report. The KGB promised to give him more than $2 million for his cooperation. To tamp down suspicions about his newfound wealth, he told colleagues that Rosario came from a wealthy family.",
      "He continued spying for nine more years, including in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe and Czechoslovakia and worked for the CIA's counternarcotics center, traveling to meet his handlers in Vienna, Bogota and Caracas.",
      "Meanwhile, the CIA and FBI were looking for the source of the damaging compromises. In 1993, the mole hunt closed in on Ames. Investigators surveilled him for months, arresting him on Feb. 21, 1994, in Arlington, Virginia, days before he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow.",
      "Nearly two months later, Ames and his wife pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their espionage activities. Ames' wife was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "Then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey\u00a0said Ames was \"a malignant betrayer of his country who killed a number of people who helped the United States and the West win the Cold War.\" Those agents died, Woolsey said, because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar.\"",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0New York Times after his arrest, Ames explained his decision to start spying for the other side, saying money was the main motivator. But he also said the seed was planted when he regularly had lunch with a correspondent of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in the 1970s. The Soviet threat was not as great as the U.S made it out to be, he determined.",
      "\"I know what's damaging and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security,\" he told the New York Times. \"And I'm going to act on that.\"",

      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew.

      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards.

    "summary": "Beloved schoolteacher Mary Catherine Edwards was found murdered wearing police-grade Smith & Wesson handcuffs \u2014 sending ripples through the Beaumont, Texas, Police Department.",
    "story": [
      "On Jan. 14, 1995, Mary Catherine Edwards, 31, a beloved elementary school teacher, was found dead in her townhouse in Beaumont, Texas.",
      "Her parents found her. It was a terrible scene: she was in her bathtub, handcuffed, and had been sexually assaulted. There were no signs of forced entry, which made investigators think she must know her killer. The police-grade Smith & Wesson handcuffs were always a big clue, but when detectives tried tracing the serial numbers, they came up empty. Early investigators questioned various law enforcement officers and came up with nothing either.",
      "The case went cold,\u00a0 \u00a0but as Beaumont Police Det. Aaron Lewallen told \"48 Hours contributor Natalie Morales, \"Could it have been someone that we knew?... It was almost like a ghost story told around the camp fire \u2026\"\u00a0 Morales reports on the search for answers in an encore of \u00a0\"Tracking the Killer of Mary Catherine Edwards,\"\u00a0airing Saturday, Jan 10 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Thanks to carefully preserved DNA from the crime scene and the advent of genetic genealogy, Det. Aaron Lewallen, his wife Tina Lewallen, also a detective \u2014 along with Brandon Bess, a Texas Ranger in the cold case division, and Shera LaPoint, a professional genealogist \u2014 spent almost three months working together in a nonstop push to finally solve the case.",
      "After all the early leads and the suspicion that someone in law enforcement had been involved, the family tree they constructed revealed someone else. Their chief suspect turned out to be not a law enforcement officer, but a man who went to the same high school as Edwards: Clayton Foreman.",
      "And then they learned that Edwards and her identical twin sister Allison had been bridesmaids in Foreman's first wedding. The sisters were good friends with his first wife, Dianna Coe, who also went to the same high school.",
      "Coe remembers them fondly, telling Morales how kind they were to her when she moved to a new town and started a new school.",
      "\"I was new to the area \u2026 so, I knew no one. And they \u2026 just started talking to me and asked me my name \u00a0\u2026 and we were friends from that point forward,\" Coe said.",
      "The sisters were the first people Coe thought of to be bridesmaids at her wedding. She and Foreman stayed married for 11 years. They were divorced by the time of the murder, but in hindsight, Coe began to see things in a different, darker, light. She remembered her ex-husband's fascination with the police officers and their tools of the trade, like handcuffs and billy clubs. As Coe told Morales, \"He had a billy club that he kept\u2026by the bed. You know, said it was for protection. And I remember that he had ordered those handcuffs ... Well, he had them hung over the rearview mirror.\"",
      "Coe also remembered a disturbing conversation with her ex-husband when she heard Edwards had been murdered and called to talk about it.",
      "\"I think I was, you know, crying and I said, 'oh, my God,' I said, 'somebody has murdered Catherine,\" Coe told \"48 Hours.\" \"And \u2014 and he goes, 'Oh, really?' Just like no emotion, which I thought that was odd.\"",
      "A DNA match quickly established that Foreman had indeed been at the crime scene. And when Det. Aaron Lewallen and Ranger Bess went to question Foreman, they had an arrest warrant. They also brought something with them \u2014 something very symbolic.",
      "Together, they had taken the time to work out an arrangement with the prosecutors so they could use the handcuffs taken as evidence at the crime scene. When they arrested Foreman for the murder of Edwards, they did so with the very handcuffs that had bound her the night she died. He wasn't one of them, but in the course of the investigation, they learned Foreman had been falsely claiming to be a police officer.",
      "The handcuffs \u2014 such a focus in the beginning \u2014 came full circle at the end. Bess will never forget how it felt. As he told Morales, \"It's a moment I'll never forget ... you feel like you got to do something for Catherine there ... You know, like physically got to do for her, is take those cuffs that bound her when she was murdered and put them back on the guy that murdered her ... It may seem small to some, but it was a really big deal to us, and it felt good.\"",
      "The jury in Foreman's murder trial deliberated for less than an hour before finding him guilty of the murder of Edwards. Foreman was sentenced to life in prison.",

      "Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" contributor: Were they \u2026 police-grade handcuffs?",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: Yeah. \u2026 Handcuffs have always been a key piece of this.",
      "Jan. 14, 1995. It was a Saturday. Catherine, as most people called her, didn't show up for a family lunch and she wasn't answering her phone. When her mother and father went to check on her, they had to see what no parent ever should.",

      "Heleniah Adams: I just remember being told that our teacher wouldn't make it to class that day \u2026 Everyone just crying.",
      "Dianna Coe: My mom is the one that told me \u2026 And so she said, \"have you not heard about Catherine?\" \u2026 and I go, \"my Catherine?\"",

      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Ranger Bess approached me \u2026 and he asked if I thought we had a case that would fit the bill for that type of investigation. I said, \"absolutely. I know the perfect case for this.\" And it was the Catherine Edwards case.",
      "So, in April 2020, the DNA from Catherine Edwards' crime scene went to Othram, a lab outside of Houston, for testing.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: There, they would give us familial matches. And from there, we would start trying to build a family tree to get us closer to our suspect.",
      "But the number of names to pursue was overwhelming.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: When the family tree began to grow beyond my computer screen, (laughs) I started to get a little bit confused. And that's when \u2026 Tina jumped on board.",
      "Det. Aaron's Lewallen's wife, Tina Lewallen, an auto crimes detective, began using her off hours to help sort through it.",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: The matches were all Cajun.",

      "Natalie Morales: Specifically.",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: \u2026 particularly Kaplan, Louisiana.",
      "So Det. Tina Lewallen went back to Catherine's journals looking for clues.",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: \u2026 to see if I could see a Cajun name that jumped out to me. \u2026 I did find a few French names and they were quickly eliminated and nowhere in our tree.",
      "And as she was building out the branches, one of the names on the family tree kept coming up: LaPoint.",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: I'm researching the matches and building my trees and you're researching other people's trees \u2026 I kept noticing Shera LaPoint \u2014 had built that tree, and then I'm working some more, I do some more research. Well, Shera LaPoint built this tree. And I'm like, is she related to our suspect? \u2026 I had no idea who she was.",
      "And when they called her, they found out LaPoint had been building her family tree.",
      "Shera LaPoint: It was my family's DNA kits that I had uploaded to GEDmatch.",
      "And then they found out something that changed the course of the investigation. LaPoint was known professionally as \"The Gene Hunter\" and already skilled at working these cases.\u00a0 She'd identified one of the women buried along Interstate Highway 45 in the Texas killing fields case.",
      "And she agreed to lend her expertise.",
      "Shera LaPoint: I told him that I was willing to help.",

      "Shera LaPoint: It was kind of scary because I'm putting my own second cousins in this tree and I'm thinking, oh my gosh, you know, could one of my grandfather's sister's grandchildren have \u2014 have done this, they lived here in Texas.",
      "It was a complicated, multilayered process using publicly available DNA, birth and death records \u2014 finding parents, siblings and cousins.",
      "Shera LaPoint: As you build those trees, you look for information that \u2026 is pertinent to the case that you're working on. We had a tag for people who were in Beaumont \u2026 She was a teacher. As you build tree, you look at people who are in education.",
      "The tree grew up and down and sideways \u2013 there were almost 7,500 names.",
      "Shera LaPoint: That's a lot of hours, a lot of work and a lot of people in a family tree.",
      "All the while, Det. Tina Lewallen hardly slept, working through most nights \u2014 knowing there was a killer still out there.",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: Every day counted; every day mattered \u2026 I needed to get it solved.",

      "Natalie Morales: Best buds.",
      "Shera LaPoint: Best buds. I don't know what else to say.",
      "And when they needed DNA, they turned to Det. Tina Lewallen's husband, Det. Aaron Lewallen, and Texas Ranger Brandon Bess.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: So, from that point, me and Brandon Bess would drive around Texas and go talk to these people.",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: Convincing someone \u2026 to give their DNA up, to give a piece of themselves up to you in a homicide investigation can be very difficult.",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: When we would sense, um, anxiety in someone, Aaron would immediately tell them, \"hey, who do you want to play you in the movie ...\"",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: And they would look at Aaron like he was crazy \u2026 and say, (laughs) um, \"what are you talking about.\" \"Well, this guy's a Texas Ranger, everything they do turns into a movie. Who do you want to play your role in this movie?\" (laughs) That calmed them down every time \u2026 and I of course threw out there, \"hey, I've already got Brad Pitt. So, you know, you can't \u2014 you can't be Brad \u2013 cause Brad's playing me.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there ever a time though that somebody actually thought \u2026 my uncle may actually be a killer. Who knows?",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: In every one of these cases that I've worked using DNA and genetic genealogy, you have at least one person, usually two or three that says, you know what, I had that weird Uncle Joe \u2026",
      "Once the uploads were compared to the killer's DNA, if the amount of shared genetic material was low, they knew it was a dead end.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Cause there were times when we would come across a name and I'm like \u2014 you get that that butterflies in your stomach \u2026 \u00a0like, \"hey, maybe this is our guy\" \u2026 And then \u2026 turns out it's not our guy.",
      "After almost three month of ups and down and nearly nonstop work, LaPoint hit paydirt.",
      "Shera LaPoint: It was about 10:30 at night.",
      "She was working a family line very distantly related to her own.",
      "Shera LaPoint: It was a very common Cajun name, Thibodeaux. \u2026 I got to a couple who were in Beaumont \u2026 I was able to see from, uh, records that they had two sons.",
      "This was a major lead: a family, in Catherine's town, with two sons who went to Forest Park High \u2013 the same school Catherine did \u2014 at around the same time.",
      "Shera LaPoint: I put the names in the tree and I messaged Tina and I said, um, \"there's a couple in Beaumont.\"",
      "Shera LaPoint: I'm tired, I'm going to bed. And I turned my cellphone off and I fell asleep on the sofa \u2026 and when I woke up the next morning, my phone had just blown up.",
      "Natalie Morales: And it was you on the other end?",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: Yes.",
      "Natalie Morales: What were you saying?",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: This is them. We found them. Just didn't know which one.",
      "Natalie Morales: OK \u2026 it's either Michael Foreman or Clayton Foreman. What did you do to \u2014 to figure that out?",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: The first name I ran was Clayton \u2026 And when I came across his prior conviction for the sexual assault, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I'm like, \"this is our guy.\"",
      "In 1981, a 19-year-old woman told police that Clayton Foreman bound her hands and raped her.\u00a0 She had also gone to Forest Park High School where Clayton was the manager of the football team. Clayton Foreman was convicted but was given probation and paid a fine.",
      "Natalie Morales: But he did not have to give a DNA sample at that time.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: No. This was back in the early '80s. We didn't have sex offender registry, uh, no DNA database.",
      "And then they found another connection: it went all way back to Dianna Coe, Catherine's friend from middle school.",
      "In high school, Coe fell madly in love. Her boyfriend had graduated three years ahead of her, and they got engaged.",
      "Dianna Coe: He was so kind. \u2026 He had the most wonderful personality.",
      "And when she started planning her wedding, she immediately turned to her old friends Catherine and Allison.",
      "Dianna Coe: And they were one of the first ones I thought of as, uh, bridesmaid and \u2014 and I asked them and they said yes.",
      "And the groom? The man Coe married back in 1982? Now he was their number one suspect: Clayton Foreman.",
      "Natalie Morales: She in fact did know him.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Yes.",
      "In hindsight, there were signs. When Coe found out about Clayton Foreman's legal troubles, the wedding was less than three months away.",
      "Dianna Coe: \u2026 and \u2026 the wedding invitations had already been mailed out.",
      "Dianna Coe: And I said, \"rape?\" I said, \"oh, there's no way.\"",
      "But she never got any details and her fianc\u00e9 explained it away.",
      "Dianna Coe: \u2026 he kept telling me, it \u2014 it was a big misunderstanding \u2026 And so in my mind, I thought, well, he must be telling the truth because if he got arrested, he's not in jail.",
      "Natalie Morales: But you didn't really believe it was rape?",
      "Dianna Coe: Right.",
      "Coe's sister, Anne Anderson, and her brother, Scooter Daleo, were not so sure and neither were their parents who wanted her to call it off.",
      "Scooter Daleo: And I said, well, \"Dianna, why don't you just wait?\" \u2026 And she didn't wanna wait. She wanted to marry Clay. She was in love with him.",
      "Anne Anderson: \u2026 she's believing him and she's wanting to get married, then \u2014 then we have to support as a family.",
      "Dianna Coe: And he was like, I'm so, so sorry. \u2026 I love you. I want us to be married. I want us to have a family. \u2026 And so, I was like, OK, you know. So I went \u2014 I went through with it.",
      "Dianna and Clayton Foreman stayed married for a little more than 11 years and they had a son. The relationship began to fray over Foreman lying about their finances and it ended after he had an affair. And looking back, Coe can see that he had an unhealthy fascination with police officers and the tools of their trade \u2014 like handcuffs.",
      "Dianna Coe: I remember that he had ordered those handcuffs. \u2026 Well, he had 'em hung over the rearview mirror \u2026 And I \u2014 I didn't think anything of it.",
      "When Catherine was killed, they were divorced, but Coe remembers calling her ex-husband to talk about it.",
      "Dianna Coe: I think I was, you know, crying and I said, \"oh, my God,\" I said, \"somebody has murdered Catherine.\" And \u2014 and he goes,\" oh, really?\" Just like no emotion \u2026 When we hung the phone up, I can remember 'cause I was like kind of squinting and kind of like going, God, that's kind of odd.",
      "With all the mounting evidence, Foreman needed to be found. He was 60 and no longer living in Beaumont. They quickly tracked him to Reynoldsberg, Ohio.",
      "Natalie Morales: What was he doing there?",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: He was an Uber driver at the time. \u2026 I was able to send a lead, uh, to a field office up there \u2026 and basically did what we call a trash run.",
      "Natalie Morales: You need to collect a piece of DNA so that you can ensure that it's the \u2014 the right guy, right?",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Correct. Uh, so, that's what they did. \u2026 They surveilled his house \u2026 and then went and snatched a bag of trash \u2026 and sent it to me.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Uh, so, I brought that stuff to Houston, to the DPS crime lab. And from there they tested it.",
      "The likelihood that the DNA belonged to Clayton Foreman was a big number \u2014 461 septillion. It doesn't get better than that, says LaPoint.",
      "Shera LaPoint: I mean, you can't fight those odds. You cannot fight those odds.",
      "And that was all they needed.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: And I got a text from a \u2014 a DPS lab technician. And she said, \"go get his ass.\"",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen and Ranger Bess were about to hop a plane to Ohio, ready to face the man they felt sure had killed Catherine.",
      "And while they're doing that, Det. Tina Lewallen pays a visit to Coe.",

      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flights-cancelled-venezuela-travel-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:36:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",

      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration plans to halt billions of dollars in federal funding for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud, a Department of Health and Human Services official said Tuesday.",
      "The move will freeze $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants that largely benefit children. The states affected are Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "The New York Post was first to report that HHS would withhold the funding.",
      "\"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"",
      "The Illinois Department of Human Services said it has not yet received any notification or communication about impacts to its federal funding.",
      "\"This is yet another politically-motivated action by the Trump Administration that confuses families and leaves states with more questions than answers. IDHS will provide an update if it is made aware of program or funding changes,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration comes after HHS announced last week that it froze federal child care funding for Minnesota because of \"blatant fraud\" in public-assistance programs.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered \"large-scale fraud\" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",
      "CBS News visited several of the centers named by Shirley and found that all but two of the facilities have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "President Trump has criticized Minnesota leaders for its handling of the scandal and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked California, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, as \"more corrupt\" than Minnesota. He said Tuesday in a Truth Social post that \"the fraud investigation of California has begun.\" The president has not provided evidence of wide-scale fraud in California social services and did not provide further details about a probe involving the state.",
      "Beyond Minnesota, the Trump administration has also not put forth evidence of sweeping fraud schemes in social services in New York, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "Still, over the past several months the Trump administration has turned off the spigot of funding to Democrat-led states and cities, particularly during the historic government shutdown last year.

LaMalfa died during the surgical procedure, the sheriff's department said, and the coroner's unit is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of death.",
      "\"Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,\" Majority Whip Tom Emmer said in a post on X. \"Our prayers are with Doug's wife, Jill, and their children.\"",
      "Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan, the chair of the House Republican Conference, said LaMalfa \"cared deeply about his constituents and worked tirelessly to represent their voices, values, and livelihoods in Congress.\"",

    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-announces-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/",
    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 20:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The new CDC recommendations suggest reducing the number of vaccinations all children should receive.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on Monday announced updated recommendations for childhood vaccines with some significant changes. The new guidelines recommend fewer shots and are likely to face pushback from many doctors and public health experts.",
      "Under the new guidelines, the CDC recommends all children be vaccinated against 11 diseases, a decrease from the 17 immunizations previously recommended.",
      "The vaccines recommended under the new guidelines include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)",
      "In a second category under the new guidelines, it's recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.",
      "Finally, in a third category, for children not in high-risk groups, the decision on whether to receive certain vaccines should be based on \"shared clinical decision-making\" between physicians and parents, according to the CDC. Those immunizations include COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.",
      "\"It's very complicated to try to figure out the risks and the benefits,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on the \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It's so important to have a health care provider with whom you can discuss this openly and empathetically.\"",
      "He noted, \"The American Academy of Pediatrics calls today's recommendations dangerous and said they're going to continue to give their own recommendations.\"",
      "The changes follow a controversial December recommendation on when children should receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been hand-picked by Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.\"",
      "\"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,\" he said.",
      "President Trump called the updates \"a far more reasonable schedule, where all children will only be recommended to receive vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases.\" But parents could still choose to give their children other vaccinations and those will still be covered by insurance, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The assessment compared the U.S. vaccine schedule to those of 20 other developed nations and found that the U.S. is a \"global outlier\" in both the number of diseases addressed and total number of recommended doses, according to the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0has disputed that, saying the longstanding U.S. recommendations were based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called Monday's announcement a \"reckless step.\"",
      "\"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,\" he said in a statement. The biggest\u00a0measles outbreak\u00a0in more than 30 years has sickened more than 2,000 people across the U.S. Most of those sickened were not vaccinated, and two children died.",
      "Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, warned that the change in the CDC's vaccine recommendations will put children at risk.",
      "\"Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\" Osterholm told The Associated Press.",

    "summary": "After the U.S. deposed Maduro, Trump and top officials did not rule out efforts at overthrow or annexation in other countries. Here's what they've said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "Administration officials are discussing a \"range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

    "summary": "At least 29 Iranian protesters have reportedly been killed in unrest across the nation, putting its rulers under huge pressure after Trump threatened to intervene.",
    "story": [
      "At least 29 protesters have been killed as major anti-government demonstrations spread across Iran for a 10th day, a U.S.-based rights group says. The Iranian government is trying to quell the unrest, and reacted angrily to President Trump's veiled threat of a U.S. armed intervention.",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which gave the death toll based on its network of contacts in the country, said in its daily report on Monday that more than 1,200 people had been detained by Iranian security forces since the protests started more than a week ago. HRANA shared video on Tuesday that it said showed clashes between protesters and security forces at Tehran's Grand Bazaar \u2014 a center of commerce in the capital where shop owners have long backed the regime.",
      "The protests began more than a week ago in Tehran as business owners took to the streets to vent their frustration over soaring inflation in the nation, whose economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years. But the anger spread quickly to more than 250 locations in at least 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the Washington-based HRANA, with social media videos showing violent clashes between protesters chanting anti-government slogans and security forces every night since.",
      "People who spoke with CBS News from inside the country on Tuesday said the latest demonstrations in the capital were relatively small, corroborating other reports that efforts by the Iranian authorities to placate the protesters have likely had some effect in reducing numbers in recent days.",
      "President Trump said Friday \u2014 a day before American forces attacked Venezuela and captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro \u2014 that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded and ready,\" warning that if Iran \"violently kills protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't offered any further detail on his threat, but he's been ratcheting up pressure on Tehran since taking office for his second term, including with unprecedented U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear facilities in June as Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday.",
      "As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control.",
      "Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel \u2014 something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June \u2014 in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly.",
      "But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation.",
      "In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households.",
      "The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services.",
      "So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating \u2014   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country \u2014   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded.",
      "In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",
      "A brief history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency.",
      "It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, and the European nation carried on as a colonial ruler of Greenland until 1953, when it fully laid out its relations with the island as a semi-autonomous territory.",

    "story": [
      "European leaders released a joint statement Tuesday, outlining the importance of Arctic security, but stressing that \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" hours after White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said it was \"the formal position of the U.S. government... that Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Miller also said, in an interview Monday with CNN, that \"the United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous  territory of Denmark, and has been tied to the small European nation for 300 years, though it has its own elected government. The largest island in the world, it is located to the northeast of Canada and is about the size of  Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to  only around 60,000 people.",

      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said in their joint statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

    "story": [
      "The United States' biggest strategic adversaries quickly condemned President Trump's decision to order U.S. strikes on Venezuela and the raid to capture now-former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. China, Russia and Iran all called it a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty and international law. Cuba, just south of the U.S. and a close ally of Caracas, also condemned the attack as President Trump predicted his decisions could lead to the collapse of the government in Havana.",
      "As all of those countries had maintained close economic and political ties with the Maduro regime, the dramatic, unilateral U.S. action is likely to have some impact on them, and while that impact may not be tremendous financially in all cases, the message sent by Mr. Trump could be just as important.",
      "\"What I think is clear is that we're entering a new phase of great power competition,\" Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas Program and head of the Future of Venezuela Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News. \"Some of the rules, some of the unthinkables, some of the things that we wouldn't have previously imagined being part of the operation are now on the table as options.\"",

      "China, which buys most of Venezuela's oil, said it was \"deeply shocked\" by the weekend strikes and removal of Maduro, and the foreign ministry in Beijing said the U.S. had \"clearly violated international law\" with its actions.",
      "\"We have never believed that any country can act as the world's police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world's judge,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday, citing \"sudden developments in Venezuela\" without explicitly mentioning the U.S.",
      "\"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law,\" he said, speaking for the first time since Maduro's capture by U.S. special forces.",
      "China's official foreign policy is broadly based on a position of neutrality when it comes to foreign conflicts, and despite Beijing's continuing economic support for Venezuela and unwavering political ties amid the standoff between Caracas and Washington, some analysts say China is unlikely to intervene directly.",
      "\"There isn't much in the way of material support that China can offer Venezuela at this time, but rhetorically, Beijing will be very important when it leads the effort at the U.N. and with other developing countries to rally opinion against the U.S.,\" Eric Olander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project, told the Reuters news agency. \"What we've seen in the cases of Zimbabwe and Iran, both sanctioned by the West, is that China demonstrates its commitment to these relationships through trade and investment, even under difficult circumstances.\"",
      "But that economic bond was likely far more vital to the geopolitically isolated Maduro regime than it was to China.",
      "China's purchases have amounted to a whopping 80% of Venezuela's total, relatively paltry petroleum exports, which Reuters said amounted to less than a million barrels per day during 2025 (compared to about 3 million barrels per day 25 years ago). According to Reuters, Venezuelan exports amounted to only about 4% of the oil China has purchased in recent years.",
      "But Berg said even if President Trump does get U.S. oil firms to move in and start rebuilding Venezuela's decrepit infrastructure to boost production, there are still financial implications for Beijing.",
      "\"The big question that remains unknown at this point is whether all of that production, and especially any increase in production in Venezuela that might occur, is going to come to the United States, or whether it will be sold on international markets,\" Berg told CBS News. \"Remember, Venezuela was sending about 80% of its oil to China. Much of that was to service debt. If China all of a sudden doesn't get that 80% of Venezuela's exports, it is not only losing energy security, but also in a situation where Venezuela is now no longer repaying its debts.\"",
      "\"There's a huge risk here for China that some of its energy security is in fact redirected away from China and toward the United States or toward other markets because of this play in Venezuela,\" Berg said. \"China has a way to make up for what Venezuela represented, but it is not going to be easy, especially as the United States is simultaneously squeezing Iran, one of its other top sources of oil.\"",
      "On the non-economic front, there's also concern that Chinese President Xi Jinping could use Trump's move as justification to launch his own unilateral military action, with an invasion of Taiwan, the U.S.-backed democratic island just off mainland China's coast.",
      "Taiwan punches well above its weight economically thanks to close ties with the West and as the world's most important producer of advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence and weapons.",
      "Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has reiterated his policy of unifying China with Taiwan, and he has never ruled out the use of force to do so.",
      "Russia condemns \"destabilizing\" action, 4 years into its invasion of Ukraine",
      "In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin had still issued no public comment on the American attack on Venezuela by Tuesday, but former President Dmitry Medvedev, who often telegraphs the Kremlin's talking points, said Washington's actions were both \"illegal\" and \"destabilizing.\"",
      "Medvedev also said, however, that the moves ordered by Mr. Trump were in defense of U.S. national interests, given Venezuela's vast proven oil reserves.",
      "\"It must be acknowledged that, despite the obvious unlawfulness of Trump's behavior, one cannot deny a certain consistency in his actions,\" Medvedev said, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency. \"He and his team defend their country's national interests quite harshly.\"",
      "Berg said the U.S. operation in Venezuela supports a philosophy held by Russia's government, which launched the ongoing war in Ukraine with its full-scale invasion of the resource-rich eastern part of the neighboring country nearly four years ago.",
      "\"The Russians have for a long time thought of themselves as a great power, and in their opinion, great powers get exclusive spheres of influence to behave how they wish. I think it guides much of their behavior in Eurasia, and certainly in Ukraine. And I think they think the same way about the United States,\" Berg said.",
      "Berg said Russia uses its relationships in what it perceives as the spheres of influence of other great powers to show its strength.",
      "\"Every time they are ready to pursue aggression in the European theater, it's almost like clockwork, they have a trip of a significant political official to Latin America and the Caribbean,\" Berg said.",
      "Russia did this ahead of its invasion of Georgia in 2008, for instance, when then-President Dmitry Medvedev visited Venezuela and Russia carried out joint naval exercises with Venezuelan forces. It was the first major Russian fleet deployment to the region since the end of the Cold War.",
      "As Russian forces seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, meanwhile, Putin visited Brazil and met with Maduro and other Latin American leaders. Then, in a visit that ended less than a week before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov visited Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.",
      "These were all \"significant diplomatic visits to Latin America that were meant to show visibility to the United States, and they presaged aggression in the European theater,\" Berg said.",
      "Iran grappling with protests under a threat from Trump",
      "Iranian government forces have been trying to quell protests against the country's rulers for 10 days \u2014 the most significant unrest to sweep the nation since 2022. So far, at least 29 protesters have been killed amid clashes with security personnel, the U.S.-based Human Rights News Agency group said Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week that if Iran, \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" warning that his administration was \"locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that Iran would \"not yield to the enemy,\" and reiterated a common claim that the U.S. and Israel were behind the anti-government unrest.",
      "But for some Iranians, desperate to see the end of more than four decades of rule by hardline Islamic clerics, the U.S. action against Venezuela has fueled hope that Mr. Trump might wield similar pressure tactics against their own authoritarian leadership.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that (message), have been inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the Iranian news site IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "\"I don't think (the protests) are going to lead to the toppling of the regime, because there is no alternative in sight,\" Bahari said. \"But there will be some change in the actions of the regime, change in the decisions of the regime, especially after President Trump's message.\"",
      "The protests across Iran were echoed in London over the weekend, where one demonstrator who said she would like to see the country's former Western-backed monarchy restored told CBS News she hoped Mr. Trump's action in Venezuela would send a signal to Tehran.",
      "\"What's happening in Venezuela is a kind of warning for the Islamic Republic. That's the message from America or Israel: 'That will happen to you, Khamenei.' That's the message,\" said the protester, who gave only her first name, Ghazal.",
      "When asked if she believed the people braving Iran's security forces to protest might also be looking at Venezuela and hoping for similar action in their own nation, Ghazal reiterated her optimism.",
      "\"Definitely something will change, and the Islamic Republic will fall down very soon,\" she said.",
      "Trump says \"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall\"",
      "A day after the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Mr. Trump predicted to journalists on Air Force One that Cuba's 67-year-old communist government could soon collapse as a result of the operation.",
      "\"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income. They got all their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"",
      "\"What President Trump was referring to is actually internal regime collapse,\" Berg said, stressing that Cuba is \"going through one of the worst moments that it's had since the 1990s,\" when the Soviet Union dissolved, taking its support for the Caribbean island nation with it.",
      "\"I imagine that one of the demands of the new government in Venezuela would be to cut off the shipments of barrels of oil to Cuba, some of which is used to satisfy the domestic demand within Cuba, but also a lot of it sent onwards and sold to other markets for profit,\" Berg told CBS News. \"If that support dries up, Cuba will be in an even tougher position.\"",
      "Maduro was an important economic and political partner to Cuba, and the government in Havana said 32 Cuban nationals were killed in the U.S. operation in Venezuela \u2014 security forces who were there serving at Venezuela's request.",
      "\"For that sister nation and for her people, we are ready to give, as for Cuba, from our own blood,\" the Cuban government said in a statement Saturday, condemning the U.S. operation. Cuba's government called on the international community to condemn the U.S. actions and impose consequences.",
      "\"All of the nations in the region should be on alert, because the threat hangs over all of them,\" the statement said.",
      "But even if the current government in Cuba does collapse, Berg doesn't foresee a pro-American regime taking its place.",
      "\"When it comes to the Cuban regime, we have decades and decades of anti-Americanism \u2014 so-called anti-imperialism,\" he said, calling a \"night-to-day flip to become pro-American and pursue policies that somehow give them autonomy from U.S. pressure\" highly unlikely.",

      "Geneva \u2014 Fire safety inspections hadn't been carried out for several years at the bar where a fire that broke out at a New Year's party left 40 people dead and over 100 injured, local authorities said Tuesday.",
      "Investigators have said they believe festive sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire at Le Constellation in the resort town of Crans-Montana when they came too close to the ceiling. Authorities are looking into whether soundproofing material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.",
      "Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, according to the Valais region's chief prosecutor.",
      "Regional authorities have said that safety inspections are the responsibility of the municipality. On Tuesday, the Crans-Montana municipality said inspections of Le Constellation that included fire safety checks had been carried out in 2016, 2018 and 2019, and that modifications had been requested - but no issues with soundproofing measures had been raised.",
      "The local council discovered after consulting documents after the fire that \"periodic checks were not carried out between 2020 and 2025,\" the head of Crans-Montana's municipal government, Nicolas F\u00e9raud, told a news conference.",
      "\"We regret this bitterly,\" he said, adding that it will be up to judicial authorities to determine what influence that may have had on the chain of events that led to the fire. \"We owe it to the families, and we will accept responsibility,\" F\u00e9raud\u00a0 said.",
      "\"This tragedy has brought a sentiment of uncertainty all across the region. We're now putting everything in order to reassure\" people, he said.",
      "F\u00e9raud said he couldn't immediately explain why safety inspections hadn't been conducted for such a long time.",
      "He said that in September last year, an external expert had been asked to carry out a soundproofing analysis and had concluded that the bar complied with anti-noise rules, without making further remarks.",
      "The severity of burns made it difficult to identify some victims of the fire that broke out at about 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Day, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples.",
      "Investigators finished identifying the 40 dead on Sunday and said on Monday that they had identified all 116 people who were injured.",
      "F\u00e9raud said reports from the inspections that were carried out mentioned a maximum capacity of 100 people on the bar's ground floor and 100 in its basement. It's unclear how many people were in Le Constellation when the blaze broke out and investigators have said that may never be known.",
      "The municipality said the bar's owner obtained a permit to build a veranda in 2015 and also carried out interior work at the bar that did not require a permit.",
      "It said it has now decided to ban the use of fireworks indoors and to commission an external agency to carry out inspections of such establishments.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed new details Monday about the U.S. operation to capture and arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, describing a meticulously planned raid that caught the Venezuelan leader completely off guard.",
      "Speaking to sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Roughly 200 Americans carried out the overnight raid Saturday at Maduro's residence in downtown Caracas, Hegseth said. Fighter jets and bombers struck Venezuelan air defenses, clearing the way for Delta Force commandos to close in on the compound, where they came under heavy fire.",
      "\"They got off the helicopter, and the bullets were flying all over the place,\" President Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. \"As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back.\"",
      "Several U.S. soldiers were injured in the operation, according to U.S. officials. Dozens of Venezuelans were killed, along with 32 Cuban citizens who were part of Maduro's security detail, Cuba's government said.",
      "\"There was a lot of death on the other side, unfortunately. But a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday trying to protect him,\" Trump said.",
      "Once U.S. forces breached the compound, they intercepted Maduro before he could reach a safe room, officials said. The raid had been rehearsed for months using a replica of Maduro's residence to prepare for multiple scenarios.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation was built around repetition and redundancy.",
      "\"We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again and again, not to get it right, but to ensure that we cannot get it wrong,\" Caine said.",
      "CIA personnel inside Venezuela had been tracking Maduro's movements since August, including through an agent who penetrated his inner circle and provided key intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",

    "summary": "With Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in U.S. custody, who is Venezuela's new acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, and what are her chances of remaining in power?",
    "story": [
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in early Monday as Venezuela's new interim president while her predecessor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro awaited arraignment in a federal U.S. court on drug smuggling charges, two days after he was captured in Caracas by American special forces.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez, 56, is a powerful figure and longtime confidant of Maduro, and she has been backed thus far as the nation's new leader by Venezuela's military. She served as Venezuela's vice president from 2018 until Sunday.",
      "Her brother also holds a senior role in the government as president of the National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, which has long been controlled by the Maduro regime.",
      "She quickly denounced the U.S. operation as a violation of the United Nations founding charter and a unilateral attempt to force regime change on Saturday, but soon adopted a more conciliatory tone.",
      "In a\u00a0social media post following a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez called for \"respectful international relations\" between Caracas and Washington and extended an invite for \"the U.S. government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation.\"",
      "Venezuela's roughly 30 million people face a deeply uncertain future in the wake of President Trump's actions. It was still unclear on Monday how much autonomy Washington will allow the country, given Mr. Trump's assertion that America will \"run\" Venezuela, at least for some time.",
      "Will the U.S. work with Rodr\u00edguez?",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez and \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in an interview with\u00a0The Atlantic published on Sunday, he added a warning.",
      "\"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in a Sunday interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the U.S. was willing to give Rodr\u00edguez a chance.",
      "\"We are going to make our assessments of people,\" he said of the remaining Maduro regime figures still in place. \"We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some of what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking on ABC's \"This Week\" the same day, Rubio reiterated, however, that the Trump administration does not consider Rodr\u00edguez or any of her cohorts to have any legitimate claim to power in the country.",
      "\"This is not about the legitimate president. We don't believe that this regime in place is legitimate via an election,\" Rubio told ABC.",
      "\"Ultimately, legitimacy for their system of government will come about through a period of transition and real elections,\" he continued. \"It's the reason why Maduro is not just an indicted drug trafficker \u2014 he [was an] illegitimate president. He was not the head of state.\"",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez's rise to power in Venezuela",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas. Her father was Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a prominent leader of the country's socialist movement that would go on to take power under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The new president's father, however, helped lead the movement before it seized power, and he was arrested for involvement in the kidnapping of American businessman William Niehous in 1976.",
      "He died in police custody, reportedly as he was tortured by the previous Venezuelan regime's security forces.",
      "His daughter Delcy would go on to study law at the Central University of Venezuela, in Caracas, with further periods of education in Britain and France.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez held a number of positions during Ch\u00e1vez's long reign, but she only rose to real prominence under Maduro. From 2013 to 2014, she served as Minister of Popular Power for Communication and Information before being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a title she held from 2014 to 2017.",
      "She also presided over an assembly created in response to mass street protests in 2017, which was widely seen as an attempt to sideline the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, to enable Maduro to consolidate his rule.",
      "In 2018, Maduro appointed her as Venezuela's vice president, and she remained in that post until stepping in to replace her former boss, as ordered by the country's supreme court following the dramatic events of the weekend.",
      "In 2020, Rodr\u00edguez was also appointed as her country's Minister of Economy and Finance, where she's credited with helping to achieve some progress toward stabilizing Venezuela's sanctions-wracked economy after years of soaring inflation.",
      "In 2024, the role of Minister of Petroleum was also added to her resume.",
      "Despite her very high profile role in the Maduro regime, however, Rodr\u00edguez has not been indicted on any criminal charges in the U.S., though she was hit with sanctions imposed during President Trump's first term, for her role in helping Maduro \"maintain power and solidify his authoritarian rule.\"",

      "\"For high-grade tumors like Gleason 8, 9 or 10, we believe they progress quickly, so we recommend treatment to prevent the risk of metastasis,\" said Punnen, who is also vice chair of research and a professor with the Desai Sethi Urology Institute at UHealth. \"For low-risk tumors, we think they pose little risk, so we recommend just observation.\"",
      "\"The fact that cancers are occurring earlier is a justification for heightened screenings, not the opposite.\"",
      "\"But in the end, we can't be sure, so our approach to observation includes serial monitoring of cancer status with PSA, MRI and occasional biopsy to ensure the tumor isn't progressing.\"",
      "No. 2: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)",
      "Also known as stage 0 breast cancer, DCIS is a non-invasive disease marked by abnormal cells in the lining of the breast milk ducts. The \"in situ\" is Latin for \"in the original place,\" which indicates that the cancer has not spread outside the milk ducts.",

      "If approved, it would become the first treatment to prevent overdoses of fentanyl, which is the leading cause of drug overdose deaths, statistics show.",
      "DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS",
      "This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",
      "How it works",
      "The vaccine is designed to create antibodies against fentanyl, which keeps the drug from crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier.",
      "It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific advisor of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, the fentanyl would be eliminated from the body.",
      "MAJOR CANNABIS STUDY FINDS LITTLE PROOF FOR POPULAR MEDICAL CLAIMS, FLAGS BIG DANGERS",
      "In the mice and rat studies, the animals still had antibodies against fentanyl six months after vaccination, added Haile, who is also a research associate professor of psychology at UH and a founding member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute.",
      "While some have questioned whether such a vaccine would indirectly encourage drug use, Haile pointed out that, for vaccinated people, the drug would have \"no euphoric effects.\" So, those seeking a \"high\" would not get it.",
      "Fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana. (iStock)",
      "The main benefit, according to Haile, is that the vaccine would reduce the potential health dangers of fentanyl.",
      "\"Respiratory depression is the primary effect that induces death from this highly potent synthetic opioid,\" he said.",
      "Headed for trials",
      "Following successful testing in mice and rats, the first human clinical trial is slated to begin in early 2026 at the Center for Human Drug Research, which is associated with the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.",
      "\"They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "The small Phase 1 trial will enroll about 40 participants, focusing on safety and immune response.",
      "After the Phase 1 trial for safety, a Phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data so far is available only for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"Also, unlike other vaccines, we use extremely low doses of the components,\" he noted. \"We have put the vaccine into a lot of animals and have not seen any adverse side effects at all.\"",
      "Even in a toxicology study, during which the researchers administered 20 times the dose of the vaccine that would be given to humans, they still saw no overt signs of toxicity, according to Haile.",
      "Potential use cases",
      "Haile mentioned several different use cases for the vaccine, primarily those with opioid use disorder who want to quit using fentanyl.",
      "It could also be used by first responders and healthcare workers who want to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Military and national security personnel could also benefit from the vaccine, Haile said, as it could help protect against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds that have been used as chemical threats.",
      "Finally, parents may be seeking protection for at-risk teens or young adults, as fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana.",
      "The progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside,\" a medical expert said. (iStock)",
      "Looking ahead, Haile said this could pave the way for the approval of other anti-drug vaccines, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which are already in the works.",
      "\"If we can tackle the primary ones \u2014 fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 we will be saving hundreds of thousands of lives,\" he added.",
      "\"This is likely to prevent many overdoses where a patient is sedated and stops breathing as a result of fentanyl.\"",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News, said the progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside.\"",
      "\"I am very glad it is now entering human trials. It is being very well-studied,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This is likely to prevent many overdoses where a patient is sedated and stops breathing as a result of fentanyl.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "The antidote for fentanyl (Narcan) is limited because fentanyl lasts for many hours, but the Narcan (an opioid antagonist) wears off after only a few hours and has to be administered again, Siegel pointed out.",
      "\"You want to make sure this vaccine is limited to those really at risk for opioid overdoses and addiction because fentanyl is also a useful pain medication for cancer and a useful agent for anesthesia,\" the doctor added.",

      "\"Varying movements, intensities and rhythms force the body to adapt, helping to activate all muscle groups more effectively,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 philosophy \u2014 if we don\u2019t actively support flexibility and mobility, we risk losing them.\"",

Canadian lawmakers are concerned that increased oil exports from Venezuela to the United States, which is Canada's largest oil purchaser, will displace oil from Canada, forcing the country to drop its prices in order to stay competitive.",

    "summary": "Maduro&apos;s arrest and indictment echo a case the U.S. brought more than 30 years ago against Panama&apos;s leader, Manuel Noriega.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' CB Cotton reports the latest on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's arrest. Former Attorney General Bill Barr also weighs in on his capture and his outlook for conviction on 'Fox News Sunday.'",
      "Ousted Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro appeared for the first time in federal court in the U.S. on Monday, where the presiding judge ticked through the charges filed against him: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons charges.",
      "Maduro, who pleaded not guilty, was defiant. \"I\u2019m still the president of my country,\" he said, furiously scribbling on a legal pad for the duration of the arraignment. \"I\u2019m a prisoner of war,\" he proclaimed later, as he was led out of the court and back to the Brooklyn detention center where he is being held.",
      "Maduro\u2019s remarks underpinned a key argument his legal team is expected to use in defending him \u2013 arguing that he was illegally captured by U.S. troops, and that he is immune from prosecution in the U.S. as the leader of a sovereign foreign nation.",
      "His lawyers won\u2019t be the first to try to advance that argument in court. In fact, Maduro\u2019s case bears some notable (if early) parallels to the U.S. invasion of another Latin American country, 36 years prior, in which 26,000 U.S. troops descended into Panama to arrest the country's authoritarian leader, Manuel Noriega, and bring him to the U.S. to be tried on federal criminal charges in Miami. The U.S. arrest of Noriega, dubbed Operation \"Just Cause,\" could be used as a playbook of sorts for prosecutors as they present their case against Maduro and his wife in the Southern District in New York.",
      "Here are some of the biggest similarities, and differences, between the two cases.",
      "DEFIANT MADURO DECLARES HE IS A 'PRISONER OF WAR' IN FIRST US COURT APPEARANCE",
      "Captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appear with their attorneys Barry Pollack and Mark Donnelly at their arraignment in a federal court in New York City on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "On Dec. 20, 1989, under then-President George H.W. Bush, U.S. forces launched a surprise invasion of Panama that resulted in Noriega's arrest nearly two weeks later.",
      "Like Maduro, Noriega's lawyers centered their case on the argument that he was arrested illegally by U.S. troops in his home country, and that as a foreign leader, he could not be criminally charged in other countries.",
      "But Maduro's argument here could be stronger than the Panamanian strongman. That's because Noriega was never formally elected to lead Panama \u2013 instead, he was in charge of the country's military, and leveraged power via \"shadow\" or puppet presidents that he installed.",
      "Maduro's argument that he is a foreign sovereign is likely to be rebuffed by prosecutors, since the U.S. and other democratic countries do not recognize his \"victory\" in the 2024 presidential election as legitimate.",
      "Still, Maduro's actions could warrant a higher level of scrutiny, since he was at one time the recognized, legitimate leader of Venezuela. How, or to what degree, this will factor into Maduro's case remains unclear.",
      "MADURO MET CHINESE ENVOY HOURS BEFORE US CAPTURE FROM CARACAS AS BEIJING SLAMS OPERATION",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are seen in handcuffs as they make their way into an armored car en route to a U.S. courthouse in Manhattan on Jan. 5, 2026, in New York City. (XNY/Star Max/GC Images)",
      "Like Maduro, Noriega was a Latin American strongman whose country held significant strategic assets for the U.S. and others in the region. Both arrests came as drug trafficking \u2013 and the flow of drugs into the U.S. \u2013 had taken on outsize importance, including in the late 1980s under then-President George H.W. Bush and now under the Trump administration, said Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).",
      "Both Noriega and Maduro are accused of participating in large-scale drug smuggling operations in their respective countries, according to copies of both criminal indictments reviewed by Fox News Digital.",
      "Noriega was charged with conspiring with drug traffickers to funnel cocaine into the U.S., among other things. Maduro is accused of heading up a corrupt and illegitimate government that the indictment against him says has \"leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity,\" including drug activity, for decades, according to the newly unsealed criminal indictment. It also alleges that he used his post to help run \"state-sponsored gangs\" such as Tren de Aragua (TdA).",
      "\"The defendants, together and with others, engaged in a relentless campaign of cocaine trafficking throughout the time period charged in this superseding indictment, resulting in the distribution of thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States,\" federal prosecutors said in Maduro's indictment.",
      "One similarity underpinning the arrests of both Latin American leaders was a heightened domestic focus on cracking down on drug trafficking. In the run-up to Maduro's arrest, and Noriega's some three decades prior, drug trafficking \"had become this very salient issue for the U.S. public,\" Freeman told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "\"First, because of the crack cocaine epidemic,\" under the H.W. Bush administration, \"and now, with the fentanyl epidemic.\"",
      "\"There was this focus, or need, to legitimately find out who in the region was in some sense an accomplice in both cases,\" he added.",
      "MADURO-BACKED TDA GANG\u2019S EXPANSION INTO US CITIES EMERGES AS KEY FOCUS OF SWEEPING DOJ INDICTMENT",
      "Acting Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro waves to supporters as he leaves after voting for the successor to the late President Hugo Chavez, in Caracas on April 14, 2013.\u00a0 (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)",
      "In Noriega's case, it was the Panama Canal, the geographically strategic and economically vital waypoint that currently accounts for some 40% of U.S. container ship traffic, or some $270 billion in cargo annually.",
      "Noriega at the time had signaled that the government \"might do something to disrupt the canal, or let other actors do that,\" said Freeman, the Latin American fellow for the Council on Foreign Relations,.",
      "Venezuela, of course, is home to vast oilfields that are believed to be crucial to meeting the projected demand forecasts for the years ahead.",
      "Venezuela has the largest amount of oil reserves compared to any other country in the world, experts noted \u2013 making it a strategically crucial location in the coming years, despite the significant investments needed in infrastructure before its fields can produce.",
      "Perhaps the most important distinction between the two cases is the fact that in Panama, the \"Just Cause\" operation that resulted in Noriega's arrest was carried out after the Panamanian general assembly had already formally declared war against the U.S., as Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck noted in his Substack newsletter.",
      "A U.S. Marine \"had been shot and killed before President George H.W. Bush authorized the underlying operation,\" Vladeck said, a point noted by Freeman, as well.",
      "\"The tougher nuts for prosecutors to crack will be Maduro\u2019s arguments that he\u2019s entitled to some kind of immunity,\" Vladeck continued: \"Whether because he was Venezuela\u2019s \u2018head of state\u2019 or because, even if he wasn\u2019t, his alleged crimes all arise from official acts conducted with governmental authority.\"",
      "Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega at a ceremony commemorating the death of the national hero, Omar Torrijo, in Panama City.\u00a0 (Bill Gentile/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)",
      "Still, prosecutors could enjoy a wider degree of latitude in Maduro's case, in yet another echo of Noriega's trial. Noriega was convicted in the U.S. on eight of the 10 charges brought against him in his April 1992 criminal trial, and sentenced to serve 17 years in prison. He was extradited to France for money laundering convictions, and then again to Panama, in 2011, where he was sentenced to 60 years in prison. (Noriega died in 2017.)",
      "Then-Assistant U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr had authored a memo in 1989 that argued that a president has the \"inherent constitutional authority\" to order the FBI take people into custody on foreign soil. It was published months before Noriega's arrest, and was crucial for prosecutors in defending against some of the claims from his defense attorneys and arguing the legitimacy of their case.",
      "The same memo could be referenced by prosecutors in Maduro's case as well, should they face any hurdles in arguing his arrest was legitimate.",
      "Another key issue that weighed in Noriega's favor is the ability for the U.S. courts to even consider the legality of the invasion. In Noriega's case, the federal courts \"refused to consider the legality of the invasion itself,\" Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies at the CATO Institute, said in a post published on the site after Maduro's capture.",
      "\"Federal courts held that the manner in which a defendant is brought before a US court \u2013 even by force, even from foreign soil \u2013 does not defeat criminal jurisdiction,\" Neily said.",
      "In Panama, a more \"classic national security type [of observer] or a realist could say, 'Okay, there's a reason that stability and having influence in Panama is extremely important to us,'\" Freeman said.",
      "In Venezuela, the through-line between the country's actions and the harm to U.S. interests is slightly less clear, he said, prompting some to question why the U.S. is getting so involved.",
      "This has been the position taken by at least two Republicans, including Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., two outspoken Trump critics.",
      "Massie, who has broken with Trump on several notable recent occasions, appeared more skeptical of the criminal charges the U.S. used in justifying Maduro\u2019s arrest, noting on social media that the 25-page indictment made \"no mention of fentanyl or stolen oil\" cited by President Donald Trump.",

      "\"By the time Governor Tim Walz was selected, Minnesota\u2019s fraud scandals were already public, already under federal investigation, and already raising serious questions about oversight. That wasn\u2019t hidden information \u2014 it was an open and growing issue, despite a local media environment that protects Democrats.\"",

      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz holds a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Jan. 5, 2026. (Kerem Y\u00fccel/Minnesota Public Radio via AP)",
      "Former Obama-era attorney general Eric Holder was a key figure in the vetting process for the Harris campaign, and he defended his due diligence on Walz,\u00a0telling CNN that \"nothing of substance\" was missed in regard to Walz\u2019s record, which Nagel told Fox News Digital \"raised more questions than it answered\" given the visibility of fraud concerns.",
      "\"Either possibility is troubling,\" Nagel told Fox News Digital. \"If Kamala Harris didn\u2019t know, that points to a deeply flawed vetting process and an insane level of hubris. If she did know and proceeded anyway, that suggests accountability simply wasn\u2019t a priority.\"",
      "Michael Ceraso, a veteran Democratic strategist, told Fox News Digital the Harris campaign was likely aware of the fraud reports, but internally compared it to Trump's controversies and concluded it\u2019s \"not as bad.\"",

      "Gov. Tim Walz signed into law a sweeping package of police accountability measures Thursday, July 23, 2020, in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "\"Maybe the standard was different because they understood who they were running against, and maybe they were blas\u00e9 about it because they were looking at their opponent and saying, well, this may not be as comparable to this, and so we can excuse this because this guy over here has done X, Y, and Z,\" Ceraso explained.",
      "Going forward, Ceraso said the Democratic Party could arguably \"put itself in a position as being the values party\" by placing more emphasis on vetting issues on their own merits rather than comparing records to Trump.",
      "\"The Democratic Party needs to be better because we can all be better, but I think comparing ourselves to a president that we obviously disagree with morally and saying, well, we're not as bad as that, but still let a multi-billion dollar corruption thing happen with no accountability. That's still pretty bad.\"",
      "Nagel told Fox News Digital that if Harris decides to run for political office in the future that this issue will likely come up.",
      "\"Voters deserve to know how decisions at the highest levels are made \u2014 and whether political considerations outweighed transparency and accountability,\" Nagel said. \"Unfortunately, if Kamala decides to run in 2028, legacy media outlets will likely not press her on her choice of Walz. I expect that to only be raised in Democrat circles during a presidential debate during the primaries.\"",
      "Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office for comment.",
      "Walz has also faced criticism in recent days for comments he made on the campaign trail touting childcare programs in Minnesota, suggesting it should be a model for the nation, even though the Feeding Our Future scandal had been bubbling for years.",

      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",

      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Analysts uncovered a coordinated campaign that hid spyware inside everyday browser tools like new tab pages and translators. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "DarkSpectre is a reminder that online threats are getting smarter and quieter. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today. Browser extensions can be helpful, but every extra add-on is another door into your browser. Paying attention, cleaning house now and then, and questioning what you install can make a real difference.",

      "Chrome extensions are supposed to make your browser more useful, but they've quietly become one of the easiest ways for attackers to spy on what you do online. Security researchers recently uncovered two Chrome extensions that have been doing exactly that for years.",
      "These extensions looked like harmless proxy tools, but behind the scenes, they were hijacking traffic and stealing sensitive data from users who trusted them. What makes this case worse is where these extensions were found. Both were listed on Chrome's official extension marketplace.",

      "Security researchers uncovered malicious Chrome extensions that quietly routed users\u2019 web traffic through attacker-controlled servers to steal sensitive data. (Gokhan Balci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",

      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",

      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",

      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations.

OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web.

      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",

      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",
      "Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

      "Most robot headlines follow a familiar script: a machine masters one narrow trick in a controlled lab, then comes the bold promise that everything is about to change. I usually tune those stories out. We have heard about robots taking over since science fiction began, yet real-life robots still struggle with basic flexibility. This time felt different.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",
      "More broadly, it signals a shift in artificial intelligence. We are moving away from flashy tricks and toward systems that learn in more human-like ways. Not smarter than people. Just closer to how we actually operate day to day.",

When machines start learning more like humans, the conversation changes. The question shifts from what robots can repeat to what they can adapt to next. That shift is worth paying attention to.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from fake AI chat malware",
      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",

      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning.

      "Seattle\u2019s new mayor is facing growing scrutiny over her approach to public safety after an internal police email outlined how most drug possession and public use cases are being directed toward diversion rather than prosecution \u2014 prompting backlash from critics who say the approach sends the wrong message as open drug use remains visible across the city.",
      "The controversy erupted after Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes circulated an internal message detailing how low-level drug cases will be handled in 2026, fueling concerns among critics that the city is effectively softening enforcement just weeks into Mayor Katie Wilson\u2019s administration. City officials insist there has been no policy change, but critics argue the practical impact tells a different story.",
      "In the internal email obtained by Fox News Digital, Barnes wrote that \"all charges related to drug possession and/or drug use will be diverted from prosecution to the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program,\" citing guidance from the City Attorney\u2019s Office. The directive applies to user-quantity cases, while drug dealers and those ineligible for LEAD remain subject to prosecution.",

He warned the strategy could lead to increased crime and overdose deaths, referring to the philosophy behind it as \"suicidal empathy.\"",
      "Solan also said many officers are skeptical of the LEAD program, telling Rantz that some avoid making LEAD referrals altogether because they believe the program is ineffective and driven more by ideology than accountability.",
      "\"The recent naive, ignorant political decision to not arrest offenders for open drug use in the City of Seattle is horrifically dangerous and will create more death and societal decay,\" Solan told Rantz. \"It embodies an enormous flaw in those in our community who think that meeting people where they are who are in the throes of addiction, is the correct path to lift them up.\"",

That administration prioritized reaching a diplomatic accommodation with the Islamic Republic and reintegrating the regime into the international system.

      "As Venezuela enters the post-Nicolas Maduro era, former officials and regional experts warn the country may be facing not a democratic transition, but a period of deeper instability and internal conflict between possible successors that some warn could be even worse than Maduro.",
      "Marshall Billingslea, the former assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes in the U.S. Treasury Department, said Maduro\u2019s removal has exposed a fractured system that was never held together by a single strongman, but by competing criminal power centers now moving independently.",

      "At the same time, former officials say Rodr\u00edguez appears to be testing cooperation with Washington, creating uncertainty over how much leverage the United States actually holds.

      "UNITED NATIONS: A deepening political realignment across Latin America came into focus over the weekend at a summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and sharpened further Monday at the United Nations Security Council, where governments publicly split over the U.S. role in the capture of Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "At CELAC, several leftist governments attempted to push through a joint statement condemning Maduro\u2019s detention.

      "The shift is increasingly visible at the ballot box, where voters in several countries \u2014 last month alone in Chile and Honduras \u2014 have moved away from entrenched left-wing governments and toward right-of-center leaders campaigning on themes of security, sovereignty, border control and law and order \u2014 messages that echo aspects of President Donald Trump\u2019s political approach in the United States.",

      "\"The developments at CELAC this weekend reflect that reality,\" Maldonado said. \"The fact that several governments blocked a collective defense of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro shows how divided the authoritarian left has become. Venezuela has become a cautionary tale.\"",

      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Content creator Pedro Luis Garc\u00eda said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours.",
      "Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way.",
      "Cuba\u2019s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were \u201cpouring\u201d through Mexico and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d",
      "A defiant government response",
      "The day Maduro was captured, Cuba\u2019s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech. D\u00edaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the \u201cobscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel also said that \u201cfor Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana.",
      "In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, \u201cWe need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn\u2019t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "Alzugaray added that Cuba\u2019s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia.",
      "Cuba, with a Soviet-style command economy, has been unwilling to loosen restrictions on the private sector and open its economy to foreign investment, as many allies like Vietnam and China have urged it to do.",
      "Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn\u2019t happened this time around.",
      "\u201cToday, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government\u2019s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,\u201d Vidal said. \u201cIn the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.\u201d",

      "Protesters in Iran defied authorities Tuesday, hitting the streets in the capital, Tehran, and smaller cities to chant anti-government slogans amid an ongoing violent crackdown that one human rights group says has left at least 36 dead.",
      "The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy.",
      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 including 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar on Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for the demands of protesters to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement.",
      "But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian\u2019s efforts at mediation \u2014 and the killings and arrests by security forces \u2014 have not convinced the protesters to stay off the streets.",
      "\u201cThe system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cThe fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.\u201d",

      "Analysts say Trump\u2019s message fed into the conspiracy theories of the most hardline elements of the government, who were already on high alert for any foreign interference after a devastating 12-day war with Israel last summer, partly joined by the U.S. military, which left the country reeling.",
      "The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro \"a clear example of state terrorism\" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart on Saturday, according to the Iranian foreign ministry official website.",
      "\u201cWhat the threshold for U.S. intervention would be, or what it might look like, is not entirely clear but the leadership in Tehran is likely worried about the prospect of dealing with not just instability from below but military action from abroad,\u201d Vaez said.",
      "On Monday, the head of the judiciary, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, issued a clear warning: Legitimate protesters' demands would be heard, but those creating unrest would be dealt with harshly.",
      "\u201cThe main enemies of our people, meaning the American and Zionist regimes, in the current situation have officially and publicly supported chaos in our country,\u201d Mohseni-Ejei said, according to state media.",
      "He added: \u201cNow, there is no room for leniency for rioters and agitators.\u201d",
      "Some of the worst violence in recent days took place in the small town of Malekshahi and nearby Ilam in western Iran. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported that security forces opened fire on a crowd on Saturday, killing five people and wounding more than 40 others.",
      "In one video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, a crowd disperses quickly as multiple gunshots ring out and a handful of men return to pick up a man bleeding from a head wound.",
      "The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. One video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate.",
      "The U.S. State Department's Farsi language account on X posted a video of the security forces rushing into the Ilam hospital compound below text that read, \"Hospitals are not battlefields.\" The post also called the raid \"a crime.\"",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-vaccine-guidance-changes-children-pediatrician-visit-rcna252612",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:38:42 GMT",
    "summary": "For parents, visits to the pediatrician could bring new confusion now that the CDC has overhauled its recommended childhood vaccines.",
    "story": [
      "For parents of young children, visits to the pediatrician could involve new challenges and confusion now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has drastically overhauled its recommended childhood immunizations.",
      "The agency on Monday shortened the list of vaccines recommended for all children, dropping the number of diseases targeted from 18 to 11 \u2014 an unprecedented change that conflicts with guidance from medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The new schedule separates vaccines into three categories: universally recommended shots, vaccines for high-risk groups and vaccines recommended based on shared clinical decision-making between patients and doctors. Covid and flu shots, for example, now fall into that third category, while infant RSV shots are only recommended for high-risk groups.",
      "Many families are likely to have questions about which shots their kids are eligible for \u2014 with answers that are not always straightforward. The changes may require parents to track their children\u2019s immunization schedules more closely, rather than relying on reminders from a pediatrician. The overhaul is unlikely to affect insurance coverage, however.",
      "Here\u2019s what parents should know, according to interviews with doctors, infectious disease experts, insurance companies and health policy experts.",
      "How to know if a child meets the CDC criteria",
      "Under the new CDC guidance, vaccines that target 11 diseases are still universally recommended: those for measles, mumps and rubella; pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria; chickenpox; polio; pneumococcal disease; HPV; and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib).",
      "Recommendations changed, however, for vaccines targeting seven other diseases. Now, RSV shots are only recommended for high-risk groups. And the CDC says parents should consult with a health care provider about whether to get their child vaccinated for rotavirus, Covid and flu. Vaccines for hepatitis A and B, as well as for two types of bacterial meningitis, fall into both the high-risk and shared decision-making categories.",
      "For many parents, these changes raise new questions: How do I determine if my child is in the high-risk category? And can I still ensure my child gets the shots that are subject to shared decision-making?",
      "The answer to the second question is fairly straightforward: Any parent who wants their child to receive a particular shot should be able to get it as long as their doctor or pharmacist agrees to administer it. But for the first question, experts said it\u2019s often challenging to determine a child\u2019s risk level for an infection or illness \u2014 especially when it comes to RSV. Around 75% to 80% of infants hospitalized with RSV are otherwise healthy, with no underlying conditions.",
      "\u201cThere is no way to stratify who\u2019s at risk for RSV in this country,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University.",
      "In the fine print of its overhauled recommendations, the CDC suggests an initial RSV dose for infants under 8 months if their mothers did not get an RSV shot while pregnant, and a second dose for children with underlying issues like chronic lung disease. That\u2019s consistent with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Some doctors might not remind you about a child\u2019s next shots",
      "Many pediatricians still follow guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics; if so, they are likely to note when your child is eligible for vaccines that are no longer universally recommended by the CDC, such as flu shots. Pharmacies will also continue to have reminders online and in stores, said Dr. Brigid Groves, vice president of professional affairs at the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "But Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious diseases specialist at Stanford Medicine, said many doctors rely on an automated system that flags when a patient is due for a vaccine based on the CDC recommendations. The system does not flag vaccines that fall into the shared decision-making category, Scott said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s built for binary decisions \u2014 this patient needs this vaccine or they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a pathway for, \u2018Maybe. Discuss it.\u2019\u201d",
      "That could put greater onus on parents to stay on top of their child\u2019s immunizations.",
      "Vaccine supply and availability may change",
      "The altered vaccine recommendations could reduce demand for certain vaccines, which in turn might prompt some doctors\u2019 offices to order fewer doses.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if a lot of clinicians stop stocking the vaccines that are now under shared clinical decision-making,\u201d Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 committee on infectious diseases, said on a call with reporters on Monday.",
      "Lower vaccination coverage raises the risk that viruses will circulate",
      "Pediatricians worry that parents may assume, based on the new vaccine schedule, that certain lifesaving shots aren\u2019t useful, and will opt their children out.",
      "\u201cThe shift towards shared clinic decision-making will lead to dramatically lower uptake, and lower vaccine uptake leads to preventable illness and death,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Experts said the U.S. could see greater upticks in Covid or flu cases, or a resurgence of meningitis.",
      "Immunocompromised children are sometimes less protected by certain vaccines or ineligible to get them. If some school districts choose to follow the CDC\u2019s new schedule, it could mean more exposure to disease for these vulnerable kids, said Dr. Kelly Gebo, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.",
      "\u201cI worry now that we\u2019re entering a phase where we\u2019re going to have different recommendations in different states, and it\u2019s going to create chaos for children, for schools and for their parents,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurance should still cover vaccinations",
      "The Health and Human Services Department said that private and federal insurance programs will continue to cover all vaccines recommended under the CDC\u2019s previous childhood immunization schedule. Three major insurers confirmed to NBC News that such coverage would continue through the end of 2026.",
      "Aetna said it is covering all vaccinations recommended by the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel as of Sept. 1, 2025, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it will keep covering the immunizations recommended by the panel as of Jan. 1. (The panel\u2019s recommendation on Covid shots changed between those two dates.)",
      "UnitedHealthcare said it will also continue to cover childhood vaccines. Its coverage policy relies on guidance from the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "What to consider when making decisions with a health care provider",
      "Other than avoiding a few tears at the doctor\u2019s office, there\u2019s no reason for kids to get fewer shots than were previously recommended by the CDC, experts said.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others in the Trump administration have argued that children receive too many doses too early in life, and have drawn false links between early childhood vaccines and allergies or autism. However, experts say there are no safety concerns with the prior number of shots.",
      "\u201cThe number of antigens \u2014 the immune stimulating proteins that children are exposed to through vaccines \u2014 is such a tiny, tiny fraction of what their immune systems encounter on a regular basis,\u201d Scott said.",
      "\u201cThe science hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Groves said. \u201cThese vaccines are safe, they\u2019re effective, and they prevent disease and death.\u201d",
      "Another new decision for parents: How many doses of the HPV shot should preteens get?",
      "As part of its vaccine guideline overhaul, the CDC recommended that children ages 11 to 12 get one dose of the HPV vaccine instead of two or three.",
      "Recent clinical trials have suggested that one dose may be as effective as two at preventing human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer. However, the AAP continues to recommend two doses for kids ages 9 to 12, or three doses for teens who haven\u2019t started the series by age 15.",
      "O\u2019Leary said the American Academy of Pediatrics had been considering recommending one dose \u201cfor quite a while,\u201d but that there should be a transparent process for changing any such guidance."

Halligan, who unsuccessfully prosecuted former FBI Direct James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, is also referred to as U.S. attorney by the Justice Department in official documents.",
      "The judge's order is unusual because he issued it on his own, not at the request of defense attorneys. It came in a case involving a carjacking and attempted bank robbery suspect who was indicted last month.",
      "Novak gave Halligan seven days to respond in writing \u201cexplaining the basis for ... identification of herself as the United States Attorney, notwithstanding Judge Currie\u2019s contrary ruling.

      "In late November, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie found that the Justice Department had violated the Constitution by appointing Halligan as U.S. attorney. That finding led to the dismissal of criminal cases against Comey and James.",

      "Novak acknowledged Tuesday that the November ruling regarding Halligan\u2019s appointment had been appealed but said that since the order had not been paused, it remains the \u201cbinding precedent of the district and is not subject to being ignored.\u201d",

      "\"Stranger Things\" has concluded its nine-year run, ending its fifth and final season with a single episode out on the last day of 2025.",
      "Fans had a major reaction to the finale, which saw the defeat of the show's big bad, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) and launched our troop of Hawkins, Indiana teenagers into their futures.",
      "A redditor said they cried \"for an hour\" after the finale. Another called it an \"11/10 finale.\"",
      "A fan on Threads likened the finale to the feeling of becoming an adult: \"Perfect. No notes. For me, that\u2019s exactly what it felt like to grow up. Leaving a sacred portal in time before you\u2019re ready.\"",
      "But what exactly happens, and where does it leave Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown)? Here's what to know about the ambiguous ending.",
      "What Happens to Eleven in the 'Stranger Things' Finale?",
      "The episode's title, \"The Rightside Up,\" indicates what happens in the finale: Things are put, well, right, and that involves the closing of the Upside Down, the portal that opened in Season 1.",
      "Eleven and Will (Noah Schnapp) defeat Vecna. But there's more that needs to be done: The Upside Down itself needs to be destroyed.",
      "Eleven seems to understand her role in the next phase of the plan, but others in her life are resistant. \"I have to end the cycle,\" Eleven tells Hopper (David Harbour), her adoptive father.",
      "He's skeptical, delivering a speech about her deserving a better life. \"Life has been so unfair to you. So cruel. But you never let it break you. I need you to fight, kid,\" Hopper says.",
      "But Eleven decides to make her own choice. After Hopper creates a bomb to destroy the Upside Down, Eleven stands in the portal's doorway and refuses to budge.",
      "She visits her boyfriend, Mike (Finn Wolfhard), psychically before it detonates. \"None of this will ever end if I'm still here,\" she says. She continues later, \"I need you to help them understand my choice.\"",

      "After one last kiss in the psychic-verse, the gang looks on as Eleven sacrifices herself to the bomb that closes the Upside Down.",
      "Wait, But Does Eleven Really Die?",
      "Depends on who you ask.",
      "After the sequence, the episode cuts to the future. It's the day of high school graduation and Mike confesses to Hopper he's \"not OK\" with the idea of moving on from Eleven.",
      "So does he create a story that helps him cope with his new reality, or has he really picked up on an alternate explanation of Eleven's fate?",
      "At the end of the episode, the gang is back playing Dungeons and Dragons. Using their Dungeons and Dragons characters as stand-ins, Mike tells stories about all his friends and what happens to them next. The show then cuts to their futures, indicating that Mike got it right with his predictions.",
      "\"But there is a story he can never tell,\" Mike says. The story of the mage \u2014 Eleven's character As for the real story?",
      "According to Mike, Eleven and her sister, Kali, devised a plan to help her escape at the very last minute. \"She had to make everyone, including her friends, believe she was dead,\" Mike says.",
      "Kali cast an invisibility spell on Eleven, then an illusion spell making it seem like she had been swept up by the bomb. \"No one will ever know\" where Eleven went, Mike says, but \"I like to imagine she's in a beautiful land.\"",
      "The show cuts to Eleven walking through a landscape and finding a small town to live in. \"It is here, at last, that she finds peace,\" he says.",
      "Will asks, \"How do we know it's true?\"",
      "Mike responds, \"We don't. Not for sure. But I choose to believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Stranger Things\" fans have the same choice.",
      "What the Duffer Brothers Said About the Finale and Eleven's Fate",
      "\"There was never a version of the story where Eleven was hanging out with the gang at the end,\" Ross Duffer told Netflix's press site Tudum.",
      "Ross Duffer said Eleven's death, or disappearance, was integral to the story ending. Eleven represents childhood \u2014 and the finale is all about the kids of \u201cStranger Things\u201d growing up.",
      "\"For us and our writers, we didn\u2019t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away,\" Ross Duffer said.",
      "There was no way Eleven was going to carry out Hopper\u2019s dream of her becoming a \u201cregular\u201d girl, essentially.",
      "The Duffer brothers aren't ruling out whether she's alive, but confirm she's not coming back to the kids of Hawkins. That's the power of Mike's story, which allows her to remain a presence in their lives.",
      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Days after Venezuela\u2019s capital was rocked by explosions and the country\u2019s leader was seized in a U.S. operation, the streets of this city were eerily quiet.",
      "Few people are venturing from their homes, although businesses have begun to reopen and the long lines that had snaked outside the few pharmacies and supermarkets that were operational over the weekend are disappearing. Those trying to get to work using the public bus system seem to be struggling as it seems to be on a skeleton schedule.",
      "The more than half a dozen people who spoke to NBC News said that there has been an increased presence of government security forces as well as armed civilian paramilitaries loyal to the government. Officials have called for the arrest of anyone involved in the weekend\u2019s attack. For those who quietly oppose the Maduro government, they hope they\u2019re finally seeing the end of a dark period of their history. For those who supported him, there\u2019s the uncertainty of what will happen to their leader.",
      "Daniel, a gardener who commutes from his home on the outskirts of Caracas to the upscale neighborhood of Altamira, said he stayed home on Monday because he was afraid of encountering pro-government groups that are widely reported to be checking people\u2019s cellphones. Like everyone interviewed for this story, Daniel asked not to be fully identified out of fear of reprisal from authorities that are very much still in power.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Daniel said he was hopeful that sooner or later Venezuelans would have a country where they could express themselves freely and choose their own leaders.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t deny that the future makes me anxious, but I do trust that change can happen from now on,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "After an extraordinary weekend \u2014 when the country\u2019s authoritarian leader and his wife, Nicolas Maduro and Cilia Flores, were seized by U.S. special forces and American bombs rained down on military facilities, ports and power installations \u2014 the regime appears to be holding firm. President Donald Trump has made clear as of now that he supports the leadership of Maduro\u2019s vice president and successor, Delcy Rodriguez, who has said she is willing to work with the United States.",
      "Still, intractable issues remain. The government continues to be willing to use intimidation and violence to remain in power and shows few signs of trying to fix an economy that has trapped 90% of the population in poverty despite the country\u2019s vast oil wealth. Hundreds of people are still in prison after they were arrested during protests following the July 2024 election, where there was credible evidence Maduro\u2019s opposition won.",
      "On Sunday morning, Josefina and her husband, both 70-year-old retirees, were driving along Boyac\u00e1 Avenue, a highway that carves an east-to-west path across Caracas alongside Waraira Repano National Park. The road is popular on weekends when families take in the views of nature surrounding the city.",
      "What was supposed to have been a relaxing weekend outing turned nerve-wracking when the couple encountered a checkpoint. At first they thought it was \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the Venezuelan government. Instead, a black van carrying the insignia of the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence, which is responsible for stopping espionage and intelligence threats, was parked behind the men.",
      "\u201cThey were dressed in civilian clothes and were heavily armed,\u201d Josefina said.",
      "Josefina and her husband got home fine since they likely are not seen as a threat to a government that is on highest alert. But on Monday, near the National Assembly around the time Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president, 14 journalists and press workers were detained. \u200bThirteen journalists have been released and one was deported, according to a local journalists\u2019 group.",
      "Some residents said they were afraid of the possibility of another U.S. attack.",
      "Rosa, a 47-year-old optometrist who lives and works in eastern Caracas, said that while she was happy about Maduro\u2019s capture, she would never forget the terror she experienced early Saturday.",
      "\u201cI would never want to live through something like that again in my life,\u201d she said, describing how at 2 a.m. an explosion woke her up. \u201cThe windows of my house shook as if there were an earthquake. It was so strong that my neighbor\u2019s windows cracked.\u201d",
      "Germari, 26, a graduate in foreign trade who lives near one of the military bases attacked on Saturday, echoed that sentiment.",
      "\u201cMy mother, my sister, and I have been sleeping together since that day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t rested because even the sound of cars frightens us. My biggest worry is that it will happen again.\u201d",

It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",

      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\" he said. \"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,\" Miller added.",

      "While some are drawing parallels between the United States\u2019 dramatic action in Venezuela and China\u2019s ambitions for Taiwan, experts say Beijing is less concerned about the self-ruled island\u2019s sovereignty and instead views the attack as an opportunity to undermine America\u2019s global leadership.",
      "As the Trump administration withdraws from global institutions and upends long-standing norms, Beijing has sought to cast itself as the true champion of the rules-based international order. Chinese state media commentaries on the Venezuela attack argue that the U.S. is now one of the biggest threats to that order, and that its actions have undermined its credibility in Latin America.",
      "\u201cThis is a country which just behaved like a hegemon, right?\u201d said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cHow can you trust a country that would deal with its weak neighbors this way?\u201d",

      "Latin American countries may feel pressured \u201cto be more cautious in dealing with China on the economic front in the future,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview. \u201cAnd also for the Chinese business community, they see not just uncertainty but rising risk from this region.\u201d",

      "The U.S. attack on Venezuela has also raised fears that it could embolden China to move against Taiwan, the self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary.",
      "And for some users on China\u2019s heavily censored social media, Trump\u2019s assertion that the U.S. was \u201cin charge\u201d after Maduro was captured was a source of inspiration.",

      "But Venezuela and Taiwan are \u201ctwo different issues,\u201d according to Wu at Fudan University. \u201cVenezuela is an independent sovereign state, and Taiwan is part of China,\u201d he said, adding that China prefers \u201ca peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue.\u201d",
      "The events in Venezuela will not \u201cdramatically alter Beijing\u2019s calculus on Taiwan,\u201d said Ryan Hass, director of Brookings\u2019 John L. Thornton China Center, adding that China will focus on protecting its interests in Latin America.",

      "The U.S. military\u2019s ability to carry out a Maduro-style \u201cdecapitation strike,\u201d especially against Venezuela\u2019s largely Chinese defense systems, could make Beijing think twice about testing its military against Washington\u2019s, Sung said via a messaging app.",

      "In the wake of the extraordinary U.S. capture of Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the international spotlight has fallen on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the country\u2019s interim leader and a key player in an explosive geopolitical drama.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "In an Instagram post on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",

      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",

      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",

      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",

      "CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland \u2014 Ringing in the new year with a night of drinking and dancing high in the Swiss Alps, Ebenezer Mehari, 17, decided to take a breather outside the packed Constellation Bar.",
      "As he turned to go back inside, he told NBC News at the scene Friday, \u201chell\u201d erupted as a deadly fire broke out. \u201cI heard a big boom, and everybody was screaming,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety.",
      "His friends were not so lucky, he says. \u201cI have four friends who died,\u201d he said, still struggling to process the loss. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not real.\u201d",
      "Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off.",
      "\u201cSomebody was dying in front of me and I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHer face was so burned it was red.\u201d",
      "The bar was popular with local teenagers, he said. The legal drinking age is 16 in Switzerland.",
      "Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. \u201cI tried to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari\u2019s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require \u201cmonths of rehabilitation\u201d and even have \u201clifelong consequences.\u201d",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. \u201cI am still alive and it\u2019s just stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d",
      "Samuel Rapp said he was at a restaurant next door when the fire broke out.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were screaming and it was horrible,\u201d Rapp told NBC News\u2019 British broadcasting partner Sky News. \u201cPeople were walking on everybody,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201csaw a lot of people on the floor, and I think these people were dead because someone put jackets on their faces.\u201d",
      "Laetitia Place, 17, said she was caught up in the chaos.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI was so scared \u2014 scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cWe all saw really horrible things that no one should ever have to see.\u201d",
      "Eric Bonvin, the general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment.",
      "The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital.",
      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",
      "\u201cThere were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That\u2019s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,\u201d Bonvin said.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to live through for everyone. Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, \u2018Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?\u2019 This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,\u201d Bonvin said. \u201cAlso, seeing young people arrive \u2014 that\u2019s always traumatic.\u201d",
      "The road to recovery for the gravely injured will likely be long and arduous, he cautioned.",

      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 including 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar on Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for the demands of protesters to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement.",
      "But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian\u2019s efforts at mediation \u2014 and the killings and arrests by security forces \u2014 have not convinced the protesters to stay off the streets.",
      "\u201cThe system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cThe fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.\u201d",

      "Analysts say Trump\u2019s message fed into the conspiracy theories of the most hardline elements of the government, who were already on high alert for any foreign interference after a devastating 12-day war with Israel last summer, partly joined by the U.S. military, which left the country reeling.",
      "The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro \"a clear example of state terrorism\" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart on Saturday, according to the Iranian foreign ministry official website.",

      "On Monday, the head of the judiciary, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, issued a clear warning: Legitimate protesters' demands would be heard, but those creating unrest would be dealt with harshly.",
      "\u201cThe main enemies of our people, meaning the American and Zionist regimes, in the current situation have officially and publicly supported chaos in our country,\u201d Mohseni-Ejei said, according to state media.",

      "The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. One video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate.",

      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Content creator Pedro Luis Garc\u00eda said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity.

    "story": [
      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for more than a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "\"We have to fix the country first. You can\u2019t have an election. There\u2019s no way the people could even vote,\" Trump said about the possibility of a vote in the next month. \"No, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. We have \u2014 we have to nurse the country back to health.\"",
      "Moreover, he said, the U.S. may subsidize an effort by oil companies to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure \u2014 a project he said could take less than 18 months.",
      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" he said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\"",
      "He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.",
      "\"No, we\u2019re not,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re at war with people that sell drugs. We\u2019re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\"",
      "In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials \u2014 including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who will help oversee America\u2019s involvement in Venezuela.",
      "\"It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,\" he said.",
      "But he had a one-word answer for who is ultimately in charge: \u201cMe.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s discussion of his vision for Venezuela came just a couple of hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on a series of charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials.",
      "Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in Monday as his successor.",
      "Trump said Rodr\u00edguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster.",
      "\"No, that\u2019s not the case,\" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodr\u00edguez will be left in place or lifted.",
      "When asked if there was \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied, \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle.",
      "Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodr\u00edguez yet, but he said that Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong.\"",
      "He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already.",
      "\"We\u2019re prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\"",
      "Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year \u2014 an award long sought by Trump.",
      "\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"",
      "Having campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.",
      "But he said in the interview that he is confident his political base will stick with him.",
      "\"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\" Trump said. \"MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"",
      "Critics in both parties have noted that Trump did not seek a new authorization from Congress to launch Saturday morning's raid, and he said in the interview that he would not need lawmakers to act in order for him to send American troops back in.",
      "\"We have good support congressionally,\" he said. \"And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?\"",
      "When asked what Congress \"knew\" \u2014 and whether any lawmakers had advance notification about the operation \u2014 Trump declined to elaborate.",

      "By capturing Venezuela\u2019s president, Washington sent shock waves felt far beyond Caracas.",
      "The United States stunned the world on Saturday by launching military strikes in Venezuela and seizing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, swiftly ending his 13-year rule in an operation the Trump administration framed as a demonstration of American power, as President Donald Trump boasted that the U.S. possessed \u201ccapabilities and skills our enemies can scarcely imagine.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s adversaries heard him loudest.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Russia and China swiftly condemned the strikes and called for the release of Maduro, who has been brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. Iran and Cuba denounced what they called a violation of international law, their objections carrying an edge of unease that they, too, could find themselves in Washington\u2019s sights.",
      "Even major European allies, more cautious and measured in tone, carefully signaled concern about the operation\u2019s legality while largely aligning with the U.S. on policy.",
      "Taken together, these responses suggest the revival of old fears of American interventionism, prompting allies and adversaries alike to ponder where Washington might act next.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to \"demolish foreign drug cartels\" by going after Maduro. She said on X that the operation would \"keep our citizens safe\" in keeping with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",
      "For Tehran, the fall of a close ally comes as it grapples with internal unrest of its own, just a day after Trump warned Iran it could face U.S. action if protesters were harmed.",
      "\u201cThe American military attack on Venezuela is a clear violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and the fundamental rules of international law,\u201d it said in a statement published on Telegram by Iran\u2019s semiofficial news agency.",
      "In Havana, Cuba\u2019s leadership labeled the attack \u201cstate terrorism,\u201d acutely aware that both Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have openly questioned how long the Cuban government itself should remain untouched.",
      "Rubio\u2019s \u201cprimary interest is in Cuba, not in Venezuela,\u201d said Michael Paarlberg, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, noting that Rubio sees Venezuela \u201cas the chief patron of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Asked Sunday during an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether the Trump administration\u2019s next target is the Cuban government, Rubio said, \u201cThe Cuban government is a huge problem.\u201d",
      "He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are at war against drug trafficking organizations, it's not a war against Venezuela,\u201d Rubio said of the intervention. \u201cWe are enforcing American laws with regards to oil sanctions.\u201d",
      "While past U.S. regime-change efforts in Cuba have failed, dating back decades, Paarlberg told NBC News the Cuban government was still likely to be \u201cworried about something like a direct parallel.\u201d",
      "The United States\u2019 traditional adversaries were not alone in their condemnation, with several left-leaning governments in Latin America warning the move risked destabilizing the region.",
      "Brazil said the U.S. had crossed an \u201cunacceptable line,\u201d warning the attack set an \u201cextremely dangerous precedent for the international community.\u201d Other democratic leaders in the region, including Colombia\u2019s Gustavo Petro, Mexico\u2019s Claudia Sheinbaum and Chile\u2019s Gabriel Boric, joined in denouncing the U.S. intervention.",
      "Legal experts also questioned the operation\u2019s legality.",
      "The use of military force to remove Venezuela\u2019s president is effectively a \u201ckidnapping\u201d and violates core principles of the United Nations Charter, said Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, a professor at Notre Dame Law School.",
      "\u201cIf you detain someone unlawfully, if you take someone into your custody and you do not have the legal right to do that, then what else would you call it?\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe U.N. Charter makes it very clear that there are very few times when a country has the right to carry out military force on the territory of another country,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it never has the right to do that in order to bring an individual out to stand trial before their courts.\u201d",
      "Many European allies struck a careful balance, nodding to international law but without dissent in an effort to avoid upsetting the U.S.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country would \u201cshed no tears\u201d about the end of Maduro\u2019s regime before reiterating his \u201csupport for international law,\u201d without saying what that support entails.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation \u201ccomplex,\u201d and said his country \u201cwill take our time,\u201d to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that \u201cany solution must respect international law and the U.N. Charter.\u201d",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the military operation in Venezuela \u201ccontravenes the principle of non-use of force, which underpins international law,\u201d while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said it violated international law.",
      "But as reactions to the Venezuela strike fell largely along predictable lines, the precedent it sets has left others wondering how vulnerable they might be, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "\u201cEuropean countries were counting on the U.S. and certain types of U.S. behavior that perhaps they can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d he said, noting that Denmark had been careful in its response because \u201cthey know that Greenland is in the firing line.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of buying or taking Greenland, treating the Danish territory as a strategic asset for the U.S. in the Arctic.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, on Saturday shared what he said was a \u201cfriendly reminder\u201d on X that \u201cwe expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\u201d pushing back at Trump-aligned figures who had raised the issue in the wake of the Venezuela strike.",
      "Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, \u201chave very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.\u201d Europe, he said, was \u201cexpressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,\u201d raising the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of invoking a system that isn\u2019t backed by the strongest power in the world?\u201d",
      "But recent history shows that even as the rules-based order struggles, the U.S. has frequently acted unilaterally, with the Venezuela strike reflecting enduring patterns of intervention in Latin America, according to retired Col. Gregory A. Daddis.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, U.S. actions in Venezuela follow a long history of American interventionism in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere we have argued that the Western Hemisphere, in its entirety, falls within our jurisdiction to protect U.S. interests.\u201d"

      "The protests erupted Sunday in the capital, Tehran, with crowds largely chanting about economic grievances after the country's currency hit a record low against the dollar as prices soar.",

A water crisis also led to taps running dry at times late last year.",

      "The fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland and left 40 dead, appears to have started when sparklers atop bottles were brought too close to the ceiling, Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton Attorney General, told a news conference Friday after preliminary investigations.",
      "The sparklers appear to have led to \u201cwhat is referred to as a flashover incident where the fire spread very rapidly,\u201d she said. Investigators would assess soundproofing foam used in the ceiling, and whether anyone needs to be held criminally liable for the fire, she added.",

      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",
