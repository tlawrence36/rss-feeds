      "Wayne Osmond, a singer, guitarist and founding member of the million-selling family act The Osmonds, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Wayne Osmond, a singer, guitarist and founding member of the million-selling family act The Osmonds, who were known for such 1970s teen hits as \u201cOne Bad Apple,\" \"Yo-Yo\" and \u201cDown By the Lazy River,\u201d has died. He was 73.",
      "Sibling Merrill Osmond posted on his Facebook page that Wayne died this week at a Salt Lake City hospital after suffering a \u201cmassive stroke.\u201d",
      "\u201cI've never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolutely no guile,\u201d Merrill wrote. \u201cAn individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.\u201d",
      "Wayne Osmond was the fourth oldest of nine children raised in a Mormon household in Ogden, Utah, and the second oldest among the musical performers. The siblings' career began in the 1950s when Wayne, Alan, Merrill and Jay sang as a barbershop quartet.",
      "Their popularity grew in the 1960s after being supported by singer Andy Williams, and they peaked as a quintet in the early 1970s, with younger brother Donny Osmond the breakout star. \u201cOne Bad Apple\u201d and other songs were often compared to the music of The Osmonds' contemporaries, the Jackson 5, and Donny was positioned as the white counterpart to the Jacksons' lead singer, Michael Jackson.",
      "The Osmonds' popularity faded by the mid-1970s, although Donny and Marie Osmond both enjoyed successful careers as solo performers and as a brother-sister duo.",
      "In the 1980s, Wayne Osmond regrouped with Alan, Merrill and Jay as a country act and had a handful of hits, including \u201cI Think About Your Lovin.'\u201d",
      "But in the mid-1990s he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost much of his hearing from the surgery and treatment. A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful life. And you know, being able to hear is not all that it\u2019s cracked up to be, it really isn\u2019t,\u201d he told the Deseret News in 2018. \u201cMy favorite thing now is to take care of my yard. I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it\u2019s really joyful.\u201d",
      "Wayne Osmond married Kathlyn White in 1974. They had five children.",

      "\u201cA positive identification of the remains cannot be made at this time pending autopsy results and further investigation,\u201d state police said on X.",
      "Investigators were sent Monday to a wooded area near Rothbury in Oceana County, site of the popular Electric Forest music festival. Forensic anthropologists from Western Michigan University also joined the effort.",

      "\u201cThey said they found his wallet, his phone, and he had a (festival) wristband on,\u201d Gary Graves said of police. \u201cThey just got to do an autopsy and dental records and everything and then they\u2019ll get back with us.\u201d",
      "Police in 2018 searched the area with dogs and dozens of volunteers, while divers checked area lakes. In 2023, a billboard with Graves' picture urged festival visitors to call police with any tips.",

    "story": [
      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

      "Actor Blake Lively has sued the director of the film \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d alleging harassment on the set and a coordinated campaign to smear her reputation",
      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that \u201cthe New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful \u2018untouchable\u2019 Hollywood elites.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",
      "\u201cAs long as we\u2019re telling good stories, entertaining and compelling stories with compelling characters, we\u2019ll keep going,\u201d he said.",

      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "Shyer died in Los Angeles on Friday, his daughter, filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer told The Associated Press on Sunday. No cause was disclosed.",
      "A son of Hollywood, whose father Melville Shyer was one of the founding members of the Directors Guild of America, Shyer made an indelible mark on comedies, mostly of the romantic persuasion, in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Born in Los Angeles in 1941, Shyer cut his teeth writing for television, assisting Garry Marshall and working on shows like \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d before transitioning to films. He had writing credits on \u201cSmokey and the Bandit,\u201d Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cGoin\u2019 South\u201d and the Walter Matthau drama \u201cHouse Calls.\u201d A big breakthrough came with \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d the Goldie Hawn comedy about a wealthy woman who inadvertently signs up for basic training, which he co-wrote with Meyers and Harvey Miller.",
      "It was a script that was initially turned down by every studio in Hollywood, even with Hawn attached to star and produce.",
      "\u201cWe went to a meeting at Paramount after they read the script, and Mike Eisner was the president of the studio, and we sat in his office with Mike and (producer) Don Simpson. And Mike said to Goldie, \u2018This is a mistake for you to make this movie,\u2019\u201d Shyer told Indiewire in 2022. \u201cGod bless Don Simpson who spoke up and said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re 100% wrong on this one.\u2019\u201d",
      "The movie became one of the biggest hits of 1980. It got them an Oscar nomination and a win from the Writers Guild and also paved the way for his directorial debut \u201cIrreconcilable Differences.\u201d",
      "That film, which he also wrote with Meyers (they married in 1980), starred Shelley Long and Ryan O\u2019Neal as a writing-directing duo whose relationship crumbles after success and an infatuation with a young actor played by Sharon Stone. It was partially inspired by the tabloid affairs of Peter Bogdanovich, who left his wife and producer Polly Platt for Cybill Shepherd.",
      "\u201cNancy and I just laughed at the same things. We love the same movies, we kind of educate each other on the movies that each of us loved,\u201d Shyer told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd Nancy really made me laugh. I think she wrote the best one-liners of anybody I know, except Neil Simon. And, and we were just always in sync \u2014 as filmmakers, we had this thing.\u201d",
      "They followed with \u201cBaby Boom,\u201d in which Diane Keaton plays a working woman who suddenly has to care for a baby, and \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d which reimagined Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1950 film for the 1990s with Keaton, Steve Martin and Martin Short leading the comedic ensemble. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel.",
      "Shyer and Meyers' last collaboration as a married couple before divorcing in 1999 was the remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d with Lindsay Lohan, which Meyers directed and Shyer co-wrote and produced. Their daughters Annie and Hallie, whose names were used for Lohan\u2019s twin characters, both appeared in the film. Shyer is also survived by two children, Jacob and Sophia, from a subsequent marriage that ended in divorce.",
      "While Shyer often found himself doing remakes, he and Meyers never wanted to do \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of the originals and always endeavored to put their own stamp on their films. But even he was surprised by the longevity of some of them, remembering an old Billy Wilder quote that \u201ccomedy is not like fine wine, it does not age well.\u201d But, he said, they tried to avoid the temptation to include too many timely references.",
      "\u201cYou try to write things that are not basically of the moment, especially in comedy,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cTry to write stories about human beings that will reflect on today and tomorrow and yesterday.\u201d",
      "Shyer went on to remake \u201cAlfie,\u201d with Jude Law, and the Hilary Swank period drama \u201cThe Affair of the Necklace,\u201d neither of which did well at the box office. He also directed the Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte movie \u201cI Love Trouble,\u201d the only film of his that he admitted he didn't like.",
      "Other films never saw the light of day: He spent a year and a half prepping \u201cEloise in Paris\u201d but it was canceled when the production company suddenly went out of business.",
      "He stepped away from directing for many years but returned in recent years with two Netflix Christmas romantic comedies: \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d and \u201cBest. Christmas. Ever!\u201d",
      "\u201cI just gravitated towards stuff I like,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a James Bond movie. I\u2019ve never seen one. I never liked science-fiction movies. \u2026 I like movies about people, and I want them to have substance.\u201d",
      "Shyer had told Indiewire that he was working on a script he'd been thinking about for decades, since he was hospitalized briefly at 17. He described the movie as a cross between \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d And retirement, he said at the time, was not in the cards.",
      "\u201cWhat am I going to do? Garden?\u201d he said. \u201cI just have a lot of energy. I want to keep going. I actually love the process and I love the camaraderie. I love what I do. If I drop dead, maybe it will be holding a camera.\u201d"

      "Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while \u201cMufasa\u201d brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to \u201cWicked,\u201d which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It\u2019s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.",

      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "title": "Psychedelic therapy begins in Colorado, causing tension between conservatives and veterans",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
    "story": [
      "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Colorado becomes the second state to legalize psychedelic therapy this week, a clash is playing out in Colorado Springs, where conservative leaders are restricting the treatment over objections from some of the city's 90,000 veterans, who've become flagbearers for psychedelic therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Colorado residents voted to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the chemical compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, in a 2022 ballot measure, launching two years of rulemaking before it could be used to treat conditions such as depression and PTSD.",
      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",

      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines.

      "",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "Tehran issued the warning to the Italian ambassador to Iran, Paola Amadei, who was summoned to the foreign ministry, the official IRNA news agency reported. The meeting took place a day after Italy summoned the Iranian ambassador over the detention of an Italian journalist in Tehran.",

      "Mohammad Abedini was arrested by Italian authorities at Milan\u2019s Malpensa airport on Dec. 16 on a U.S. warrant.

      "As a result, all eyes will be on the Milan court of appeals, which scheduled a hearing for Jan. 15 to decide whether to keep Abedini at Milan\u2019s Opera prison or grant him house arrest pending the start of the lengthy extradition process to the U.S.",
      "The U.S. government hasn't commented publicly on Abedini's petition, but in the past it has complained to Italy's justice ministry about a half-dozen cases of suspects wanted by the U.S. who escaped from the Italian justice system before they could be extradited.",
      "On Friday, Abedini's lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco visited his client in prison and said he had asked him about Sala. He said Abedini had heard about Sala\u2019s case inside the prison and didn\u2019t understand any connection to him.",
      "\u201cHe asked me if she had been arrested and how she had been arrested, and why in some way they wanted to connect her to him,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cI explained the situation to him, even what is said on television, because it is useless to deny it, but I explained to him.\u201d",
      "The lawyer stressed that on the surface the two cases are separate but said Abedini was emotional in hearing about her plight.",
      "\u201cHe asked me to write the name of Cecilia Sala on a piece of paper we had with pen, so that he could correctly pronounce her name,\u201d De Francesco told reporters outside the prison. \u201cHe was very moved by this thing, to know that she is a woman in prison right now, and so he prays for her, for him.\u201d",
      "U.S. federal prosecutors charged Abedini and his co-defendant with export control violations after FBI specialists analyzed the drone navigation system used in the Jordan attack and traced it to them. U.S. prosecutors said Abedini\u2019s Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",
      "Iran\u2019s embassy to Italy has connected Sala\u2019s fate to that of Abedini, saying in a statement posted to X that it will respect Sala\u2019s rights and expects Italy to do the same for Abedini.",
      "The delicate diplomatic triangle poses something of a headache for the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni, which is still stinging from the embarrassment of having lost track of another high-profile target wanted by the U.S.",
      "Russian businessman Artyom Uss, wanted by the U.S. on alleged sanctions violations, escaped from Italy in 2022 after he was granted house arrest, despite warnings from the U.S. that he was a flight risk.",
      "Uss, the son of a Russian regional governor, later resurfaced in Russia. Meloni acknowledged at the time that there were grave \u201canomalies\u201d in the handling of his case and ordered an investigation.",
      "Milan\u2019s general prosecutor, Francesca Nanni, has opposed Abedini\u2019s motion for house arrest, saying he\u2019s a flight risk and that not even guarantees from Iran\u2019s consulate in Milan were sufficient to ensure he wouldn\u2019t disappear.",
      "The issue could come up next week when Meloni hosts President Joe Biden on his final foreign trip before leaving office.",
      "Traditionally, Iran has enjoyed calm diplomatic relations with Italy compared to other European nations such as Britain, France and Germany. Those countries routinely accuse Tehran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia and producing weapon-grade uranium, charges Iran denies.",

      "A senior British minister has pushed back on Elon Musk\u2019s criticism of the government's handling of a historic child grooming scandal",
      "LONDON -- A senior British politician pushed back Friday on Elon Musk's criticism of the government's handling of a historic child grooming scandal.",
      "In recent days, Musk has shared and reacted to posts on his X platform that have been critical of the British government after it rejected a call for a public inquiry into the grooming scandal in the north of England town of Oldham.",
      "Though Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's views were was \"misjudged and certainly misinformed,\u201d he urged the world's richest man and close confidant of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to work with the government on tackling the issue of child sexual exploitation.",
      "The government has argued that Oldham must follow in the footsteps of other towns and commission its own inquiry into the historical abuse of mainly girls.",
      "A 2022 report into safeguarding measures in Oldham between 2011 and 2014 found that children were failed by local agencies, but that there was no cover-up despite \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d that the far-right would capitalize on \u201cthe high-profile convictions of predominantly Pakistani offenders across the country.\"",
      "Musk has also targeted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who he claimed had failed to bring what many term \u201crape gangs\u201d to justice when he was the director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. The scandals, Musk said Friday, represent a \u201cmassive crime against humanity.\u201d",
      "Streeting told ITV News that the government took child sexual exploitation \u201cincredibly seriously\u201d and that it was supportive of an inquiry into the Oldham scandal, but that it should be led locally.",
      "\u201cSome of the criticisms that Elon Musk has made, I think are misjudged and certainly misinformed, but we\u2019re willing to work with Elon Musk, who I think has got a big role to play with his social media platform to help us and other countries to tackle this serious issue,\" Streeting said. \"So if he wants to work with us and roll his sleeves up, we\u2019d welcome that.\u201d",
      "Musk has been, it seems, taking a keen interest in the U.K. political scene since the left-of-center Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July 2024, to bring an end to 14 years of Conservative rule.",
      "Musk has retweeted criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir \u2013 shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has \u201ctwo-tier policing,\u201d with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators.",
      "Musk has also compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation to the Soviet Union, while during summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. he tweeted that \u201ccivil war is inevitable.\u201d",
      "Musk also backed calls Friday for a U.K. general election, barely six months after the last one. \u201cThe people of Britain do not want this government at all. New elections,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He has also recently expressed his support for Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, the founder of the far-right English Defense League, who is better known as Tommy Robinson and who is serving an 18-month jail term for contempt of court.",
      "As well as offering his thoughts, Musk is apparently interested in putting his money where his mouth is by funding Reform U.K., a right-wing party led by Nigel Farage, who is Trump\u2019s highest-profile British champion, to the tune of 100 million pounds ($124 million).",

      "The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since Ghana launched the \u201cYear of the Return\u201d program, aimed at attracting the Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619.",
      "Ghana\u2019s Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have extended the program into \u201cBeyond the Return,\u201d which fosters the relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship, including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica.",
      "Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease they didn\u2019t have in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWhen we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates trauma,\u201d she said.",
      "She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14.",
      "Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11, and the family\u2019s dog, Apollo.",
      "\u201cIn America, being a Black male with locs who\u2019s very tall for his age, he is treated like a threat,\u201d Bowers said.",
      "Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship signified more than simply living in Ghana.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t need (citizenship) to tell me that I\u2019m African. Anywhere that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I\u2019m melanated,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those ancestors who never made it back,\" she said, \u201cthat passport, for me, is for them.\u201d",
      "Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from West and Central Africa.",
      "Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main point of departure.",
      "As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible. From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the \u201cDoor of No Return,\" haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time.",
      "The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering.",
      "Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them.",
      "\u201cI first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans, African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,\u201d she said.",
      "She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck, Deijha Vu\u2019s Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food.",
      "Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch.",
      "Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship.",
      "\u201cIt just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don\u2019t have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection here, I feel like I\u2019ve done something right,\u201d she said.",
      "Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and asking about the citizenship process.",
      "The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a concession from Ghana's presidency, a process made legal under the 2000 Citizenship Act. It's granted to those residing in Ghana who have told the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in citizenship.",
      "Ghana's government in part describes the program as a benefit to the economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to relocate.",
      "Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real benefits of citizenship are intangible.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a gold mine, or they\u2019ve found oil or some kind of business opportunity. But it\u2019s something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price on,\u201d he said.",
      "President Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s administration, which launched the \u201cYear of the Return,\u201d is on its way out. Ghana\u2019s main opposition party won the presidential election on Dec. 7.",
      "But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession.",
      "Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents' ceremony.",
      "Bowers\u2019 father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the Rastafari faith. \u201cPart of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this earth,\u201d she said.",
      "She believes that her father is proud of her. \u201cI really feel like he\u2019s smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so he\u2019s experiencing it through me.\u201d",

    "summary": "The rockets from Gaza have mostly fallen silent",
    "story": [
      "The rockets from Gaza have mostly fallen silent",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The rockets from Gaza have mostly fallen silent. A ceasefire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon has taken hold. But repeated fire from Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, a faraway foe, is proving a stubborn threat for Israel.",
      "The Iran-backed Houthis are stepping up their missile attacks, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis scrambling for shelter in the middle of the night, scaring away foreign airlines and keeping up what could be the last major front in the Middle East wars.",
      "\u201cIt's like musical chairs,\u201d said Yoni Yovel, 31, who left the northern Israeli city of Haifa late last year to avoid rocket fire from Hezbollah only to see his apartment in Tel Aviv\u2019s Jaffa neighborhood heavily damaged by a Houthi missile.",
      "Israel has repeatedly bombarded ports, oil infrastructure and the airport in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa, some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away. Israeli leaders have threatened to kill central Houthi figures and have tried to galvanize the world against the threat.",
      "But the Houthis persist. In recent weeks, missiles and drones from Yemen have struck nearly every day, including early Friday morning, setting off air raid sirens in broad swaths of Israel. In some cases, the projectiles have penetrated Israel\u2019s sophisticated aerial defense system, most recently toppling an empty school and shattering the windows of apartments near an empty playground where one missile landed.",
      "Because most missiles are intercepted and because the fire is usually a single missile at a time, the strikes have not caused major physical damage, although a few attacks have been fatal during the 15-month war in Gaza as the Houthis attack in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "But the rocket fire is posing a threat to Israel\u2019s economy, keeping many foreign airlines away and preventing the country from jump-starting its hard-hit tourism industry.",
      "Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have all but shuttered an Israeli port in the city of Eilat and have prompted ships destined for it to take a longer, more costly route around Africa to Israel's Mediterranean ports.",
      "The Houthi strikes are also a symbolic reminder for Israel of the Iran-backed enemies that encircle it, known as the \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d and the last major holdout. And because Israel\u2019s counterstrikes have yet to deter the Houthis, their persistent attacks defy Israel\u2019s image as a regional military powerhouse.",
      "\u201cThey are the only ones who are active now,\u201d said Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank.",
      "The Houthis, he said, \u201care a challenge of a different kind.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Hamas launched its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Houthis began striking Israel-linked ships in the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait along Yemen\u2019s coast. Those attacks expanded to include other ships with no ties to Israel, disrupting cargo and energy shipments that are critical for worldwide trade. The Houthis said it was part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza.",
      "In response, U.S. and partner forces have launched multiple rounds of coordinated airstrikes against Houthi launch sites and weapons storage sites.",
      "Throughout the war, the Houthis have also been firing missiles and drones at Israel, at first focusing on Eilat and eventually broadening attacks to include major population centers and the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. The launches have intensified in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cThere was thunder the other night and my daughter thought it was a missile. She woke up and started screaming,\u201d said Ibrahim Sosa, 53, whose home in Jaffa is near the site of a recent missile landing.",
      "Israel has retaliated repeatedly and vowed to escalate if the attacks don't stop.",
      "\u201cWe will hunt down all of the Houthis' leaders and we will strike them just as we have done in other places,\" said Defense Minister Israel Katz, shortly after Israeli jets struck Yemen last week.",
      "The Israeli strikes have been deadly, with several people killed. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told The Associated Press that Israel\u2019s strikes focused on \u201cmilitary infrastructure which was used and directly contributed to Houthi terror activities, including to smuggle arms and finance their terror activities.\"",
      "Hagari acknowledged the battle would be complex. And despite massive Israeli air power, the Houthis have continued their assaults. That stands in contrast to Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran \u2014 three other enemies Israel has largely neutralized over the past 15 months.",
      "\u201cIsrael has many years of familiarity with those enemies. There is intelligence and there is the important element of a ground maneuver, and in Yemen we can't do that. The scale here is different,\u201d said Eyal Pinko, a former Israeli defense official and senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think tank.",
      "Yemen does not border Israel, and Israel cannot easily stage a ground invasion as it has in Gaza and Lebanon to dismantle enemies\u2019 infrastructure. Israel has to orchestrate complex air missions to fly to Yemen, which are costly and limited in what they can achieve.",
      "Pinko also said the Houthis have learned over years of fighting against a Saudi-led coalition how to bounce back from airstrikes.",
      "While the Houthis have been active as an insurgent force for years, Israel hasn\u2019t seen them as a priority or invested as much in gathering intelligence against them.",
      "Against Hamas, yearslong intelligence helped target and erode the group's forces. With Hezbollah, Israel penetrated deep into the organization, allowing it to unleash an offensive last year that detonated the pagers of rank-and-file members and decimated its senior ranks in secret bunkers. In Iran, Israel struck Hamas\u2019 top leader in an apartment in Tehran and knocked out many of its air defenses in an October strike that left parts of the capital exposed.",
      "But the Houthis' hideouts, weapons and infrastructure are less known to Israel, making its counterstrikes somewhat less effective. Hagari recognized that Israel\u2019s intelligence in Yemen was \u201can issue\u201d and said the military was working to improve.",
      "Until then, some in Israel are steeling themselves for a war of attrition with the distant enemy.",
      "\u201cThere's no quick fix,\u201d Citrinowicz said. \u201cEven if the war in Gaza ends, this is a threat that will not disappear.\u201d"

      "As president, Jimmy Carter brokered the peace agreement that removed Israel\u2019s most powerful enemy from the battlefield",
      "JERUSALEM -- As president, Jimmy Carter brokered the watershed peace agreement that removed Israel\u2019s most powerful enemy from the battlefield. But he incurred the Israeli government's wrath decades later when he said its military rule over the Palestinians amounted to apartheid.",
      "The Camp David peace accords, signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978, remain the biggest achievement from decades of mostly failed U.S. peacemaking in the Middle East.",
      "But for Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, they were clouded by what he saw as the continued oppression of the Palestinians and Israel\u2019s expansion of settlements on lands they want for a future state.",
      "Carter did not speak publicly after entering hospice care, months before the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza. But he devoted much of his life during and after his presidency trying to broker a just solution to the wider conflict.",
      "When Carter assumed office in 1977, Egypt and Israel had fought four devastating wars, the last of which began with an Egyptian surprise attack in 1973 that initially seemed to threaten Israel\u2019s existence.",
      "Carter\u2019s efforts led to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s landmark visit to Jerusalem and saw U.S. negotiators eventually wear down the famously hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.",
      "\u201cThere would not be a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt without President Carter,\u201d said Aharon Barak, a former Israeli attorney general and Supreme Court president who served as the Israeli legal adviser during the negotiations.",
      "Barak described Carter as a dogged negotiator, forcing the sides to work from 6 a.m. until after midnight and getting involved in the smallest details.",
      "\u201cHe was very tough, knew what he wanted, and he got what he wanted. And I admired it,\u201d he said.",
      "The first ever peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country saw Israel withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had captured in the 1967 Mideast war, and forge full diplomatic ties with Egypt, which had led the Arab struggle against Israel since its establishment in 1948.",
      "The two countries remain at peace nearly a half-century later.",
      "Although the Camp David agreements called for a transition to Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel also seized in 1967, it was never carried out. Carter was voted out of office two years later amid the Iran hostage crisis, and Mideast peace efforts languished.",
      "When Israelis and Palestinians finally came together to sign the Oslo Accords in 1993, the plan was similar to the one Carter had written 15 years earlier, with the creation of a Palestinian Authority and Israel\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories.",
      "But the peace process stalled out yet again in 2000, when the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement at Camp David. An armed Palestinian uprising erupted months later, and Israel launched a heavy military crackdown.",
      "Carter remained actively engaged in the Middle East as a global campaigner for human rights and democracy, with his Carter Center observing Palestinian elections. He spoke out against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, calling George W. Bush the worst president in the history of foreign affairs.",
      "In speeches, articles and a controversial book titled \u201cPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\u201d he called on the Palestinians to renounce violence and for U.S. intervention to end the conflict.",
      "But he reserved some of his strongest language for Israel\u2019s sprawling Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they were far more built-up than people knew and undermined hope for a negotiated solution to the century-old conflict.",
      "Most controversial was his contention that the situation in the West Bank \u2014 where some 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule alongside hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers who have full citizenship \u2014 amounts to apartheid.",
      "In a 2007 interview defending the book, Carter said the term was a \u201cvery accurate description\u201d of the \u201ctotal domination and oppression of Palestinians.\u201d",
      "Carter insisted the tough talk was coming from someone who had devoted his life to trying to bring about a lasting peace for Israel, but few Israelis saw it that way. Israel\u2019s supporters said the book was slanted against it and contained a number of inaccuracies.",
      "Israel bristles at any suggestion that its open-ended rule over the Palestinians amounts to apartheid, viewing it as an attack on its very legitimacy. It points to the fact that its own Arab minority has full citizenship, including the right to vote.",
      "Barak rejected the apartheid assertions, saying that as head of the Supreme Court he had presided over numerous rulings in favor of Palestinians against Israeli security bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s not apartheid,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was a complicated person,\u201d Barak said of Carter. \u201cBut on balance, I think he was a friend of Israel.\u201d",
      "The situation Carter described has only grown worse for the Palestinians. There have been no peace talks in well over a decade, Israel is rapidly expanding settlements, and its far-right government supports outright annexation of parts of the West Bank, making the establishment of a viable Palestinian state virtually impossible.",
      "Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem have meanwhile adopted Carter\u2019s language to describe the conflict, publishing lengthy reports in recent years arguing that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid.",
      "Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, said Carter\u2019s words were groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cToday, apartheid is the consensus within the global human rights movement and yet, despite the increasingly transparent reality on the ground, few leaders in the U.S. and Europe dare to utter the words President Carter did more than 16 years ago,\u201d Shakir said.",
      "In April 2008, an 83-year-old Carter toured the region with the Elders, a group of retired international leaders founded by Nelson Mandela. He once again courted controversy by meeting with the top leaders of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which had recently seized control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas does not accept Israel\u2019s existence and has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks over the years.",
      "But Carter said he had secured a personal commitment that Hamas would accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if the agreement were approved in a Palestinian referendum \u2014 a potentially big step toward accepting Israel.",
      "The Israeli government refused to meet with Carter, and both Israel and the U.S. criticized his decision to meet with Hamas.",
      "Israel and Hamas went on to fight five wars in Gaza, the deadliest of which was triggered by a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and is still ongoing.",
      "For Carter, now remembered the world over as a statesman and a humanitarian, the failure to resolve the conflict was a bitter disappointment.",
      "\u2018\u2019The most important single foreign policy goal in my life has been to bring peace to Israel, and peace and justice to Israel\u2019s neighbors,\u201d Carter told an Israeli newspaper during the 2008 visit.",

      "The majority of the migrants are from Venezuela, but they also include people from Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru and Ecuador. They've said they are tired of being blocked from crossing Mexico by the government.",
      "Though previous caravans have said they intend to reach the border \u2014 something that was almost never achieved \u2014 the migrants in the new caravan appear to be less clear about where they were headed. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to prevent migrants from entering the United States and stage mass deportations of those already in the country.",

      "Rosita Missoni, the matriarch of the iconic Italian fashion house that made zigzag-patterned knitwear high fashion, has died",
      "ROME -- Rosita Missoni, the matriarch of the iconic Italian fashion house that made colorful zigzag-patterned knitwear high fashion and helped launch Italian ready-to-wear, died Thursday, a company official said. She was 93.",
      "Missoni SpA confirmed the death and planned a statement along with the family later, said Alberto Gualeni, an international spokesperson for the company in Milan.",
      "Local officials offered condolences and recalled Missoni\u2019s ties to the small northern city of Gallarate where the Missoni brand was born in an artisan\u2019s shop in 1953.",
      "Born Rosita Jelmini, Missoni grew up in a family that owned a textile factory that produced shawls. When she met and married Ottavio Missoni, they founded their eponymous fashion house in Gallarate that would turn into a fashion dynasty, with the couple\u2019s three children and their offspring involved in expanding the brand.",
      "The Missonis got their first break in 1958, when the Rinascente department store commissioned 500 colorful vertically striped shirt dresses \u2014 the first to carry the Missoni label.",
      "The Missonis first showed their collection in Milan in 1966 and the brand helped turn the city into a fashion mecca.",
      "Their signature fashions, with the trademark graphic zigzags, long had a reputation for wearability and for surviving many seasons of changing trends. Family members were often the brand's best models, wearing Missoni graphic creations in everyday life.",
      "The founders turned over the business to their children in 1997, though Rosita remained involved in the Missoni home collection.",
      "In 2013, as the company celebrated its 60th anniversary, the family endured a double tragedy. The eldest Missoni son and the company\u2019s CEO, Vittorio Missoni, died when a plane carrying him and five others disappeared off Venezuela. It took six months to locate the plane wreckage in the seas off the South American country, during which time patriarch Ottavio Missoni died, aged 92.",
      "In 2018, the family sold a 41.2%-stake to the Italian investment fund FSI, but maintained majority control of the house.",
      "In 2021, the youngest daughter, Angela Missoni, stepped down as creative director after 24 years.",
      "There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.",

      "\u201cEveryone was taking shelter in their tents from the cold, and suddenly we found the world turning upside down. Why, and for what?\u201d said Ziyad Abu Jabal, displaced from Gaza City, after the strike in the seaside humanitarian zone known as Muwasi.",

      "Israel has repeatedly targeted the police in Gaza during 15 months of war, contributing to a breakdown of law and order in the territory that has made it difficult for humanitarian groups to deliver aid. Israel accuses the militant Hamas group of hijacking aid for its own purposes.",
      "The Hamas-run government had a police force numbering in the tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, while also violently suppressing dissent. Now officers have largely vanished from the streets in many areas.",
      "Meanwhile, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike that hit a group of people walking in the street in Maghazi in central Gaza. Their bodies were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.",
      "The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.",

      "Israel's military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers in England have unearthed nearly 200 dinosaur tracks that date back 166 million years",
      "LONDON -- A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.",
      "The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.",
      "\u201cThese footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.",
      "Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 60 feet (18 meters) in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 9-meter predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.",
      "An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.",
      "\u201cScientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.",
      "The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.",
      "\u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out,\" said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. \"Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d",
      "The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's \u201cDigging for Britain\u201d program next week.",

      "ROME -- Italy summoned Iran\u2019s ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran, as the government and opposition ramped up public pressure on the politically sensitive case.",
      "Cecilia Sala, a reporter for the Il Foglio daily newspaper, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, six days after she arrived on a journalist\u2019s visa. Tehran confirmed Monday that Sala had been arrested on charges of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.",
      "The Italian foreign ministry said it summoned Iran\u2019s ambassador Mohammad Reza Sabouri to demand her release and to ensure \u201cdignified detention conditions in full respect of human rights,\u201d including consular access and visitations.",
      "Italy's opposition Democratic Party also demanded her immediate release, citing Italian media reports about a phone call Sala\u2019s family received from her indicating she was sleeping on the floor and had not received a second package of personal items from the embassy.",
      "\u201cThe news of her conditions of detention are alarming,\u201d the Democrats said in a statement. \u201cThe inhuman treatment she is undergoing is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Sala\u2019s case has dominated Italian headlines for days and even featured in President Sergio Mattarella's end-of-year speech to the nation.",
      "Complicating matters are indications that Sala's fate has become intertwined with that of an Iranian man detained in Italy on Dec. 16. Mohammad Abedini-Najafabad was arrested at Milan\u2019s Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant alleging he was involved in the Jan. 28, 2024, drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops.",
      "U.S. federal prosecutors have charged Abedini and a co-defendant with export control violations after FBI specialists analyzed the drone navigation system used in the Jordan attack and traced it to them.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment on whether there was a link between the Sala case and its drone investigation.",
      "Abedini\u2019s Italian lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco, asked the Milan court this week to grant him house arrest, a decision that is pending, De Francesco said in an email. He declined to respond when asked to comment on the U.S. charges or possible links to the Sala case.",
      "Italian media have reported that Sala is essentially being used as a bargaining chip by Iran to secure Abedini\u2019s release. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani didn\u2019t dispute that scenario when he was asked about it during a call-in to the Rete4 broadcast Sunday.",
      "Ever since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis in Iran, in which dozens of U.S. hostages spent 444 days in captivity in Tehran, Iran has frequently used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n was sworn in Thursday as Puerto Rico\u2019s new governor as the island prepared for a normally ebullient ceremony overshadowed by widespread anger over a blackout that hit the U.S. territory days ago.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a Republican who backs President-elect Donald Trump and whose pro-statehood New Progressive Party secured a historic third consecutive term after she won the Nov. 5 election, has pledged to stabilize the Caribbean island\u2019s crumbling power grid.",
      "Before the start of a ceremony in front of Puerto Rico's seaside Capitol to celebrate her swearing in, Gonz\u00e1lez attended Mass surrounded by family and supporters.",
      "\u201cWhat better than to come first to thank God and to ask God to give me the wisdom, the fortitude and the tools to fulfill everything I promised the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez has promised to appoint an energy \u201cczar\u201d to review potential contractual breaches while another operator is found to possibly replace Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico.",
      "However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval from Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau and a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances.",
      "Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "While electricity had been restored to 98.9% of 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year\u2019s when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma.",
      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",
      "The anticipated revelry was characteristic of Gonz\u00e1lez, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party\u2019s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",

      "Krishna Das Prabhu, 39, faces sedition charges after he led huge rallies in the southeastern city of Chattogram. Hindu groups say there have been thousands of attacks against Hindus since early August, when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown.",
      "Prabhu didn't appear at the hearing, during which Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam rejected the bail plea, according to Public Prosecutor Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan. Security was tight, with police and soldiers guarding the court.",
      "\u201cHe faces serious charges like sedition and others involving the security and sovereignty of our country,\" Bhuiyan told The Associated Press by phone. \"We argued in the court that if he gets bail it could create anarchy as we saw in the past that he triggered violence on the court premises by calling thousands of his supporters to protest.",

      "Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee, a lawyer representing Prabhu, said that they would appeal the decision.",
      "The court rejected an earlier request for bail made while Prabhu didn't have lawyers. Lawyers who sought to represent him at that hearing said they were threatened or intimidated, and many of them are facing charges related to the death of a Muslim lawyer during clashes outside the court when Prabhu appeared there shortly after being arrested in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, in November.",

      "Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has issued a defiant statement to his rightwing supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a defiant statement to his conservative supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul, vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against what he called \u201canti-state forces,\u201d as law enforcement prepared to detain him over last month\u2019s martial law decree.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials has a week to execute its detainment warrant against Yoon, issued by a Seoul court on Tuesday. The warrant came after Yoon defied several requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office, hindering an investigation into whether his short-lived power grab on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion.",
      "Oh Dong-woon, the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, has indicated that police forces might be deployed if Yoon\u2019s security service resists the detention attempt, which could occur as early as Thursday. But it remains unclear whether Yoon can be compelled to submit to questioning.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team issued a statement on Thursday warning that any attempt by the anti-corruption agency to use police mobile units for his detention would exceed their legal authority. The lawyers further said that police officers could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens\u201d if they try to detain him.",
      "In a message to hundreds of supporters gathered outside his residence Wednesday evening, Yoon said he would continue to fight against anti-state forces \u201cviolating our sovereignty\u201d and putting the nation in \u201cdanger.\u201d He applauded his supporters for their efforts to protect the country\u2019s \u201cliberal democracy and constitutional order\u201d and said he was watching their protests on live YouTube broadcasts, according to a photo of the message shared by Yoon\u2019s lawyers.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative vote that impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the martial law imposition, accused the president of trying to mobilize his supporters to block his detention and called for law enforcement authorities to execute the warrant immediately.",
      "A growing number of Yoon\u2019s supporters were again gathering near his residence on Thursday morning amid a heavy police presence, waving small South Korean and American flags and holding signs opposing his impeachment.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have argued that the court\u2019s detainment warrant is \u201cinvalid,\u201d claiming that the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. They also accuse the court of bypassing a law that says locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "Some experts believe the anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities, would not risk clashing with Yoon\u2019s security service, which has said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law. The office may instead issue another summons for Yoon to appear for questioning if they are not able to execute the detainment warrant by Jan. 6.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended following the National Assembly vote to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoon\u2019s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",
      "To formally end Yoon\u2019s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoon\u2019s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court\u2019s review of Yoon\u2019s case.",
      "In the face of growing pressure, the country\u2019s new interim leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which possibly increased the chances of the court upholding Yoon\u2019s impeachment.",
      "Cho Han-chang, one of the newly appointed court justices, said Thursday that he begins his job with a \u201cheavy heart.\u201d Jeong Gye-seon, the other new justice, expressed hope that the remaining vacancy would be filled.",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.",
      "The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.",
      "The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating \u201cagainst the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.\u201d",
      "The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure \u201caccurately and fairly\u201d the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.",
      "\u201cVermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,\" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber\u2019s litigation center. \u201cThat is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 one state can\u2019t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont\u2019s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.",
      "Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of \u201ctrying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore states are following Vermont\u2019s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,\" Iarrapino added.",
      "Under the law, the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, is to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to Vermonters and the state from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The assessment would look at the effects on public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas. The state would use federal data to determine the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a fossil fuel company.",
      "It\u2019s a polluter-pays model affecting companies engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil attributable to more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the time period. The funds could be used by the state for such things as improving stormwater drainage systems; upgrading roads, bridges and railroads; relocating, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants; and making energy efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings. It\u2019s modeled after the federal Superfund pollution cleanup program.",
      "The approach taken by Vermont has drawn interest from other states, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a similar bill in December.",
      "The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects meant to repair or avoid future damage from climate change. The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would be subjected to the fines."

      "\u201cThe parties agree that industry conditions were deteriorating, and that MASN would continue to experience subscriber declines in the 2022-2026 period (though they disagree as to the rate of such losses ...),\u201d the panel wrote in a decision that redacted many of the the figures each team argued for.",
      "This marked the third straight five-year period the teams took their dispute to the RSDC. The decision became public when the Nationals filed a petition asking for the New York Supreme Court to confirm the award. The filing of the petition was first reported by The Sun in Baltimore.",
      "Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer representing the Orioles, and Patrick Curran, a lawyer representing the Nationals, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Litigation over 2012-16 rights fees resulted in a 2019 RSDC decision by Attanasio, Seattle Mariners president Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro valuing them at $296.8 million. After arguments that went to the New York Court of Appeals, the sides agreed to a settlement in June 2023.",
      "A RSDC decision on Nov. 8, 2023, by Attanasio, Montfort and Werner said Washington was owed about $304.1 million by MASN for 2017-21, after an adjustment downward of almost $45.5 million for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. That decision was confirmed by New York Supreme Court Justice Andrew Borrok the following month.",
      "MASN was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore\u2019s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972.",
      "The Orioles were given a supermajority partnership interest in MASN, starting at 90%, and Washington made a $75 million payment to the network for an initial 10% stake.",
      "The agreement between the clubs set network\u2019s rights payments to each team at $20 million apiece in 2005 and 2006, rising to $25 million in 2007, with $1 million annual increases through 2011. The deal called for the Nationals\u2019 equity to increase 1% annually, starting after the 2009 season, with a cap of 33%.",

      "The agency said it\u2019s the first time it has fined an airline for chronic delays on specific routes, which it blamed on \u201cunrealistic scheduling\u201d by JetBlue.",
      "\u201cIllegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today\u2019s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has already taken several actions to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene",
      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe needs facing this region are vast and require immediate attention,\u201d Stein said at a news conference. \u201cI pledge to do everything in my power as governor to accelerate recovery of the rebuilding of a more resilient region for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",
      "More than 12,000 western North Carolinians are displaced from their homes due to Helene, which also caused significant damage to more than 8,000 private roads and bridges, Stein's orders said.",
      "\u201cWhen I have met with affected folks here in the mountains, the need for housing assistance and the repairing of private bridges and roads has come up in nearly every conversation,\" he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina \u2014 I want you to know that I hear you.\u201d",
      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

The winning airlines therefore deserved credit for getting most passengers to their destinations on time, Bowen said.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a Republican who backs President-elect Donald Trump and whose pro-statehood New Progressive Party secured a historic third consecutive term after she won the Nov. 5 election, has pledged to stabilize the Caribbean island\u2019s crumbling power grid.",
      "\u201cThere are many challenges facing our island,\u201d she said in her first public address as governor as she acknowledged the blackout in a speech to a crowd gathered in front of the seaside Capitol. \u201cThat is precisely what moves me to address that first challenge with a sense of urgency.\u201d",
      "She pledged to improve Puerto Rico's infrastructure, hospitals and schools, adding that she intends to boost bilingual education.",

      "Protesting the ceremony was Yara Humar\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, an aquatic physical therapist whose 83-year-old mother remains without power.",

      "Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "While electricity had been restored to 99% of the utility's 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year\u2019s Day when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma.",
      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",
      "The anticipated revelry was characteristic of Gonz\u00e1lez, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party\u2019s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Supporters and critics gathered for the ceremony, some clutching umbrellas to shield themselves from the blistering sun.",
      "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s going to be a great governor,\u201d said Amanda S\u00e1nchez Le\u00f3n, a retired government employee, who arrived two hours early to secure a spot outside an area reserved for guests. She said she was hopeful that Gonz\u00e1lez would reduce violent crimes and improve education and health, \u201cespecially for us older people.\u201d She also believed the power crisis would improve and that Gonz\u00e1lez would see her promises through.",
      "\u201cThe people are suffering,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",

      "But Rodr\u00edguez remains rankled at what she believes is the misspending of government money.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what bothers the people. You\u2019re doing fine, sure, but look at us,\u201d she said.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",
      "\u201cStatehood means equality, and I want us to have that access to opportunities,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI want to have those opportunities here so that our people can move forward.\u201d"

      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

      "Some investors and analysts are counting on the AI rush to continue, even though critics say it\u2019s sent prices for some stocks too high too quickly. As the calendar flips to a new year, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says it\u2019s the \u201dsame tech playbook in year 3 of this tech AI driven bull market,\u201d for example.",
      "Such optimism, of course, can also make contrarians feel nervous.",
      "A measure of how heavily Wall Street analysts are recommending stocks is at its highest level since early 2022, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian. She says the measure has been a reliable contrarian indicator in the past, and it\u2019s just a bit shy of triggering a signal to sell for those who are leery when much of Wall Street rushes in the same direction.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of 2024 and almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country\u2019s pipeline network \u2014 set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union \u2014 to Europe, under a five-year agreement.",
      "Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit \u201cin the interest of national security.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses,\" Halushchenko said Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app. \"Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today.\u201d",
      "At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn \u201cadditional billions ... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens.\u201d However, he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.",
      "Gazprom said in a statement Wednesday it \u201chas no technical and legal possibility\u201d of sending gas through Ukraine, due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.",
      "Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.",
      "After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky.",
      "The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the United States filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.",
      "Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d",
      "Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023, according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.",
      "Gazprom halted supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine\u2019s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in.

      "Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova, which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.",
      "Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire, Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed.",
      "Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova\u2019s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said.",
      "In an online statement, the company urged residents to gather household members together in a single room, hang blankets over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters. It said some key facilities, including hospitals, were exempt from the cuts.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as fears mounted that the gas shortages could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, for decades dependent on Russian energy supplies.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force people in the separatist territory to travel to Moldova proper, seeking basic amenities to get through the harsh winter and placing further strain on resources.",
      "Moldova, Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.",
      "On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a win for those opposed to the Kremlin's policies.

      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

      "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- On a frigid morning in Moldova\u2019s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with \u201cno heating, no light.\u201d",
      "His concerns aren\u2019t unfounded.",
      "On Jan. 1, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cI feel that we\u2019ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve \u2026 which worries me greatly,\u201d Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. \u201cPrice increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that\u2019s something entirely different.\u201d",
      "The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper.",
      "\u201cThere will be no heating, no light,\u201d Murzin added. \u201cWe are entering a very difficult year.\"",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a \u201cpotential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova\u2019s already-strained resources\u201d to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol.",
      "\u201cIt could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue\u201d ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said.",
      "The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,\u201d said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.\u201d",
      "After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy \"as a political weapon\u201d and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,\u201d he said.",
      "For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid, but we\u2019re happy that there\u2019s no snow and the temperatures aren\u2019t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I work from home and I\u2019ll be directly affected.\u201d",
      "She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, \u201cBut regarding power and gas, it\u2019s the first time we face this,\u201d she said.",
      "Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom\u2019s decision and said that the country has gas supplies \u201cfor the heating season\u201d and measures will be taken \u201cto ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,\u201d adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.\u201d",
      "Olga Rosca, an adviser to Sandu, told the AP that most of Moldova, excluding Transnistria, \u201cshouldn\u2019t see major disruptions\u201d and that \u201ccheaper electricity previously supplied from Transnistria will be replaced by more expensive imports from the EU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Transnistrian region, however, the situation will be much more serious,\u201d she said, \u201cand any crisis there will inevitably affect all of Moldova.\"",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast \u201chybrid war\u201d by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations.",
      "The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation to potentially recover \u201cstrategic assets that were forcefully taken over,\u201d referring to Moldovagaz, Moldova\u2019s main gas operator in which Gazprom owns a majority stake.",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz.",

      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",
      "It warned of store closures, saying the situation is \u201cclearly untenable.\u201d",
      "In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa\u2019s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had \u2018impaired\u201d its investment in Zimbabwe \u201cto a book value of zero\u201d because of the \u201cdeteriorating economic conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it\u2019s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,\u201d said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers\u2019 situation.",
      "\u201cEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don\u2019t care. They are there for survival,\u201d Mugano said.",
      "The contrast is palpable in Harare\u2019s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.",
      "Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.",
      "\u201cBusiness is booming,\u201d said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.",
      "Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.",
      "More than 80% of Zimbabwe\u2019s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.",
      "For Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite confusing, especially for people like me who really don\u2019t understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets,\u201d he said.",
      "He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.",
      "\u201cI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I will do this more often.\u201d"

      "Desiree Hill, owner of Crown\u2019s Corner Mechanic in Conyers, Georgia, started her business solo as a mobile mechanic. Sharing videos of her work on TikTok helped spread the word and she became so popular she was able to open a 9,000 square foot brick and mortar shop with five employees 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cEvery day I get at least two to three customers that have seen me on TikTok, watched my videos and wanted to become a customer,\u201d she said.",

      "According to TikTok's own estimates, small businesses on TikTok would lose more than $1 billion in revenue in a single month if the ban goes into effect.",
      "The Justice Department ordered the app's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban by Jan. 19, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court will take up the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has asked the Supreme Court for a delay.",
      "If a ban does occur, small businesses will have to migrate to other platforms to find their customers. Instagram Reels, SnapChat and YouTube Shorts are alternatives. The good news is brands likely already have a presence there. But it may be harder to reach teens that have made TikTok their preferred social media app.",
      "Another alternative is to build a strong database of customers that opt in to providing contact emails or phone numbers. That lets owners reach out directly to customers with promotions and other marketing messages.",
      "But Crown Corner Mechanic's Hill said she is worried that other sites may not have the reach that TikTok does. She has a presence on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, but it's not the same, she said.",
      "\u201cI am worried because there is no preparation for this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt holds such a significant place in regards to my customer base and how I reach customers that if I lose TikTok, I will lose a large part of my business or I will lose my ability to grow anymore.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street expects corporate profits to have surged in 2024 and forecasts an even stronger jump for 2025.",
      "Companies still face a long list of uncertainties in the year ahead, including economic policy shifts, reheated inflation and shifts in the jobs market and consumer spending.",
      "Earnings for companies within the S&P 500 are expected to have grown by about 9.4% in 2024, according to FactSet. Companies will start reporting their final quarterly financial results for that year in the next few weeks. It will mark a sharp gain from 1.4% growth in 2023.",
      "Profit growth for companies followed the rising economic tide. The labor market remained strong, helping support consumer spending for goods and services. Prices remain high on many items and services, but the rate of inflation has eased significantly, helping companies lower costs in some cases and relieving some pressure on consumers.",
      "Wall Street's 2025 forecast for over 12% profit growth relies largely on those conditions continuing to prevail. Earnings will be closely-watched as a key measure to justify the broader markets gains.",
      "\u201cWith the market looking expensive versus history, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if earnings growth were a greater driver of market performance than in recent years, making companies\u2019 ability to deliver on profitability estimates all the more critical in 2025,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management, in a research note.",
      "The Federal Reserve's path ahead for interest rates also remains a factor for companies and consumers looking for less pressure on borrowing costs. The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate three times in 2024.",
      "Expectations for further cuts have been tempered by worries over stubborn inflation. The rate of inflation had eased but remains stuck just above the Fed's target rate of 2%. Recent months have shown signs that it even edged higher.",
      "The Fed has signaled more caution because of inflation worries. Tariff threats from incoming President Donald Trump have fueled those worries on Wall Street. Trump has threatened blanket tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S., which in itself would raise prices for imported goods and raw materials for companies, which typically pass those costs along to consumers. Other nations would likely respond with retaliatory tariffs, which would almost certainly add to pressure on prices for businesses and consumers.",

      "Just over two years after the debut of ChatGPT, the world is getting a little savvier about what artificial intelligence technology can do for us and what it\u2019s not so great at",
      "If 2023 was a year of wonder about artificial intelligence, 2024 was the year to try to get that wonder to do something useful without breaking the bank.",
      "There was a \u201cshift from putting out models to actually building products,\u201d said Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton University computer science professor and co-author of the new book \u201cAI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can\u2019t, and How to Tell The Difference.\u201d",
      "The first 100 million or so people who experimented with ChatGPT upon its release two years ago actively sought out the chatbot, finding it amazingly helpful at some tasks or laughably mediocre at others.",
      "Now such generative AI technology is baked into an increasing number of technology services whether we're looking for it or not \u2014 for instance, through the AI-generated answers in Google search results or new AI techniques in photo editing tools.",
      "\u201cThe main thing that was wrong with generative AI last year is that companies were releasing these really powerful models without a concrete way for people to make use of them,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year is gradually building out these products that can take advantage of those capabilities and do useful things for people.\"",
      "At the same time, since OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023 and competitors introduced similarly performing AI large language models, these models have stopped getting significantly \u201cbigger and qualitatively better,\" resetting overblown expectations that AI was racing every few months to some kind of better-than-human intelligence, Narayanan said. That's also meant that the public discourse has shifted from \u201cis AI going to kill us?\u201d to treating it like a normal technology, he said.",
      "On quarterly earnings calls this year, tech executives often heard questions from Wall Street analysts looking for assurances of future payoffs from huge spending on AI research and development. Building AI systems behind generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini requires investing in energy-hungry computing systems running on powerful and expensive AI chips. They require so much electricity that tech giants announced deals this year to tap into nuclear power to help run them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of capital that has been poured into this technology,\u201d said Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan.",
      "Another analyst at the New York investment bank drew attention over the summer by arguing AI isn't solving the complex problems that would justify its costs. He also questioned whether AI models, even as they're being trained on much of the written and visual data produced over the course of human history, will ever be able to do what humans do so well. Rangan has a more optimistic view.",
      "\u201cWe had this fascination that this technology is just going to be absolutely revolutionary, which it has not been in the two years since the introduction of ChatGPT,\u201d Rangan said. \"It\u2019s more expensive than we thought and it\u2019s not as productive as we thought.\"",
      "Rangan, however, is still bullish about its potential and says that AI tools are already proving \u201cabsolutely incrementally more productive\u201d in sales, design and a number of other professions.",
      "Some workers wonder whether AI tools will be used to supplement their work or to replace them as the technology continues to grow. The tech company Borderless AI has been using an AI chatbot from Cohere to write up employment contracts for workers in Turkey or India without the help of outside lawyers or translators.",
      "Video game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists who went on strike in July said they feared AI could reduce or eliminate job opportunities because it could be used to replicate one performance into a number of other movements without their consent. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year\u2019s film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months. Game companies have also signed side agreements with the union that codify certain AI protections in order to keep working with actors during the strike.",
      "Musicians and authors have voiced similar concerns over AI scraping their voices and books. But generative AI still can't create unique work or \u201ccompletely new things,\u201d said Walid Saad, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and AI expert at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cWe can train it with more data so it has more information. But having more information doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cAs humans, we understand the world around us, right? We understand the physics. You understand if you throw a ball on the ground, it\u2019s going to bounce. AI tools currently don\u2019t understand the world.\u201d",
      "AI can mimic what it learns from patterns, he said, but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand the world so that they reason on what happens in the future.\u201d That, he said, is where AI falls short.",
      "\u201cIt still cannot imagine things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that imagination is what we hope to achieve later.\u201d",
      "Saad pointed to a meme about AI as an example of that shortcoming. When someone prompted an AI engine to create an image of salmon swimming in a river, he said, the AI created a photo of a river with cut pieces of salmon found in grocery stores.",
      "\u201cWhat AI lacks today is the common sense that humans have, and I think that is the next step,\u201d he said.",
      "That type of reasoning is a key part of the process of making AI tools more useful to consumers, said Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's innovation and incubation arm, Outshift. AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI \u201cagents\u201d that can do more useful things on people\u2019s behalf.",
      "That could mean being able to ask an AI agent an ambiguous question and have the model able to reason and plan out steps to solving an ambitious problem, Pandey said. A lot of technology, he said, is going to move in that direction in 2025.",
      "Pandey predicts that eventually, AI agents will be able to come together and perform a job the way multiple people come together and solve a problem as a team rather than simply accomplishing tasks as individual AI tools. The AI agents of the future will work as an ensemble, he said.",
      "Future Bitcoin software, for example, will likely rely on the use of AI software agents, Pandey said. Those agents will each have a specialty, he said, with \u201cagents that check for correctness, agents that check for security, agents that check for scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to an agentic future,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these agents being very good at certain skills, but also have a little bit of a character or color to them, because that\u2019s how we operate.\u201d",
      "AI tools have also streamlined, or lent in some cases a literal helping hand, to the medical field. This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry \u2014 one of two Nobels awarded to AI-related science \u2014 went to work led by Google that could help discover new medicines.",
      "Saad, the Virginia Tech professor, said that AI has helped bring faster diagnostics by quickly giving doctors a starting point to launch from when determining a patient's care. AI can't detect disease, he said, but it can quickly digest data and point out potential problem areas for a real doctor to investigate. As with other arenas, however, it poses a risk of perpetuating falsehoods.",
      "Tech giant OpenAI has touted its AI-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy,\u201d for example. But experts have said that Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences.",
      "Pandey, of Cisco, said that some of the company's customers who work in pharmaceuticals have noted that AI has helped bridge the divide between \u201cwet labs,\u201d in which humans conduct physical experiments and research, and \u201cdry labs\u201d where people analyze data and often use computers for modeling.",
      "When it comes to pharmaceutical development, that collaborative process can take several years, he said \u2014 with AI, the process can be cut to a few days.",
      "\"That, to me, has been the most dramatic use,\" Pandey said."

      "Rafael Campos might be the happiest player at Kapalua for The Sentry",
      "KAPALUA, Hawaii -- The cream-colored enveloped arrived at the Puerto Rico home of Rafael Campos on Dec. 23, and there was no mistaking who it was from \u2014 Augusta National \u2014 or what it contained. That's why he waited a few days to open it and find his invitation to the Masters.",
      "\u201cI wanted that to be my Christmas present,\u201d Campos said. \u201cAnd it was surreal. Just trying to understand, \u2018This is really happening, right?\u2019 And it was so cool.\u201d",
      "Six weeks after the 36-year-old Campos delivered one of those feel-good moments in golf by winning the Bermuda Championship, he still has a hard time fathoming what happened.",
      "He feared he would have to miss the Bermuda Championship because his wife was due with their first child. He brought their daughter home and arrived in Bermuda some two hours before his tee time. And then he won.",
      "No wonder he can't stop smiling.",
      "\u201cAt least one night of the week for the last month-and-a-half, my wife have made a statement like, \u2018It really happened,\u2019\u201d Campos said.",
      "But for how much longer?",
      "The PGA Tour has a long history of such moments, and they might happen a lot less often under the new structure for 2026. Only the top 100 players \u2014 down from 125 \u2014 keep full cards. Field sizes are shrinking. Monday qualifying spots are being reduced. This is more cut throat.",
      "Campos remembers when he first heard rumblings of this new system.",
      "\u201cIn the back of my mind I was like, \u2018Man, it\u2019s going to be even harder for us now,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of it. I understand why they\u2019re doing it, like cutting time so everyone can finish, and supposedly it\u2019s for the sponsors. Then again, you\u2019re taking away jobs from us. And it\u2019s not easy. There\u2019s so many thousands and thousands of unbelievable golfers that deserve to be there.\u201d",
      "The out-of-nowhere victory \u2014 the first by a Puerto Rican since the beloved Chi Chi Rodriguez, who had died three months earlier \u2014 is what brought Campos to Maui for the start of a PGA Tour season that he figured would not include him.",
      "It gave him job security for two years, something he has never had, and a chance to plan a schedule instead of hoping tournaments had room for him. And yes, he's going to the Masters.",
      "None of this seemed remotely possible for so much of the year.",
      "Campos learned his wife, Stephanie, was pregnant in the spring and all he could think about was making sure he could provide for them. And then he started missing cuts, three in a row, then nine in a row. He was running out of time, and so was his wife.",
      "Her due date was the Sunday of the Bermuda Championship, the penultimate tournament of the season. Campos was No. 147 in the FedEx Cup, and even if he stayed in the top 150, chances to play were going to be severely limited in 2025.",
      "He couldn't afford to miss Bermuda.",
      "\u201cI've always had a backup plan,\u201d said Campos, who turned pro after playing at Virginia Commonwealth and who had managed only one previous season in the big leagues. \u201cThis was the first time \u2014 honestly, things were going extremely bad \u2014 I did not have a fallback plan. It was tough on my mind knowing that, \u2018Man, I worked so hard for 15 years, I could lose everything and start back at square one.\u2019\u201d",
      "His wife suggested they induce labor. Campos was not willing to leave Puerto Rico until he could bring his wife and child home. Their daughter, Paola, was born Monday evening and he was able to bring them home Wednesday, less than 24 hours before his tee time.",
      "\u201cI remember telling my wife, \u2018Can I have 20 minutes with the baby, just by myself in the room?\u2019 It was so cool just holding her,\u201d he said.",
      "Gone was the stress of trying to make cuts the last six months, replaced by peace and joy. And then he flew to Boston, arriving after midnight and sleeping in the airport until his connection to Bermuda in the morning. He arrived at Port Royal just under two hours from his tee time.",
      "That's normally enough time to prepare to tee off, except Campos kept talking about the birth of his little girl. What followed the next four days is a blur.",
      "He made the cut and then shot 62 in the third round to tie for the lead. And on Sunday, he held his nerve and pulled away with a 68 to win by three. A Golf Channel reporter approached him on the 18th green and Campos was sobbing.",
      "\u201cI just can't believe this is happening to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The $1,242,000 was more than he had won in his previous 53 starts on the PGA Tour. But this wasn't about just money. This was about being a tour winner, a lifelong dream. He didn't even realize he would be going to Kapalua, much less the Masters.",
      "He thought back to when he was 9 and his father was invited to play golf for the first time, thinking it would take an hour or two. He dropped his kids off at the driving range. Six hours later, Campos was still hitting the little white golf ball. He was hooked.",
      "And then in his 14th year as a pro, the week he became a father and feared losing his job, he won the Bermuda Championship.",
      "How did that happen?",
      "\u201cIt's funny how everybody says, \u2018All it takes is one week.\u2019 And you always believe it and all that, but you don't realize it. It's true in this sport. One week can really change your life and your family's life.\u201d",

      "But first, two powerhouse college football programs meet Jan. 10 at the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium.",
      "No. 6 Ohio State (12-2, CFP No. 8 seed) was favored by nearly a touchdown in many early Cotton Bowl betting lines, reflecting the confidence generated by the Buckeyes' optimization of their bountiful talent over their last two games. Ohio State has looked like the best team in the nation since the first 12-team CFP began last month.",
      "Coach Ryan Day's team has rebounded from two regular-season losses to rout a pair of elite opponents by a combined 45 points. Ohio State beat No. 7 Tennessee 42-17 in Columbus before jumping to an early 34-point lead in a 41-21 thrashing of top-ranked Oregon in the 111th Rose Bowl on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s kind of an intangible thing that you can\u2019t describe (in) the chemistry that we have on this team,\u201d Ohio State receiver Emeka Egbuka said. \u201cAnd we just really don\u2019t want it to end. These are some of my best friends in the world. Obviously, no matter what we do, no matter if we keep winning, it\u2019s going to come to an end soon. So we\u2019re just taking in all the moments and just trying to push for one more game to spend with each other.\u201d",
      "Beating the previously unbeaten Ducks in handy fashion underscored the immensity of the Buckeyes' talent \u2014 and it made a strong argument in favor of the 12-team playoff, since a team with Ohio State's two losses easily could have been left out of previous playoff formats with smaller fields.",

      "Ewers was a top prospect in the 2022 recruiting class who committed to Texas in August 2020, but flipped to Ohio State three months later as one of the highest-rated prospects ever to sign with the school. He graduated from high school a year early and took two snaps for the Buckeyes as a third-string freshman backup to C.J. Stroud in 2021.",

      "This Cotton Bowl is just the fourth-ever meeting between these two titans of the sport \u2014 and coincidentally, it\u2019s even a preview of next year\u2019s season opener when Texas visits Ohio Stadium on Aug. 30.",

      "Imagine having 5 gallons of mayonnaise dumped over your head",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Imagine having 5 gallons of mayonnaise dumped over your head.",
      "Well, that\u2019s exactly what the winning head coach of the annual Duke\u2019s Mayo Bowl receives as a \u201creward\u201d for winning the game at Bank of America Stadium, a tradition born in 2021 as Duke\u2019s Mayo looked to carve out its unique niche in the college football bowl world.",
      "Each year, the mayo dump trends on social media \u2014 and college football fans just can\u2019t seem to look away, no matter how disgusting the idea is to some observers.",
      "\u201cI think with my bald head the mayo should just slide right off,\" joked Minnesota head coach P.J. Fleck, whose team will play Virginia Tech on Friday night in the bowl game. \"I might have to do a little pre-dumping of the mayo just to make sure it does slide off. I have my own strategy just in case, but I can't let me secret out.\"",
      "There's plenty of preparation that goes into the annual mayo dump.",
      "Staff members begin by pouring five 1-gallon containers of mayonnaise into a large Gatorade-sized cooler around the start of the fourth quarter. Then, they take turns briskly stirring the mayo for more than 25 minutes with a large wooden stick.",
      "\u201cThat changes the consistency just a little bit so it's more pourable,\u201d said Duke\u2019s Mayo brand director Rebecca Lupesco. \u201dSome people think we add water. There's no water added, it's just straight mayonnaise. We just stir it up. It can be a workout.\"",
      "As tradition has it, the winning coach is seated on a chair on the field after the game and two workers will raise the cooler and pour the mayo over his head.",
      "It's a process that needed to be refined over time.",
      "In 2021, one of the handles on the cooler shifted, causing South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer to get bopped over the head with the bucket after being doused in mayo. That issue has since been addressed and the handles have been fortified to make them immovable.",
      "\u201cSince that incident we now pick our mayo dumpers very carefully,\u201d Lupesco said with a smile. \u201cLast year we did a mayo combine where 10 people were selected to come in and compete. They had to do deadlifts with buckets of mayonnaise and catch footballs with mayo on their hands. We had to make sure these people were strong enough.\"",
      "This year's mayo dumpers remain a surprise.",
      "But they will be adequately trained first, Lupesco said. She said the two pourers will practice by dumping multiple buckets of mayo over a \u201cdummy coach\" earlier in the day, with an emphasis on making sure they lift the cooler high enough above the coach's head so no one gets hit in the head.",
      "Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said he's not a big fan of mayonnaise, but would gladly accept the bath if it means a Hokies win.",
      "\u201cIt will be like, \u2018c\u2019mon and give it to me! I want that sucker!,'\u201d Pry said. \u201cThe players and my family have had a lot of fun watching other coaches get dumped on. So I hope we are that fortunate.\u201d",
      "Former West Virginia coach Neal Brown was last year's recipient of the mayo dump after his Mountaineers' 30-10 blowout win over North Carolina \u2014 a moment he'll almost certainly never forget.",
      "\u201cI feel cold, I feel wet. ... but I feel like a winner,\u201d Brown said while covered in mayonnaise.",

      "Valerio Ferme, who took over as university president to start the year, announced Moccia's dismissal Thursday and that Amber Burdge, NMSU\u2019s deputy athletic director for strategic initiatives and leadership, would be acting athletic director.",
      "\u201cAfter carefully reviewing the recent report issued by the New Mexico Department of Justice, I felt we needed a fresh start in our athletics program,\u201d Ferme said. \u201cI have utter confidence in Dr. Burdge\u2019s ability to lead our Athletic Department, and look forward to working with her in the coming months.\u201d",
      "Ferme said Burdge played a key role in NMSU\u2019s strategic response to hazing prevention as the school's senior female administrator and deputy Title IX coordinator.",
      "Two former basketball players have agreed to plea deals in the assault cases brought against them while a third is due for trial next month.",
      "The assault allegations forced New Mexico State to shut down its 2022-23 season. In 2023, the school paid out $8 million to settle a lawsuit brought by two of the victims, former players Deuce Benjamin and Shak Odunewu, who went public with the stories of their abuse.",
      "But also in 2023, New Mexico State gave Moccia a five-year contract extension and a $72,000 raise to $351,000 a year in the first year of the new deal, which was scheduled to end in 2028.",
      "That deal was signed by chancellor Dan Arvizu on the same day he stepped down from his post \u2014 timing the school said was a coincidence.",
      "The state Department of Justice review of the sexual assaults found that they \u201cdid not occur in a vacuum but were reflective of a more pervasive toxic culture throughout the program.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere were ample opportunities for those around the team to observe this toxic culture as it was developing, but they failed to effectively intervene and prevent it,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis inaction was compounded by inadequate institutional preventative safeguards.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs an initial matter, it is worth noting that this belief conflicts with actual practice; Director Moccia met with and observed pertinent videos by (two of the accused players) after the OIE had received Deuce Benjamin\u2019s report in February 2022,\u201d the report said.",
      "The report also noted the school's lack of transparency in using booster funds instead of state funds to pay Moccia under his new contract.",

      "Too bad that so far, hardly any of the games on the road to that national championship have been worth a hoot.",
      "And interesting to see that all the games that supposedly mean nothing is where most of the fun and mayhem has played out.",
      "The day after New Year's Day used to be when college football folded up the tent, but now it's simply time for a break. Including Thursday's Sugar Bowl \u2014 the quarterfinal showdown between Georgia and Notre Dame that was pushed back a day due to the deadly attack in New Orleans \u2014 Jan. 2 opened with four meaningful games left on the schedule and 18 days left to go before a champion is crowned.",
      "The most notable stuff over bowl season, meanwhile, has come out of the nearly three dozen bowl games that aren't supposed to mean that much, but in many ways, still do.",
      "A look at who won, who lost and what we'd all be missing if we boiled down college football to only its 12-team playoff.",
      "Colorado and Alabama were among the teams that focused on the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d of football and leaned into the idea that even their NFL-bound stars were showing solidarity by playing in these bowl games.",
      "At CU, that meant amping up the insurance policies for Heisman winner Travis Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders.",
      "\u201cTo talk about where the game is, where it\u2019s going and how leadership is taking care of the players, I thought that\u2019s excellent,\u201d Colorado linebackers coach Andre\u2019 Hart said.",
      "On a similar note, quarterback Jalen Milroe singed up for Alabama's game against Michigan, but the Tide fell flat 19-13. Turns out, more than a dozen of Milroe's teammates opted not to join him, and not even a first-round quarterback can overcome that.",
      "Nothing these days says \u201cbig\u201d in sports better than Snoop Dogg himself. This year, the rapper-commentator-celebrity put his name on the Arizona Bowl, and also offered all the Colorado State and Miami (Ohio) players in that game a chance to make some NIL money.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media.",

The Miami quarterback threw for three touchdowns in the first half, but sat out the second in a 42-41 loss to Iowa State in the tastiest game on the schedule \u2014 the Pop Tarts Bowl.",
      "Asked what led to that decision, Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal said he was keeping that information private. But not much needed to be said. Either Ward and Sanders could end up as the top pick in this year's draft.",
      "This bowl season gave us the Miami-Iowa State thriller and four games decided in multiple overtimes.",
      "Toledo and Pittsburgh went six OTs before the Rockets prevailed 48-46. That game broke a college bowl record of five OTs that was all of one-day old \u2014 set when South Florida beat San Jose State 41-39.",
      "The Sun Bowl and Armed Forces Bowl were both decided by defenses (Navy and Louisville) denying 2-point conversions in the waning seconds.",
      "Kansas State overcame a 17-point deficit to beat Rutgers 44-41 in a game featuring 943 yards in offense.",
      "One of the multi-OT games was the Texas 39-31 win over Arizona State in the playoff quarterfinals, aka the Peach Bowl.",
      "Never mind that Texas tried to give this game away multiple times \u2014 two missed field goals in the fourth quarter were part of that \u2014 this was the single game thus far in the playoff that has been remotely compelling and the only one decided by single digits.",
      "The ugly side of sports spilled out in one game between East Carolina and N.C. State that featured a bench-clearing brawl triggered when an ECU player snatched a towel from the beltline of his opponent.",
      "It ended with official Rod Tucker battered and bloodied \u2014 left with a nasty cut under his eye after trying to break up the fracas.",
      "There was also the little matter of South Carolina coach Shane Beamer having to be restrained from going after his Illinois counterpart, Bret Bielema, after Bielema made a gesture toward the Carolina bench when he went out to check on an injured player.",
      "Bielema explained he was upset with the Gamecocks use of a signal that typically means a team isn't going to attempt to return a kick and, so, indicates to the coverage team that it can slow down. Beamer wasn't much into hearing explanations after his team's 21-17 loss in the Military Bowl.",
      "\u201cIn all my years of coaching I\u2019ve never seen that happen,\u201d Beamer said. \u201cAn opposing coach come over while his player\u2019s hurt and basically have something to say to the opposing head coach.\u201d",
      "Coaches in bowl games and the College Football Playoff both found themselves fighting the churn of the transfer portal, which was open from Dec. 9-28 and, thus, produced tumult in rosters across the board.",

      "Liverpool, top of the Premier League and the Champions League, has its sights on equalling United 's record 20 Premier League titles and more. Liverpool has lost to United just once in seven years in the Premier League, and most recently won 3-0 at Old Trafford in September.",
      "United is closer to the relegation zone than the top in another calamitous campaign which has seen the departure of a manager, a sporting director and the exile of one of its leading players.",
      "The gap between Liverpool and United is widening to the point where one is in contention for a quadruple of trophies and the other is talking about top flight survival.",
      "How have English soccer\u2019s two most successful teams ended up on such differing paths?",
      "United has been in alarming decline since winning a record 20th title in Alex Ferguson's final season as manager in 2013. It hasn't come close to winning another since his retirement. Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent manager hired in the last 11-plus years.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag all failed to deliver consistent success and the upheaval from so much managerial change has repeatedly set back United as the club has lurched from one direction to another.",

      "Perhaps he has been fortunate to take over when City has gone into freefall but Liverpool's 14 wins from 18 games in the league would be title-challenging form in any season.",
      "Billions have been spent at United yet there have been more costly errors than transfer successes.",
      "Superstar signings such as Angel di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba, Casemiro and Jadon Sancho have proved to be big disappointments. From the last transfer window, signees such as Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt have struggled.",
      "Amorim is likely to have to sell in January if he wants to bring more players in and Marcus Rashford, recently dropped from the team, could be his best chance of raising funds.",
      "Conversely, Liverpool has been one of the savviest operators in the transfer market over the past decade. When it has spent big, it has generally spent well, with the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson proving pillars of its trophy haul. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were relative bargains.",
      "Under Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American conglomerate that also owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool became a major force in England and Europe again and ended a 30-year title drought in the Premier League.",
      "The hiring of Klopp was pivotal to that but so was Michael Edwards, the sporting director who was integral to so many transfer successes. He left in 2022 but is back as FSG chief executive of football and helped to guide the transition to Slot.",
      "United's American owner, the Glazer family, has faced regular fan protests since its leveraged buyout of the club in 2005.",
      "The minority investment by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe last year sparked optimism. He assumed control of the club's soccer operations but that hasn't gone to plan so far.",
      "Ten Hag was fired months after signing a contract extension and sporting director Dan Ashworth departed after less than six months. The signings in Ratcliffe's first summer transfer window also look questionable with United 14th in the standings and just seven points above the relegation zone.",
      "Liverpool is enjoying an outstanding campaign with big issues to be resolved.",
      "Salah, Van Dijk and Trent Alexander Arnold are out of contract after this season. Salah and Van Dijk are in their 30s and in dispute is the length of contract Liverpool is prepared to offer them. Alexander Arnold, meanwhile, is reportedly a target for Real Madrid.",
      "Amorim's immediate concern is how to turn around United's form. Long term, his squad looks ill-suited to his preferred system.",

      "\u00c1gnes Keleti, a Holocaust survivor and the oldest living Olympic medal winner, has died at age 103",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- \u00c1gnes Keleti, a Holocaust survivor and the oldest living Olympic medal winner, has died. She was 103.",
      "Keleti died Thursday morning in Budapest, the Hungarian state news agency reported. She was hospitalized in critical condition with pneumonia on Dec. 25.",
      "She won a total of 10 Olympic medals in gymnastics, including five golds, for Hungary at the 1952 Helsinki Games and the 1956 Melbourne Games. She overcame the loss of her father and several relatives in the Holocaust to become one of the most successful Jewish Olympic athletes.",
      "\u201cThese 100 years felt to me like 60,\u201d Keleti told The Associated Press on the eve of her 100th birthday. \u201cI live well. And I love life. It\u2019s great that I\u2019m still healthy.\u201d",
      "Born \u00c1gnes Klein in 1921 in Budapest, her career was interrupted by World War II and the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics. Forced off her gymnastics team in 1941 because of her Jewish ancestry, Keleti went into hiding in the Hungarian countryside, where she survived the Holocaust by assuming a false identity and working as a maid.",
      "Her mother and sister survived the war with the help of famed Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, but her father and other relatives perished at Auschwitz, among the more than half a million Hungarian Jews killed in Nazi death camps and by Hungarian Nazi collaborators.",
      "Resuming her career after the war, Keleti was set to compete at the 1948 London Olympics, but a last-minute ankle injury dashed her hopes.",
      "Four years later, she made her Olympic debut at the 1952 Helsinki Games at the age of 31, winning a gold medal in the floor exercise as well as a silver and two bronzes. In 1956, she became the most successful athlete at the Melbourne Olympics, winning four gold and two silver medals.",
      "While she was becoming the oldest gold medalist in gymnastics history at age 35 in Melbourne, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary following an unsuccessful anti-Soviet uprising. Keleti remained in Australia and sought political asylum. She then immigrated to Israel the following year and worked as a trainer and coached the Israeli Olympic gymnastics team until the 1990s."

      "Golf is moving indoors like never before",
      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Xander Schauffele is making his season debut twice in the span of seven days at venues separated by a lot more than some 5,000 miles.",
      "One is at The Sentry, the season opener on the PGA Tour that starts Thursday on hilly terrain in Maui with endless views of the Pacific Ocean. Schauffele knows what to expect at Kapalua having won the tournament six years ago with a 62 in the final round.",
      "The other starts next Tuesday inside a 250,000-square-foot building on the campus of Palm Beach State College, a technological wonder when it comes to golf and a game that will only look familiar because of the players involved.",
      "This one makes Schauffele curiously excited.",
      "It's the debut of the TMRW Golf League, a six-team league featuring Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy among 24 players \u2014 13 of them major champions \u2014 in fast-paced, two-hour matches to be televised in prime time on ESPN platforms.",
      "\u201cI've been in there twice and played a mock match, and there was still a wow factor \u2014 even the second time around with lights and the stadium and really big screens,\u201d said Schauffele, who plays for New York Golf Club.",
      "\u201cIt's different from what they'll see from a conventional standpoint.\u201d",
      "It's team golf played indoors in the SoFi Center, a combination of simulator golf and actual shots to a huge putting surface that can rotate 360 degrees to change angles and slopes for different shots.",
      "New York takes on The Bay Golf Club (San Francisco) in the opener Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST. Three players from the four-man teams compete in 15-hole matches \u2014 nine holes of alternate shot and six holes of singles, with each player going two holes.",
      "Woods and his Jupiter Links face Los Angeles on Jan. 14. The schedule was created to mesh with players' tour schedule. The top four teams advance to the playoffs, and the best-of-3 championship series is two weeks before the Masters.",
      "The team winning the SoFi Cup gets $9 million.",
      "TGL is a product of TMRW Sports, the entertainment group of which Woods and McIlroy are co-founders. It hopes to appeal to a new audience, and even traditionalists, in an arena that can hold 1,500 fans.",
      "Players hit off real grass (or sand, the same used in bunkers at Augusta National) from 35 yards away into a screen 64 feet wide and 53 feet high. Architects have pitched in to design 30 holes that will be used at given times during the competition. For shots 50 yards or closer, players hit actual shots into the green.",
      "The TV window is two hours, and the competition includes a 40-second shot clock. This should move quickly, another element that sets it apart from traditional golf.",
      "\u201cIt's nothing like we've ever seen before, especially in golf,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "\u201cI see this as being complementary to everything else that is going on in the world of golf,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm still a traditionalist in a lot of ways. ... But I think there are certain things that we can do to innovate and try to appeal to a different and younger demographic, especially trying to condense it into a time frame that is a little bit more digestible and putting it on at a time where we\u2019re maybe going to get a few more eyeballs.\u201d",
      "TGL is a year behind schedule. It was supposed to debut at the start of 2024 until a power outage caused damage to the inflatable dome structure. With another year to plan, organizers went with a permanent arena that features locker rooms, dazzling lights and the massive screen. Electronic boards on both sides of the screen show the score, shot clock and yardages.",
      "The entire playing area is nearly the size of a football field.",
      "Simulator golf? Billy Horschel (Atlanta Drive GC) says that makes it sound like a gimmick, and he says TGL is more than that.",
      "\u201cWe're hitting off real grass, we\u2019re hitting real shots. We\u2019re playing on some artificial surface, but there\u2019s a lot of technology that\u2019s gone into this,\u201d Horschel said. \"We want to make it different than what people are seeing on the golf course. This is supposed to be different. It\u2019s supposed to be new, it\u2019s supposed to be fast, engaging, in a two-hour window when you\u2019re going to be able to see every golf shot.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to see guys more engaging than they would be on a PGA Tour event.\u201d",
      "Players will wear microphones. They will be presented with yardage and wind conditions before each shot. Winning a hole is worth one point (no carryovers for a halve).",
      "The six teams are Atlanta Drive, New York, Los Angeles, The Bay (San Francisco), Boston Common and Jupiter Links.",
      "Team ownership has power brokers that include Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank (Atlanta Drive), Fenway Sports Group (Boston), Stephen Curry and former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry (Bay) and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen (New York). Serena and Venus Williams are part owners of Los Angeles.",
      "It's night golf, sandwiched between college basketball on Monday and Tuesday nights. It's team golf. And it's indoor golf, the most unusual aspect of all.",
      "\u201cIt's a brand new concept, a brand new presentation of golf. There's something exciting about seeing what that's going to be like and being on the ground floor,\u201d said Patrick Cantlay, part of the Atlanta Drive team.",
      "\u201cIt gives a chance for a different perspective on people watching PGA Tour players,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be more personable, more action-packed. And I think the stadium they built is extremely impressive \u2014 impressive in person, and an impressive feat of engineering.\u201d",

      "Well-traveled guard Buddy Hield has found a good fit in the Bay Area with the Golden State Warriors shooting alongside Stephen Curry",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Buddy Hield hollers through the locker room at Stephen Curry with some good-natured banter or cracks jokes at practice and on the team plane, by all accounts leaving everyone in hysterics.",
      "From the moment Hield joined the Golden State Warriors last summer, he exhibited a tireless training regimen, too \u2014 one that has impressed Curry.",
      "\u201cHe probably puts more hours in the gym than I think I\u2019ve ever seen anybody,\u201d Curry said.",
      "The two-time NBA MVP is enjoying the high-energy personality, team-first dedication along with his new Warriors backcourt mate's love for his craft.",
      "From Freeport in the Bahamas to the Bay Area, the 32-year-old Hield takes great pride in representing his island nation on the big NBA stage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Hield said. \u201cIt\u2019s not by chance. I\u2019ve put the work in, for sure. I\u2019m just blessed and honored to be in this position.\u201d",
      "Hield is averaging 12.6 points and shooting nearly 43% from the field with the Warriors, but he also is making his presence felt off the court.",
      "When Hield arrives anywhere with the Warriors, he offers his hellos with that signature smile and instantly lifts the spirits of his new team. It's the kind of joy and focus coach Steve Kerr has long insisted defines the Warriors franchise.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing even-keel about him, he is all extreme happy, joy, talking all the time, and you love that energy because he loves the game,\u201d Curry said. \u201c... He does bring joy to the locker room, to the plane. No matter where we\u2019re at, you\u2019re going to hear him and he lifts everybody up because he\u2019s got a great sense of humor and he\u2019s been around the block. The funniest part is you just can\u2019t get him to shut up. So you appreciate everything he brings.\u201d",
      "His teammates call him Buddy Love, Buddy Fresh and Buddy Buckets \u2014 the nickname Buddy has been with the shooting guard since just after his birth, as Hield's formal first name is Chavano.",
      "Hield became the 17th player in NBA history to reach 2,000 3-pointers, and he sparks the offense with the way he runs the floor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just got to keep moving and hopefully I\u2019m able to catch some of the greats,\" Hield said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to catch Steph, but I hope to catch some of the greats and hopefully I can crack top-10, maybe top-five.\u201d",
      "That would be just fine with Kerr.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re playing fast and with a lot of pace, and that\u2019s what Buddy does really well,\" Kerr said. \u201cHe runs the floor in transition probably better than anybody on our team.\u201d",
      "The Warriors (16-16) have been struggling lately, losing three of their last 10.",
      "But you won't hear complaints from Hield, who has enjoyed an impressive run \u2014 from shooting as a youngster on a makeshift hoop that he and his brother Chevez constructed from a milk crate to helping lead Oklahoma to a Final Four in college and now as a journeyman in his ninth NBA season with a fifth different team.",
      "\"Where I came from in the Bahamas, I couldn\u2019t write a better script than this, just being down there, shooting on an outside court, building my own court right from a crate. To have 2,000 3s, I know the young kids back home and the people that helped me get to this point will really appreciate that.",
      "\"So I\u2019m just blessed to be in this situation.\u201d",
      "Hield landed with Golden State following Klay Thompson\u2019s departure to Dallas, and it's something Bahamas teammate Thompson called \u201cvery special.\u201d",
      "\"I\u2019m just happy they replaced me with another Bahamian,\u201d he said.",
      "And Thompson certainly realizes what Hield means to the Bahamas and helping build basketball back home.",
      "\u201cAre you kidding me? He\u2019s a legend, especially around Freeport. Buddy gives young men and women hope all over the nation,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEspecially his commitment to the national team, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d",
      "Hield's shooting has been inconsistent, but the Warriors are seeing everything he brings on and off the court. And that doesn't waver whether he's hitting shots or missing them, or starting or coming off the bench.",
      "\"He lifts this team every day when he comes in smiling,\u201d guard Gary Payton II said. \u201cI know that smile travels all the way back to the Bahamas and those kids have the same smile when he\u2019s on the court. ... How he plays and what he does, it\u2019s kind of like a Steph effect over there in the islands. They\u2019re shouting Buddy. We know what he means to this team and what he means to the Bahamas.\u201d",

      "PASADENA, Calif. -- Jeremiah Smith caught two of Will Howard\u2019s three long touchdown passes during Ohio State\u2019s sensational 34-point first half, and the No. 6 Buckeyes roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 41-21 victory over No. 1 Oregon in the 111th Rose Bowl Game on Wednesday night.",
      "Howard passed for 319 yards, Emeka Egbuka also caught a long TD pass and TreVeyon Henderson made a 66-yard touchdown run in a redemptive Rose Bowl for the Buckeyes (12-2, CFP No. 8 seed), whose big-game execution sometimes hasn't matched their formidable talent this season.",
      "Ohio State has seized the second chances created by the first 12-team CFP, emphatically blowing out the tournament's No. 1 seed. The Buckeyes scored on six of their first seven drives and took a 34-0 lead late in the second quarter on the nation\u2019s only remaining unbeaten team in the Granddaddy of Them All.",
      "Ohio State is headed to the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 10 to face No. 4 Texas for a berth in the national title game. The Longhorns barely advanced earlier Wednesday, holding off Arizona State 39-31 in a double-overtime Peach Bowl.",
      "Dillon Gabriel passed for 299 yards and hit Traeshon Holden for two touchdowns for the Ducks (13-1, CFP No. 1 seed), whose dreams of their first national title were flattened on the famed Rose Bowl turf. Oregon's 14-game winning streak also ended.",
      "Eleven days after routing Tennessee to open the Playoff, Ohio State dominated this rematch of these Big Ten teams\u2019 regular-season thriller, won 32-31 by the Ducks in Eugene on Oct. 12. The Ohio State defense that couldn\u2019t sack Gabriel in the teams\u2019 first meeting dropped the Heisman Trophy finalist eight times in the rematch.",
      "Smith, the Buckeyes' standout freshman playmaker, had a remarkable bowl debut with seven receptions for 187 yards \u2014 including five catches for 161 yards in the first half alone, hauling in scoring passes of 45 and 43 yards.",
      "Ohio State turned the CFP\u2019s most anticipated quarterfinal matchup into a long celebration at the Rose Bowl, which has hosted several thrilling, close games in recent Januaries. This one pitted two powerhouse programs widely considered to have the top two teams left in the inaugural 12-team Playoff, but the Buckeyes scored early and often at the Rose Bowl.",
      "The Big Ten champion Ducks couldn\u2019t make any offensive headway until they trailed by 34 points, failing to create any of the big plays that carried the Ducks to victory in Eugene.",
      "After the usual pregame pageantry in 70-degree sunshine at the venerable stadium in Arroyo Seco, Ohio State needed just three plays and 49 seconds to strike first. Howard threw a short play-action screen pass to Smith, who motored through Oregon\u2019s secondary for a 45-yard score.",
      "On the Buckeyes\u2019 third drive, Howard feathered an exceptional long pass over three Ducks to the sprinting Egbuka for a 42-yard TD. Howard finished the first quarter with a career-best 212 yards passing, surpassing his 160 yards during Ohio State\u2019s hot start against Tennessee.",
      "Early in the second quarter, Smith got so open near the Ducks\u2019 goal line that he had two seconds to settle under Howard\u2019s long throw like an outfielder with a fly ball, scoring a 42-yard TD untouched.",
      "When Henderson broke a 66-yard TD run down the Oregon sideline for a 31-0 lead, both sides of the Rose Bowl stands rippled with disbelief.",
      "Oregon finally got moving on its final drive before halftime. Gabriel found Holden for a 5-yard TD pass at the gun, and the Ducks added a two-point conversion to salvage something from their horrific half.",
      "The Ducks drove for Noah Whittington\u2019s 2-yard TD run to open the second half, scoring the first touchdown allowed in the third quarter all season by Ohio State. Oregon even forced a punt moments later to stir faint hope in its fans, but the Ohio State defense drove the Buckeyes backward for a punt before Howard\u2019s group methodically drove for Henderson\u2019s second TD.",
      "Ohio State: The full force of the Buckeyes' talent has been on display for the past two weeks after it fell short against Oregon and Michigan in the regular season. The 12-team playoff opened the chance for redemption. This group is seizing it, and it's awfully fun to watch.",
      "Oregon: Having 3 1/2 weeks off with their first-round bye proved to be dangerous for the Ducks. This disconcerting flop doesn't completely ruin a breakthrough Big Ten debut, but the season will always loom as a missed opportunity in Oregon history.",
      "Ohio State: The Cotton Bowl will be a preview of both teams\u2019 2025 season opener, since Texas visits Ohio Stadium on Aug. 30.",

      "HOUSTON -- Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair said he was in a \u201creally dark place\u201d and wondered if he\u2019d ever play football again in the days after he was suspended for three games for his hit on Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence that left the quarterback with a concussion.",
      "Speaking to reporters Wednesday for the first time since the suspension, Al-Shaair discussed his state of mind during his absence.",
      "\u201cThe things that you can think when somebody says they\u2019re in a dark place, as dark as you can go is where I was truthfully,\u201d he said.",
      "Al-Shaair added that \u201cit was hard for me to see myself playing football again\u201d before he met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and league executives Troy Vincent and Jon Runyan.",
      "Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair in what escalated into a brawl.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field after being ejected, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet.",
      "Al-Shaair said that he understood the suspension, but disagreed with how he was characterized by Runyan in the letter informing him of the punishment. It included Runyan telling Al-Shaair: \u201cYour lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach, and enjoy watching it, is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL.\u201d",
      "He said he needed to talk to Runyan and other NFL executives to understand how they viewed him as a player before he could return to the field.",
      "\u201cI really had a moment of, there\u2019s no way I can go out and play football again if this is how people that I work with view me,\u201d Al-Shaair said.",
      "He said Runyan told him that he was watching the play and the ensuing melee when he wrote the letter and that he was only referring to those moments and not his entire career in his comments about his sportsmanship.",
      "\u201cBut the way he typed it, he said got obviously taken out of context,\u201d Al-Shaair said. \u201cI clearly made a mistake (and) the reason why he typed something which ended up being taken out of context as a mistake is because I did something that was obviously not right, me taking my helmet off and me starting another brawl ... wasn\u2019t right.",
      "\u201cBut everything prior to that I stand on the fact that I never tried to hurt him,\u201d he continued.",
      "Al-Shaair said he sat in a room not doing anything for about five days after his suspension.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a blur,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat nothing. I didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d",
      "By Friday of that week, some children at a foster care organization in Tennessee that he had met last year when he played for the Titans sent him messages of encouragement.",
      "\u201cI got so many different messages like that and I remember just sitting in my bed and I was like: \u2018Man, like I can just keep sitting here sad and sulking and just feeling like I\u2019m being misjudged or I can just do what I always do, which is just try to be positive and spread positivity, do the best that I can,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He booked a plane ticket to Nashville and got there in time to attend the same event at the foster care organization that he\u2019d attended the previous year.",
      "\u201cI had so many people saying so many negative things and to see people that were happy to see me and were happy about my presence I think that\u2019s what kind of like snapped me back,\u201d Al-Shaair said. \u201cLike regardless of what\u2019s being said, you know who you are and just lean into that and ... from there just crawling myself out of this place.\u201d",
      "When the AFC South champion Texans (9-7) face the Titans on Sunday, he'll return for the first time since the hit on Lawrence, and coach DeMeco Ryans is thrilled to have him back. The Texans have been hit hard by injuries and are limping into the playoffs after two straight losses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve missed him over these past three weeks, just missed his presence, his leadership, missed his playmaking ability on the field,\u201d Ryans said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re excited to get him back out there and let him knock some of the rust off.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- The Peach Bowl referee declined to call a targeting penalty late in the fourth quarter for a helmet-to-helmet hit by Texas safety Michael Taaffe that could've given Arizona State a chance to kick a winning field goal in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals Wednesday.",
      "The fourth-ranked Longhorns went on to beat the No. 10 Sun Devils 39-31 in double overtime after Texas squandered a 16-point lead in the final period of regulation.",
      "The big hit by Taaffe came after Texas missed a field goal attempt with 1:39 remaining that left the game tied at 24-all. Taking over, Arizona State faced third-and-15 from its own 38 when Sam Leavitt delivered a short pass over the middle to Melquan Stovall.",
      "Taaffe arrived about the time Stovall made the 10-yard reception, their helmets clearly hitting, and the Arizona State receiver was left sprawled on the turf.",
      "No flag was thrown, but referee Larry Smith of the Big Ten conference halted play to check the replay for possible targeting. As Stovall was being helped off the field, Smith announced there was no penalty, leaving Arizona State with fourth-and-5 at its own 48.",
      "If targeting had been called, a 15-yard penalty would have given the Sun Devils a first down at the Texas 37. Instead, they punted the ball away.",
      "Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham argued with the officials on the sideline. It was clear he didn't agree with the call after one of his own players, star defensive back Shamari Simmons, had to sit out the first half after being ejected from the Big 12 championship game for a targeting penalty.",
      "Texas took advantage of Simmons' replacement, Montana Warren, to hit two long passes for a touchdown on its opening possession.",
      "\u201cI'm going to be honest, I don't know what targeting is,\u201d Dillingham said. \u201cWe lost one of our best players in the first half for targeting, and I just don't know what it is.\u201d",
      "Targeting generally refers to a player delivering a hit while leading with the crown of his helmet. While Taaffe's helmet undoubtedly hit Stovall's, it didn't appear the Texas player lowered his head.",
      "Dillingham said he's baffled by the targeting rule.",
      "\u201cI don't want to comment on something that I have to get a better grasp on what it is,\" the coach said. \u201cI just don't quite understand it. I do want to protect the players, though. So whatever rules are put in place to protect the players, I'm all about it.\u201d",

      "If the Denver Broncos are embracing the opportunity to face Carson Wentz instead of Patrick Mahomes on Sunday, they're not saying so publicly",
      "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The Denver Broncos aren't necessarily breathing any easier knowing they won't have to face Patrick Mahomes and several other Kansas City Chiefs starters on Sunday with a playoff berth on the line.",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid announced his decision to rest Mahomes on Wednesday, but declined to say who else might spend the day with the three-time Super Bowl MVP on the sideline in Denver with Kansas City having already secured the AFC's top seed.",
      "There's a good chance, though, that superstar defensive tackle Chris Jones (strained calf) will sit this one out. And the same could go for running back Isiah Pacheco (bruised ribs), right tackle Jawaan Taylor (sore knee) and veteran tight end Travis Kelce, who similarly skipped last year\u2019s Week 18 game, among others.",
      "\u201cWe have to play the game to win, that's all that matters,\u201d Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton said. \u201cWe don't care about none of the other stuff. Whoever has on shoulder pads and is wearing red, white and yellow, we have to beat them boys.",
      "\u201cWe don't care who shows up and plays,\u201d Sutton continued. \u201cWe don't care who sits. We don't care who doesn't play, who does play. We don't care about any of that. The Denver Broncos have to show up Sunday and win the game.\u201d",
      "If they do, the Broncos (9-7) will clinch a playoff berth for the first time since winning Super Bowl 50 in Peyton Manning's final game on Feb. 7. 2016.",
      "The franchise has churned through half a dozen coaches and more than a dozen starting quarterbacks since hoisting the team's third Lombardi Trophy nearly nine years ago.",
      "The Chiefs (15-1) won three games in an 11-day stretch culminating with a 29-10 win at Pittsburgh on Christmas Day that secured the conference's first-round bye as they seek a three-peat as Super Bowl champions. Reid is using the finale as a chance to rest some of his starters, who will have more than a three-week break by the time they return to the field for an AFC divisional-round game on either Jan. 18 or 19.",
      "\u201cYou know, a credit to Kansas City, Andy and his team,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cWhen you go 15-1, then you're afforded those decisions and I've been in that position where your team might need a break here or there. They've earned that and that's part of the deal. For us, it's about understanding what we're seeing scheme-wise and being ready to play our best game.\u201d",
      "The Broncos blew chances to wrap up a playoff berth with road losses to the Los Angeles Chargers and Cincinnati Bengals the last two weeks. But they're embracing the moment as they control their own destiny with a win-and-in game at home Sunday.",
      "\u201cYou could say that it would have been nice to be able to go into this game and have your position locked in,\u201d Sutton said, \u201cbut in terms of a storybook thing that you couldn't really write up any better, I think this is the best opportunity that we could have to go in and solidify why we deserve to be in the dance.\u201d",
      "The Broncos could back into the playoffs even if they lose to the Chiefs or tie them Sunday if Cincinnati loses to Pittsburgh on Saturday and the Miami Dolphins lose to the New York Jets on Sunday.",
      "They're not relying on anybody else punching their playoff ticket, though.",
      "\u201cWe gotta win the game, simple,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThere's nothing that goes into it. We gotta win the game. People say it's never black and white \u2014 it's black and white. We gotta win the game. And that's as simple as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Broncos snapped a 16-game losing streak to the Chiefs with a 24-9 win in Denver last season, and they were on the verge of beating Kansas City in Week 10 at Arrowhead Stadium when the Chiefs blocked a 33-yard field goal as time expired to preserve a 16-14 victory.",
      "In the aftermath of that heartbreaker, the Broncos flipped Alex Forsyth and Matt Peart on the left side of their field goal protection unit. Kicker Wil Lutz has gone 12 of 12 on field goals and 22 of 22 on extra points since then.",

      "ATLANTA -- Texas avoided the first big upset of the College Football Playoff, hitting a fourth-and-long touchdown pass to keep the game going and beating Cam Skattebo and Arizona State 39-31 in double overtime when an interception by Andrew Mukuba finally ended a Peach Bowl quarterfinal classic Wednesday.",
      "Skattebo led the Sun Devils back from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter and put his team ahead for the first time all day with a 3-yard touchdown run to start overtime against No. 4 Texas (13-2).",
      "No. 10 Arizona State \u2014 a two-touchdown underdog according to BetMGM Sportsbook \u2014 was on the verge of winning when Texas faced fourth-and-13 on its first overtime possession. But Quinn Ewers found Matthew Golden breaking free behind two defenders to haul in a 28-yard touchdown.",
      "After moving to the opposite end of Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Ewers threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Gunnar Helms on the very next play, followed by a 2-point conversion pass to Golden.",
      "The Longhorns finally put Arizona State (11-3) away when Mukuba picked off Sam Leavitt's pass at the 3 to end the game.",
      "After a bunch of lopsided results through the first five games of the expanded 12-team playoff, the format finally produced a classic that sends Texas back home for a Cotton Bowl semifinal on Jan. 10 against No. 1 Oregon or No. 6 Ohio State, who were facing off in the Rose Bowl on Wednesday.",
      "Despite being dominated on the stat sheet most of the game, the Longhorns had a seemingly comfortable 24-8 lead after scoring two early touchdowns and getting a 5-yard scoring run from Ewers with just over 10 minutes remaining.",
      "But Skattebo and the Sun Devils were just getting warmed up.",
      "The running back who calls himself the best in the nation, Skattebo backed up his bravado with a performance for the ages, showing every facet of his all-around game.",
      "First, he took a pitch on fourth-and-2 and heaved a 42-yard touchdown pass to Malik McClain that gave the Sun Devils a chance when they made the 2-point conversion.",
      "Then, Skattebo broke loose down the sideline and hauled in a 62-yard throw from Leavitt \u2014 getting his helmet ripped off at the end of the play, which seemed like the only way to bring him down.",
      "That set up a 2-yard touchdown run by the bowling ball of a back, and it was only appropriate that Skattebo also powered in for the 2-point conversion that tied the game at 24 with 5 minutes remaining.",
      "Texas had a pair of chances to win in regulation, but Bert Auburn was wide right on a 48-yard field goal attempt and clanked one off the left upright from 38 yards away as time expired.",

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to pers...",
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two deadly incidents on New Year's Day \u2014 an attack being investigated as an act of terrorism in New Orleans and an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 both involved vehicles that were rented on Turo, a peer-to-peer car sharing company.",
      "Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter \u2014 killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight. Just hours after, outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives also burst into flames. The person inside, identified as active-duty U.S. Army Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, died. Officials later said he suffered a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion.",
      "Turo said it is \u201cshocked and saddened\" Wednesday's events and that \u201cour hearts are with the victims and their families.\"",
      "The company added that is \"outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\u201d",
      "While both incidents involved vehicles rented through Turo, the FBI has said that is has found \u201cno definitive link\u201d between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.",
      "Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car-sharing platform. Here's what we know about Turo.",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or \u201cguests.\u201d \u201cHosts\u201d set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo's website or app.",
      "Billing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest car sharing marketplace\" today, Turo says it operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",
      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 13:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "He pleaded guilty to federal fraud, campaign finance and embezzlement charges.",
      "Disgraced former Congressman George Santos asked a judge on Friday to delay his sentencing in his federal fraud case.",
      "Santos is currently scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 7 in Central Islip, New York, after pleading guilty to federal fraud, campaign finance and embezzlement charges.",
      "His attorneys asked the judge to postpone the sentencing by six months, until August, to give Santos more time to make money so he can meet the nearly $600,000 he owes in restitution and forfeiture, according to a new court filing.",
      "\"Mr. Santos now has a viable path to making meaningful progress on satisfying his obligations,\" his lawyers stated in a motion filed on Friday, citing the launch of a new podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors did not immediately respond, though the defense noted that the government opposes a delay.",

      "He told reporters at the time that the guilty plea was the \"right thing to do.\"",
      "\"This plea is not just an admission of guilt,\" Santos said. \"It's an acknowledgment that I need to be held accountable like any other American that breaks the law.\"",
      "Santos also stipulated that he committed other fraud, including charging donor credit cards without authorization and convincing donors to give money by falsely stating the money would be used for TV ads.

      "\"Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure,\" Biden said in a statement.",
      "The move marks the latest effort on the part of the Biden administration to protect U.S. markets from foreign-owned firms.",
      "Biden has preserved many of the tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump, and he enacted a law that would ban China-based social media platform TikTok later this month if the company doesn't find a new parent company. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments this month in a legal challenge brought by TikTok.",
      "Nippon Steel sharply criticized the decision in a statement on Friday, suggesting the company may take legal action.",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden\u2019s decision to block Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U. S. Steel,\" Nippon Steel said. \"The President\u2019s statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "\"Following President Biden\u2019s decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights,\" the company added.",
      "The decision comes weeks after a federal committee declined to issue a recommendation on the U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel merger, leaving Biden an opportunity to block the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, tasked with a review of the potential acquisition, shared concerns about the national security risks posed by the loss of the country's second-largest steel producer.",

      "Three newly elected lawmakers representing the LGBTQ community will make history Friday when they are sworn in to the 119th Congress, marking several firsts in the House of Representatives.",
      "Sarah McBride will be the first openly transgender member of Congress. She will represent Delaware\u2019s sole congressional district in the House of Representatives after more than three years in the state Senate, which marked a historic first for trans representation at the state senate level.",
      "Julie Johnson, set to be the first LGBTQ+ member of Congress from the South, had served in the Texas state legislature since 2018. In her campaign for the congressional seat, she touted her record in fighting anti-LGBTQ bills on the state level among her passions as a legislator.",
      "Emily Randall will be the first LGBTQ Latina in Congress after serving as a Washington state senator since 2018.",
      "The 118th Congress set the record for having the most LGBTQ representation in U.S. history, with 13 legislators openly identifying as gay, lesbian or bisexual. This year's slate of members being sworn in are doing so as the country experiences growing anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and violence.",
      "In the 2024 state legislative session, the ACLU tracked more than 500 bills they say are \"anti-LGBTQ.\" Transgender people -- who make up less than 1% of Americans over the age of 13, according to UCLA's research organization, the Williams Institute -- have particularly been the subjects of such legislation, including restrictions on bathroom use for transgender residents, bans on gender-affirming care, and more.",
      "In recent years, federal and local authorities have warned about the increase in violence against the LGBTQ community.",
      "McBride has received backlash from some colleagues ahead of her swearing in. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduced a bill in November to restrict transgender women from using women's restrooms at the U.S. Capitol, saying the bill was \"absolutely\" in response to McBride's entering Congress. She cited concerns about her safety in restrooms, to which McBride responded by calling the bill a distraction. The bill is now dead.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said transgender women cannot use women's restrooms, changing rooms or locker rooms in the Capitol and House office buildings. In terms of how Johnson plans to enforce this policy is not entirely clear if he's elected Speaker again, but the speaker has \"general control\" of facilities, according to House rules.",
      "McBride responded to the order by saying, \"I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:35:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Sen. John Thune used his first few minutes of floor time to make a commitment to defend the filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes to pass Senate legislation.",
    "story": [
      "Thune's comments came just after the Senate gaveled in to begin its new session.",
      "In his maiden floor speech as Senate majority leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota used his first few minutes of floor time to make a commitment to defend the filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes to pass legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,\" Thune said. \"That means preserving the legislative filibuster, the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact on preserving the founders' visions of the United States Senate.\"",
      "Thune's comments came just after the Senate gaveled in to begin its new session.",
      "During the opening of the new Congress, Vice President Kamala Harris swore in all 32 Senators elected in November, including 12 freshman members, some of whom helped to deliver a new Republican majority in the upper chamber.",
      "In this new Senate, Republicans have 53 seats, a three-seat majority that gives them a comfortable edge in confirming President-elect Donald Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and the federal bench since these nominations only require 50 votes for confirmation.",
      "But the Senate rules currently require 60 votes to pass legislation. If Thune holds true to his commitment to uphold this rule, that means the majority of legislative matters will require the buy-in of at least seven Senate Democrats or independents who caucus with Democrats. It keeps compromise front and center in the upper chamber.",
      "Thune's speech Friday afternoon is not the first time that he has made a commitment to uphold the Senate's 60-vote threshold, which Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to sidestep to pass voting rights legislation in 2022. Thune made the protection of the filibuster part of his campaign to become majority leader and has since spoken on the floor to the same.",
      "But the fact that Thune, who will no doubt undergo scrutiny from Trump for any failure to move his legislative agenda across the finish line swiftly, chose to use his first moments on the Senate floor as Republican leader to affirm his commitment to the 60-vote threshold is notable.",
      "Trump attempted to pressure Republicans to put the legislative filibuster rule aside in 2018, when Trump was in office for the first time and Republicans controlled the Senate. It was then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who prevented the Senate from taking that step. Democrats similarly signaled last year that they were interested in exploring a revision of the rule if they managed to keep control of the Senate, which they did not.",
      "Thune's comments on the floor today signal that he won't cave to Trump if the president-elect grows frustrated by the Senate's inability to swiftly move legislation that does not have any Democratic support and once again mounts a pressure campaign to change the rule.",
      "\"Unfortunately, today there are a lot of people out there who would like to see the Senate turn into a copy of the House of Representatives, and that is not what our founders intended or what our country needs,\" Thune said.",
      "Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a challenge to cobble together.",
      "All other legislation will require 60 votes to pass.",
      "Thune said the Senate will have a laundry list of things it hopes to accomplish during the 119th Congress, including border security, tax reform, defense spending changes and larger government funding discussions.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is now the minority leader in this new Senate, said Democrats will do their part to try to work with Republicans where possible, citing a string of bipartisan wins in previous years.",
      "\"I want to work with the new Republican leader to keep that bipartisan streak going in the new year,\" Schumer said. \"I don't expect we will agree on everything or even many things, but there will still be opportunities to improve the lives of the American people if we are willing to work together.\"",
      "Schumer, who spoke out repeatedly against Trump prior to the 2024 election, said Democrats are ready to move forward from the election.",
      "\"For first time in a long time, the next president will be someone we've seen before: President-elect Trump will return to the Oval Office,\" Schumer said. \"In the first day of the 119th Congress, I'd like to take a moment to talk about how Senate Democrats will approach the next two years. It can be summarized like this: Democrats stand united not because of who we fight against but because of who we are fighting for -- the American people.\"",
      "He also congratulated Thune on his assumption of the role as majority leader.",
      "Thune fills the role of McConnell, who stepped down from leadership after 18 years at the helm of the Senate Republican Conference. Friday was Thune's first day as party leader despite winning an election to the position in November.",
      "Thune said he will \"work every day\" to be worthy of the trust his party members have put in him as their new leader.",

      "The inquiries followed reports of impropriety by Hegseth, which he denies.",
      "Following reports of alleged impropriety by Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have quietly made a request for additional information from the veterans organization Hegseth once ran, as well as the district attorney in Monterey County, California, according to communications reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The committee appears to be looking deeper into recently reported accusations of a 2017 sexual assault as well as allegations of financial misconduct on Hegseth's part, both of which Hegseth has denied.",
      "The allegations have created an uphill climb for the former Fox News host, who can only afford to lose the votes of three Senate Republicans when his confirmation comes up for a vote in the coming weeks.",
      "The committee's requests, which were made in early December, ask that documents be provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee no later than Monday, Jan. 6, just over a week before Hegseth is scheduled to appear before the panel for his public confirmation hearing on Jan. 14.",
      "The requests, reviewed by ABC News, show that the top Republican on the committee, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and the top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., sought additional information from the Monterey County district attorney concerning allegations of sexual assault that were levied against Hegseth in 2017 and first reported in November, following Trump's announcement of Hegseth as his DOD pick.",
      "The Monterey Police Department released a report last month detailing how a woman told investigators in October 2017 that she had encountered Hegseth at an event afterparty at a California hotel where both had been drinking, and claimed that he sexually assaulted her.",
      "When police approached Hegseth as part of their investigation, he denied the accusation and \"stated that the engagement ... was mutual,\" the police report said.",
      "No charges were filed, although Hegseth subsequently paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement, which Hegseth's attorney said was only because Hegseth feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public. The agreement stated that Hegseth made no admission of wrongdoing in the matter.",
      "Though the police report was made public in November, sources said members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were seeking any evidence beyond what was included in the report, as well as any documents containing legal analysis or recommendations.",
      "The Monterey County District Attorney responded to the committee's request on Dec. 20, informing the committee that the office did not have any additional evidence in the case beyond the publicly available police report, according to a letter from the DA's office to the committee obtained by ABC News.",
      "The DA did note, however, that -- while they possess only a case summary and a memo declining to prosecute Hegseth -- some of the other records the committee requested contain protected work by attorneys, and they declined to provide some of them due to their protected status.",
      "Spokespeople for both Wicker and Reed declined to comment to ABC News.",
      "In an interview with conservative media personality and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly in early December, Hegseth admitting to being in a hotel room with the woman but denied raping her.",
      "\"Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I've been honest about that encounter, starting with law enforcement,\" he said when asked if he had raped a woman.",
      "\"I may have been drinking, but I was cognizant enough to remember every single detail,\" he said. \"And I'm not here to say that my conduct was good -- you know, being in a hotel room with someone that's, you know, not the person you're with is not OK. I own up to that, and I've had to own up to that, and that's been difficult.\"",
      "The senators are also seeking information from Concerned Veterans for America, a veterans organization for which Hegseth was once CEO, after a New Yorker story contained allegations that Hegseth engaged in financial mismanagement and sexist behavior while at the helm of that organization. Hegseth has broadly denied the allegations.",
      "The committee has requested all documents related to Hegseth's employment, any financial records and tax returns related to his management position at the organization, and any written documentation alleging wrongdoing or misconduct by Hegseth.",
      "A representative for Concerned Veterans for America did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News.",
      "Reached by ABC News, Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, maintained that his client is innocent and said that Hegseth is \"cooperating fully with any requests for information from the committee.\"",
      "Trump publicly endorsed Hegseth last month after the allegations of misconduct initially got Hegseth a rocky reception on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Pete Hegseth is doing very well. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. \"Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!\"",
      "Wicker, who will oversee Hegseth's nomination hearing before the Armed Services Committee, has repeatedly signaled that he's interested in a thorough vetting of the candidate.",
      "In early December, amid speculation that Hegseth might not submit to a traditional FBI background check, Wicker told ABC News that it would be his preference to see such a background check carried out.",

      "\"State funerals are considered no-notice events that significantly reduce planning timelines for potential hostile actors,\" the document said. \"However, state funerals still present attractive targets due to the large gathering of senior US government officials, foreign dignitaries, and heads of state, as well as the symbolic nature of the venues and media attention expected.\"",

      "The assessment also noted other specially designated security events this month, including the certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The simultaneous events \"may increase the perception of a target-rich environment for a variety of threat actors,\" the document said.",
      "\"Targets could include the planned special events and ceremonies related to the State Funeral and associated First Amendment-protected activities around these ceremonies,\" the assessment said. \"While there is no indication that the intersection of these two events will lead to an increased threat picture, the potentially large crowds for both may provide an attractive target to threat actors.\"",

      "When Israelis and Palestinians finally came together to sign the Oslo Accords in 1993, the plan was similar to the one Carter had written 15 years earlier, with the creation of a Palestinian Authority and Israel\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories.",
      "But the peace process stalled out yet again in 2000, when the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement at Camp David. An armed Palestinian uprising erupted months later, and Israel launched a heavy military crackdown.",
      "Carter remained actively engaged in the Middle East as a global campaigner for human rights and democracy, with his Carter Center observing Palestinian elections. He spoke out against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, calling George W. Bush the worst president in the history of foreign affairs.",
      "In speeches, articles and a controversial book titled \u201cPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\u201d he called on the Palestinians to renounce violence and for U.S. intervention to end the conflict.",
      "But he reserved some of his strongest language for Israel\u2019s sprawling Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they were far more built-up than people knew and undermined hope for a negotiated solution to the century-old conflict.",
      "Most controversial was his contention that the situation in the West Bank \u2014 where some 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule alongside hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers who have full citizenship \u2014 amounts to apartheid.",
      "In a 2007 interview defending the book, Carter said the term was a \u201cvery accurate description\u201d of the \u201ctotal domination and oppression of Palestinians.\u201d",
      "Carter insisted the tough talk was coming from someone who had devoted his life to trying to bring about a lasting peace for Israel, but few Israelis saw it that way. Israel\u2019s supporters said the book was slanted against it and contained a number of inaccuracies.",
      "Israel bristles at any suggestion that its open-ended rule over the Palestinians amounts to apartheid, viewing it as an attack on its very legitimacy. It points to the fact that its own Arab minority has full citizenship, including the right to vote.",
      "Barak rejected the apartheid assertions, saying that as head of the Supreme Court he had presided over numerous rulings in favor of Palestinians against Israeli security bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s not apartheid,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was a complicated person,\u201d Barak said of Carter. \u201cBut on balance, I think he was a friend of Israel.\u201d",
      "The situation Carter described has only grown worse for the Palestinians. There have been no peace talks in well over a decade, Israel is rapidly expanding settlements, and its far-right government supports outright annexation of parts of the West Bank, making the establishment of a viable Palestinian state virtually impossible.",
      "Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem have meanwhile adopted Carter\u2019s language to describe the conflict, publishing lengthy reports in recent years arguing that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid.",
      "Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, said Carter\u2019s words were groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cToday, apartheid is the consensus within the global human rights movement and yet, despite the increasingly transparent reality on the ground, few leaders in the U.S. and Europe dare to utter the words President Carter did more than 16 years ago,\u201d Shakir said.",
      "In April 2008, an 83-year-old Carter toured the region with the Elders, a group of retired international leaders founded by Nelson Mandela. He once again courted controversy by meeting with the top leaders of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which had recently seized control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas does not accept Israel\u2019s existence and has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks over the years.",
      "But Carter said he had secured a personal commitment that Hamas would accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if the agreement were approved in a Palestinian referendum \u2014 a potentially big step toward accepting Israel.",
      "The Israeli government refused to meet with Carter, and both Israel and the U.S. criticized his decision to meet with Hamas.",
      "Israel and Hamas went on to fight five wars in Gaza, the deadliest of which was triggered by a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and is still ongoing.",
      "For Carter, now remembered the world over as a statesman and a humanitarian, the failure to resolve the conflict was a bitter disappointment.",
      "\u2018\u2019The most important single foreign policy goal in my life has been to bring peace to Israel, and peace and justice to Israel\u2019s neighbors,\u201d Carter told an Israeli newspaper during the 2008 visit.",
      "\u201cI have done everything I could in office and since I left office to do that.\u201d",

      "Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, will be honored with a state funeral at Washington National Cathedral on Thursday, Jan. 9. President Joe Biden is expected to deliver the eulogy.",
      "\"I'll be there. We were invited,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday night, though he declined to say if he'd spoken with any members of the Carter family.",
      "Trump's attendance at the funeral will come after years of public sniping between Trump and Carter, including Trump's recent jabs at Carter on the 2024 campaign trail.",
      "Though after the 39th president's passing, Trump issued a statement praising Carter's service to the country.",
      "\"The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,\" Trump wrote. \"Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time.

      "\"While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for. He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect,\" Trump wrote of Carter. \"He was a truly good man and, of course, will be greatly missed. He was also very consequential, far more than most Presidents, after he left the Oval Office.\"",
      "But previously, Trump had labelled Carter as the country's \"worst president.\"",
      "Trump also repeatedly criticized Carter as he lashed out at President Joe Biden when the two were opponents in the 2024 race before Biden dropped out.",
      "\"Crooked Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of our country. He's the most incompetent and he's the most corrupt president in the history of our country,\" Trump said last January as he ramped up campaign events. \"And it's not even close. In fact, I said, today, the happiest person alive today is Jimmy Carter because his presidency looks brilliant. Brilliant by comparison.\"",

      "During the presidential transition, Trump's denounced a signature achievement of Carter's presidency -- the Panama Canal Treaty that gave the Central American nation eventual control of the critical waterway. Trump recently said the U.S. \"foolishly\" ceded the Panama Canal and suggested his incoming administration might try to regain control of it.",
      "During Trump's first term, Carter didn't mince words when discussing what he thought about his presidency.",
      "Carter told the Washington Post in 2018, \"I think he's a disaster.\"",
      "\"In human rights and taking care of people and treating people equal,\" Carter said of Trump.",

      "House Republican leaders formally unveiled their new set of rules for the 119th Congress on Wednesday, which includes a provision that will make it harder to oust a speaker of the House but doesn\u2019t remove the threat.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson and other top Republicans previewed the change at a press conference in November following GOP leadership elections.",
      "Within the proposed rules package, the motion to vacate rule will now require a total of nine sponsors in order to be considered privileged on the House floor.",
      "\u201cA resolution causing a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker shall not be privileged except if it is offered by a member of the majority party and has accumulated eight co-sponsors from the majority party at the time it is offered,\u201d the rules package states.",
      "During the last Congress, a single lawmaker was able to force a vote to \u201cvacate the chair\u201d -- which former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz used to remove then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy and plunged the House into chaos for several weeks before Johnson was elected speaker. Historically, this had been the position of the House, but hard-right Republicans used the tool as a threat to remove then-Speaker John Boehner in 2015. Democrats ultimately changed the rules to require the majority of the House to support the motion when they controlled the House but McCarthy was forced to switch the rule back by hardliners when the GOP got the majority back.",
      "After a speaker is elected, the House will hold a vote on the rules package -- requiring a simple majority for passage. Democrats are not expected to help Republicans clear this package, so Johnson won\u2019t be able to afford many GOP defections. This is typically the House\u2019s second vote they\u2019ll take after the election of the speaker and swearing-in of members.",
      "Johnson's reelection as speaker is not a sure thing. The speaker vote comes after a number of House Republicans grew frustrated with Johnson during the final days of the 118th Congress, which saw a bitter fight over spending that nearly caused a government shutdown before Christmas.",
      "And while the nine-member threshold makes it harder to oust a speaker, it does not completely remove the threat.",
      "Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland and Main Street Caucus Chairman Dusty Johnson of South Dakota -- who negotiated the deal appeared with Johnson at a press conference where they explained the change in November.",
      "\"We had an opportunity to set the motion to vacate at a higher than number one, that motion to vacate will be set at nine in return for getting rid of some amendments that probably would have divided this conference,\" Dusty Johnson said.",
      "He said the agreement allows Republicans to be \"in a better position to move forward with the Republican agenda to make sure that Speaker Johnson, South Dakota Senate Leader John Thune and our President Donald Trump have an opportunity to go forward.\"",
      "\"For me this is exactly how we're supposed to come together,\" Dusty Johnson said.",

      "\"We've been able to work across the conference to eliminate the controversial issues that could have divided us and move forward together to deliver on the President's agenda. That's it,\" Harris said.",
      "Earlier this year, Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to vacate the speaker's chair, threatening to oust Johnson just months after he ascended to the speakership. When she officially triggered a vote on her motion to oust Johnson, Democrats joined almost all Republicans to overwhelmingly reject her move.",

      "He's set to chair the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.",
      "Sixty years after Black Americans gained the right to vote in the United States through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Sen. Tim Scott on Friday makes history, becoming the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the United States Senate. This historic moment will be shared alongside four other African-American senators, making this the largest group of Black senators to ever serve concurrently in the U.S. Capitol, a building constructed with the labor of enslaved Black people.",
      "The previous longest-serving Black senator was the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who held office from 1967 until 1979. Scott, the first elected Black senator from the South, is the first to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "In his first speech as a freshman senator, Scott said, \"I believe in the greatness of America because I have experienced the goodness of our people in America. An ordinary guy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this.\"",
      "Born and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott was raised in a single-parent household after the divorce of his parents. He was a troubled teenager who failed English, Spanish, geography, and civics in his freshman year in High School. He often recalls his close relationship with his grandfather, who was forced to drop out of school in the third grade, picked cotton to survive, and was not allowed to vote for more than half of his life. His grandfather was also unable to learn how to read, only to witness his grandson's career rise from those humble beginnings in South Carolina to become both a member of Congress and a U.S. senator.",
      "\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said at the Republican National Convention in 2020.",
      "After serving in the House of Representatives from 2011 until 2013, Scott was appointed by then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to the Senate in 2012 after former Senator Jim DeMint left to become president of the Heritage Foundation. Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who was elected in a special election did not join the Senate until months after Scott's appointment.",
      "In 2024, the Senate will see its highest-ever Black senators serving concurrently. This group includes Sens. Raphael Warnock, Booker, Scott, Angela Alsobrooks, and Lisa Blunt Rochester. Rochester and Alsobrooks will also break barriers as the first two women to serve together in the Senate concurrently.",
      "During his early days in the Senate, Scott occasionally would serve as the only Black person in the Senate. In 2016, following the controversial deaths of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile he delivered a poignant speech about the deep divide between law enforcement and communities in America. He revealed that, as an elected official, he had been stopped and questioned seven times while driving. Even as a senator, Scott was questioned about his identity by Capitol Police despite wearing a pin identifying himenator.",
      "\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself,\" Scott said in 2016.",
      "As his career extends into the 119th Congress, Scott will make history as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee. He will lead the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and will also chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the only Black Republican to hold such a position.",
      "Marking the milestone achievement, Scott said in a statement, \"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream.\"",
      "\"We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again,\" he added.",

      "Some transgender people worry President Joe Biden did not do enough to shield them from the torrent of Trump policies to come",
      "President Joe Biden began his term in the White House with a broad promise to protect transgender Americans against Republican policies that painted them as a threat to children and sought to push them out of public life.",
      "\u201cYour president has your back,\u201d Biden assured trans people in his first State of the Union address in 2021, and he repeated a version of that statement in subsequent speeches.",
      "But with President-elect Donald Trump days away from taking office after piling on transgender people throughout his campaign, some worry Biden did not do enough to shield them from what's likely to come.",
      "The president-elect has declared that \u201cit will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders \u2014 male and female,\" and pledged to sign a series of executive orders targeting trans people early in his presidency.",
      "Biden and Democrats, meanwhile, are grappling with how to handle transgender politics after the GOP used Democrats' support for the trans community to win back the White House and control of Congress. Vice President Kamala Harris rarely mentioned transgender people during her campaign, but Trump's campaign cited previous Harris statements to argue relentlessly to swing voters that she was focused on trans issues rather than the economy.",
      "Democrats will not soon forget the punchline of a Trump ad that became ubiquitous by Election Day: \u201cKamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "In his last full month in office, Biden scrapped pending plans to provide protections for transgender student-athletes and signed a bill that includes language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for the children of service members.",
      "His actions follow a common strategy in which the outgoing administration rushes through policies or abandons unfinished regulations to prevent the incoming president from retooling them to more quickly advance his own agenda. But some trans people question why Biden let plans that might have better protected them from Trump's policies sit on the back-burner.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, the Biden administration has lived up to promises to support trans people, but not nearly to the degree that they could have, nor to what is equal to the current anti-trans onslaught,\" Imara Jones, a transgender woman who created \u201cThe Anti-Trans Hate Machine\u201d podcast, told The Associated Press.",
      "Biden named trans people to influential positions across his administration, she noted. He overturned a Trump-era ban on trans people serving in the military and made it possible for U.S. citizens who do not identify as male or female to select an \u201cX\u201d as the gender marker on their passports.",
      "\u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we have remedied historical injustices and advanced equality for the community, but there is more work to do, and we hope that work continues after he leaves office,\" said White House spokesperson Kelly Scully.",
      "The Justice Department under Biden also challenged state laws in Tennessee and Alabama that banned gender-affirming medical care for trans youth, and it filed statements of interest in other cases.",
      "\u201cBut major gaps were both opened and remain,\" Jones said. \"The administration failed to follow through on Title IX, failed to defend trans health care and failed to adequately address anti-trans violence. The list goes on. Even now, the administration could be putting in place measures to help safeguard the trans community, at least temporarily.\u201d",
      "Some LGBTQ+ advocates have accused Biden of abandoning the transgender community after he signed into law the annual defense bill despite his objections to a provision preventing the military\u2019s health program from covering certain medical treatments for transgender children in military families.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest organization of LGBTQ+ service members and veterans said Biden\u2019s decision to sign the bill is \"in direct opposition to claims that his administration is the most pro-LGBTQ+ in American history.\u201d",
      "Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said it's the first federal law targeting LGBTQ+ people since the 1990s, when Congress adopted the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, signed it into law, a decision he later said he regretted.",
      "The restriction comes as at least 26 states have adopted laws banning or limiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, though most face lawsuits. Federal judges have struck down the bans in Arkansas and Florida as unconstitutional, but a federal appeals court has stayed the Florida ruling. A judge\u2019s order is in place temporarily blocking enforcement of a ban in Montana.",
      "Twenty-five states have laws on the books barring trans women and girls from competing in certain women\u2019s sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked the enforcement of bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah.",
      "When Biden in 2023 introduced his now-abandoned proposal to forbid outright bans on transgender student-athletes, trans rights advocates were dissatisfied, saying it left room for individual schools to prevent some athletes from playing on teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "The sports proposal, meant as a follow-up to a broader rule that extended civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ students under Title IX, was then delayed several times.",
      "The delays from Biden were widely viewed as a political maneuver during an election year as Republicans generated outcry about trans athletes in girls' sports. Had the rule been finalized, it would likely have faced conservative legal challenges like those that prevented the broader Title IX policy from taking effect in dozens of states.",

    "story": [
      "Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay has died at age 91",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91.",
      "The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt was a very peaceful end to a great life,\u201d MacKay said.",
      "Buddy MacKay, Chiles' lieutenant governor for two terms, had been trounced by Bush in the 1998 gubernatorial election when Chiles died six weeks later on Dec. 12, 1998, at the governor's mansion. That put MacKay in the top job for three weeks, where he focused on overseeing the final stages of the transition to Bush's administration.",
      "\u201cIt was overwhelmingly sad,\u201d MacKay recalled in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press. \"(Chiles had) gotten that far through his term and it all just stopped. For me, there was nothing but to be a caretaker and try to help with the transition. The main thing we could do was stay out of the way.\u201d",
      "The MacKays never moved into the mansion.",
      "\"He was very, very sensitive to the fact he was there as the final caretaker,\" the late Democratic political strategist and MacKay adviser Jim Krog once said. \"He was clearly conscious of the fact that he was governor and there were some loose ends that needed to be tied up.\"",
      "MacKay was out of politics in 1990 when he persuaded Chiles, who had retired from the U.S. Senate two years earlier, to run for governor against incumbent Republican Bob Martinez. The Chiles-MacKay team was elected that November and again in 1994.",
      "MacKay, who also served in the Florida Legislature and U.S. House of Representatives, ran statewide three times and lost each time, but never lost his quiet sense of humor.",
      "\u201cI got out of politics because of illness,\u201d he said the day after being defeated by Bush. \u201cThe voters got sick and tired of me.\u201d",
      "An inveterate policy wonk, MacKay finished his political career as a special envoy to Latin America for President Bill Clinton before retiring to his central Florida home near Ocala. MacKay stood by the former president when many Democrats distanced themselves from Clinton in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He kept busy in the final years of his life doing pro bono work for the Southern Legal Counsel and also serving in a mediation role in the juvenile court system.",
      "MacKay narrowly missed winning election to the U.S. Senate race in 1988 when he lost to Republican Connie Mack III by less than 1 percentage point. It was the closest statewide race in the state's history until the 2000 presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore.",
      "In a Democratic primary field that at one time included former governors Claude Kirk \u2014 a one-time Republican \u2014 and Reubin Askew, who withdrew before the election, MacKay rebounded from a runner-up finish in a six-way primary to win a runoff against then-Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter.",
      "With Democrats still largely in control of Florida politics, MacKay was expected to sweep past Mack and hold Chiles' seat.",
      "But Mack, who had also been in the U.S. House, came up with a \"Hey Buddy, you're a liberal,\" catchphrase that MacKay couldn't shake at a time moderate Florida was moving away from traditional Democratic politics.",
      "It took two days after the 1988 election before the official vote count showed Mack had won, by fewer than 34,000 votes out of more than 4 million cast.",
      "Like many of Florida's leading Democratic politicians of the second half of the 20th century, MacKay began his political career at the height of the state's integration movement.",
      "MacKay had grown up working in the fields with Black laborers but went to segregated schools and ate in segregated restaurants.",
      "\"It was fairly wrenching,\" he said. \"It was always very awkward. My family was involved with agriculture and I worked many days in the field with African American crews and some of those adults were part of our family and raised me.\"",
      "MacKay's views on race and the potential for desegregation changed dramatically during his time in the U.S. Air Force between 1955 and 1958.",
      "\"Not until I went into the military did I see the potential for getting this behind us,\" MacKay said. \"I walked in there and from the first day it was totally integrated and there wasn't a problem. It was a very freeing experience.\"",
      "Kenneth H. MacKay Jr. was born March 22, 1933, in Ocala.",
      "\u201cIn the old South, which I was born into, 'Buddy' means junior,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cJudges and school teachers called me Kenneth, but nobody else did. I'm more of a Buddy than a Kenneth.\u201d",
      "He became an attorney and citrus grower after leaving the service. He won election to the state House in 1968, the state Senate in 1974 and to the U.S. House in 1982 before losing his U.S. Senate bid.",

      "Preliminary year-end statistics show that homicides in Detroit have dropped to levels not seen since before the mid-1960s",
      "DETROIT -- Homicides in Detroit have dropped to levels not seen since before the mid-1960s, according to preliminary year-end statistics released Friday by the city.",
      "The city is part of a national trend of declining rates of overall violent crime across the U.S.",
      "Detroit ended 2024 with about 203 homicides \u2014 down 49 from the year before and the fewest in the city since 188 were committed in 1965, Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters.",
      "Nonfatal shootings, assaults, carjackings and other violent crime also continue to drop across the city.",
      "\u201cWe have numbers that are nothing short of remarkable,\" Duggan said. \"I was the (Wayne County) prosecutor in 2002 and I remember the Detroit police celebrating that we got under 400 homicides for the first time and they said, \u2018We never thought we\u2019d see that number.' And a few years back I was the mayor and we got under 300 homicides.\u201d",
      "Overall violent crime in the United States declined by an estimated 3% in 2023 from the year before, according to an FBI report released in September. Nationally, murders and non-negligent manslaughter dropped nearly 12%.",
      "Detroit, which has a population of about 633,000 residents, reported 309 homicides in 2022. There also were 308 homicides in 2021. The city had 261 homicides in 2018, the fewest since 1966 when there were 214 homicides.",
      "Nonfatal shootings in Detroit dropped from 804 in 2023 to 606 last year.",
      "\u201cThe change in this community in just a few years has been very special,\u201d Duggan said of the fewer homicides and shootings. \u201cThese aren\u2019t numbers. These are real people, mostly young people in our community.\"",
      "Decreases have been across the board. Carjackings dipped from 167 in 2023 to 142 last year. Sexual assaults also were down and 184 fewer robberies were reported last year compared to 2023. Burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle theft also dropped.",
      "Duggan credited the city's partnerships with other local and state law enforcement and federal agencies.",
      "He also credited programs like ShotStoppers which provides federal funds to groups in Detroit working to cut down the numbers of homicides and shootings. Reductions of 83%, 73% and 61% in some of the city\u2019s most violent areas were reported last month.",
      "ShotStoppers kicked off in 2023 and empowers activists and residents to use their own strategies to prevent violence. Those strategies include teaching young people to think critically, improving training opportunities for adults, drug prevention and blight removal.",
      "Detroit also has been hiring more police officers, putting 340 more on city streets over the past two years."

      "The state is working through a backlog of inmates out of appeals but temporarily spared because prison officials couldn't obtain drugs needed for lethal injection.",
      "Marion Bowman Jr., 44, was convicted of murder in the shooting of a friend whose burned body was found in the trunk of her car in Dorchester County in 2001.",
      "Bowman's legal team said Friday that he maintains his innocence, while arguing that executing him would be \"unconscionable\" because of unresolved doubts about his conviction.",
      "Bowman would be the third inmate executed by lethal injection since September after the state obtained the drug it needed to carry out the death sentence. Inmates can also choose electrocution or a new firing squad. Three more inmates are awaiting execution dates that the state Supreme Court has decided can be set five weeks apart.",
      "The court could have set a date as early as Dec. 6 for Bowman's death, but the justices accepted without comment a request from lawyers for the four inmates awaiting execution that the state pause the deaths until January.",
      "\u201cSix consecutive executions with virtually no respite will take a substantial toll on all involved, particularly during a time of year that is so important to families,\u201d the lawyers wrote in court papers.",
      "Attorneys for the state had responded that prison officials were ready to keep to the original schedule and the state has conducted executions around the Christmas and New Year's holidays before, including five between Dec. 4, 1998, and Jan. 8, 1999.",
      "South Carolina was among the busiest states for executions back then, but that stopped once the state had trouble obtaining lethal injection drugs because of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 concerns they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to officials.",
      "The state Legislature has since passed a law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers secret, and in July, the state Supreme Court cleared the way to restart executions.",
      "Freddie Owens was put to death by lethal injection Sept. 20 and Richard Moore was executed on Nov. 1,",
      "Condemned inmates can also ask South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster for clemency, but no governor in the state has ever taken mercy and reduced a death sentence to life in prison without parole in the modern era of the death penalty.",

      "A Utah inmate in 2010 was the last person to have been executed by a firing squad in the U.S., according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Bowman, has spent more than half his life on death row. He was convicted of killing 21-year-old Kandee Martin in 2001. A number of friends and family members testified against him as part of plea deals.",
      "One friend said Bowman was angry because Martin owed him money. A second testified Bowman thought Martin was wearing a recording device to get him arrested on a charge.",
      "A federal judge earlier this year threw out a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union asking to be able to air a podcast from Bowman as part of his clemency request. The organization has appealed the decision.",
      "South Carolina's prison system bans on-camera, in-person interviews with inmates or recording their phone calls or words for broadcast.",
      "Bowman\u2019s lawyers asked the South Carolina Supreme Court to postpone his execution so a hearing can be held on his last-ditch appeal saying his trial lawyer was inadequately prepared and had too much sympathy for the white victim and not Bowman, who is Black.",
      "Bowman's legal team said Friday that he did not receive a fair trial and lacked effective legal representation.",
      "Bowman's attorney pressured him to plead guilty and \u201cmade other poor decisions based on his racist views rather than strategic legal counsel,\u201d said Lindsey S. Vann, executive director of the inmate-advocacy group Justice 360.",

      "\u201cHis conviction was based on unreliable, incentivized testimony from biased witnesses who received reduced or dropped sentences in exchange for their cooperation,\u201d Vann said.",
      "South Carolina has put 45 inmates to death since the death penalty was restarted in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, it was carrying out an average of three executions a year. Nine states have put more inmates to death.",
      "But since the unintentional execution pause, South Carolina\u2019s death row population has dwindled. The state had 63 condemned inmates in early 2011. It currently has 30. About 20 inmates have been taken off death row and received different prison sentences after successful appeals. Others have died of natural causes."

      "Dennoriss Richardson\u2019s body was discovered in September in rural Colbert County, far from his home in Sheffield, Alabama, a small town of nearly 10,000 nestled along the Tennessee River.",
      "A state autopsy released to law enforcement in late December ruled the 39-year-old\u2019s death a suicide, Colbert County Sheriff Eric Balentine told AL.com.",
      "Despite the state\u2019s official findings, the case has sparked intense suspicion and outcry in a community with a long history of racial injustice and a deep-seated distrust of local law enforcement.",

      "\u201cThey get those preliminary results back pretty quick, we had those within the week\" of Richardson's death, Balentine said to AL.com. \u201cIt\u2019s taken three months to get the official (report) back.\u201d",

      "But the report noted that the hyoid neck bone, which is sometimes fractured in deaths from hanging and strangulation, wasn't present when Shaker examined the body. Shaker's report said this made it impossible for him to determine whether Richardson was killed or committed suicide.",
      "The hyoid bone does not always offer conclusive evidence about the manner of death, according to forensic pathologist Dr. Thomas Andrew, who has worked in the field for over 40 years.",
      "\u201cYou cannot opine on manner of death based on the hyoid bone alone,\u201d Andrew said. The hyoid bone breaks in approximately a quarter of all hangings and half of all strangulations, Andrew added. Instead, \u201cthe manner of death determination is based largely on evidentiary and circumstantial information.\u201d",
      "Andrew said that it was his standard practice to remove the hyoid bone in cases like Richardson\u2019s, and that he would only give it to private pathologists performing secondary autopsies upon request.",
      "Richardson did not have any bodily injuries except for on his neck, and his toxicology report was normal, Shaker said. Andrew said those were \u201cimportant observations.\u201d",
      "In the report, Shaker said that it was impossible to conclude how Richardson died without photographs of where his body was found or the rope that killed him. Neither were provided with the body, according to Shaker.",

      "ATLANTA -- The U.S. Justice Department announced Friday that it has entered into a court-enforceable agreement with Georgia's most populous county after finding that violence and filthy conditions in county lockups violated the constitutional rights of people held in jail.",
      "The Justice Department has filed a complaint and proposed consent decree in federal court, and the agreement must still be approved by a judge, the agency said in a news release. But if the plans outlined in the agreement are successfully implemented, they would resolve problems found by department investigators, the release says.",
      "In July 2023, the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into jail conditions in Fulton County, citing violence, filthy living quarters and the in-custody death of a man whose body was found covered in insects. That investigation found that jail officials failed to protect detainees from violence, used excessive force and held them in \u201cunconstitutional and illegal conditions.\u201d",
      "The Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release that it had anticipated the Justice Department\u2019s filing and has been working with the department and the county attorney\u2019s office. The agreement to enter into a consent decree came after \u201cextensive negotiations,\u201d the release says.",
      "\u201cThis consent order is a road map to a better future for our facility, staff, and the individuals entrusted to our care,\u201d Sheriff Pat Labat said. \u201cTogether, these opportunities will build meaningful and long-lasting change.\u201d",
      "Under the proposed agreement with the county and sheriff, officials will develop plans and policies to keep detainees safe from violence, improve supervision and staffing, ensure doors and locks work and require staff to adhere to constitutional standards when using force. They will also take steps to protect detainees who are at risk of suicide and to give detainees adequate medical and mental health care. And they will develop a housekeeping and pest control plan to keep the jail clean and sanitary.",
      "The jail will also stop using isolation for vulnerable people at risk of self harm and will facilitate the provision of adequate special education services to children with disabilities held in the jail, the consent decree says.",
      "The proposed consent decree provides for an independent monitor to assess the jail\u2019s implementation of its requirements and to provide a public report every six months.",
      "The county's main jail has long been plagued by problems, and Labat, who was reelected in November, has been calling for the construction of an expensive new jail since taking office in January 2021. A lengthy report released in November that details the Justice Department findings said that although Labat and other county leaders were aware of the problems and have spoken publicly spoken about them, \u201cthey have failed to take adequate action to address the crisis.\u201d",
      "When the Justice Department announced its findings in November, Labat and county Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts said they had already been working to address structural and programming concerns at the jail.",
      "The report detailed a \u201ccrisis of violence,\" including stabbings, sexual assaults and killings. It also said vulnerable populations, including people who are gay, transgender, young or who have serious mental illness, were particularly at risk from the violence, which causes physical injury and long-lasting trauma.",
      "Jail officers do not receive adequate training and guidance on the use of of force and were found to engage in \"a pattern or practice of using excessive force\u201d against people in county custody, the report said.",
      "Fulton County has a main jail and three annexes, and investigators found that the main jail is hazardous and unsanitary, citing flooding from broken toilets and sinks, infestations of cockroaches and rodents, and filthy cells with dangerous exposed wires. There isn\u2019t enough food for detainees and the distribution services are unsanitary, exposing detainees to pest infestation, malnourishment and other harms, the report said.",
      "People held in Fulton County custody receive inadequate medical and mental health care in violation of their constitutional rights, leaving them open to risk of injury, serious illness, pain and suffering, mental health decline and death, investigators found.",
      "When the Justice Department launched its investigation, officials cited the September 2022 death of 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson in a bedbug-infested cell in the main jail\u2019s psychiatric wing, noting that an independent autopsy conducted at his family\u2019s request found that he died of severe neglect. Photos released by attorneys for Thompson\u2019s family showed that his body was covered in insects and that his cell was filthy and full of garbage.",
      "Included in the report were 11 pages of \u201cminimum remedial measures\u201d that jail officials were advised to implement. It ended with a warning that federal authorities could take legal action if concerns are not sufficiently addressed.",
      "A Georgia state Senate committee formed last year to examine jail conditions in Fulton County concluded in August that county officials needed to do more to work together to address problems at the jail. It also called on the city of Atlanta to hand over all of its former jail to the county to house prisoners."

      "Rudy Giuliani is in a New York courtroom facing a contempt hearing over whether he has dodged and deceived lawyers trying to recover a $148 million judgment for two Georgia election workers",
      "NEW YORK -- Rudy Giuliani showed up Friday for a contempt hearing to decide whether he has dodged and deceived lawyers trying to recover a $148 million judgment won on behalf of two Georgia election workers.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman has said he may rule at the hearing whether the former New York City mayor faces civil sanctions over his failure to turn over some assets.",
      "Giuliani requested a day earlier to appear remotely at the hearing, but he changed his mind and came to court after the judge indicated that making a remote appearance would limit his options at the proceeding.",
      "The lawyers claim Giuliani has displayed a \u201cconsistent pattern of willful defiance\u201d of Liman\u2019s October order to give up assets, after he was found liable in 2023 for defaming the poll workers by falsely accusing them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election.",
      "They said in court papers earlier this week that he has turned over a Mercedes-Benz and his New York apartment, but not the paperwork necessary to monetize the assets. And they said he has failed to surrender valuable watches and sports memorabilia, including a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt, and not \u201ca single dollar from his nonexempt cash accounts.\u201d",
      "Liman said in an order last week that Giuliani's lawyer should be ready to explain why Giuliani should not be held in contempt with resulting sanctions that could make it less likely that he gets to keep his Florida residence. A trial over the disposition of the Palm Beach condominium and World Series rings is scheduled for mid-January.",
      "Giuliani has maintained that the Palm Beach property is his personal residence now and should be shielded from the judgment.",
      "Giuliani\u2019s lawyers have predicted that Giuliani will eventually win custody of the items on appeal.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities and residents in Hawaii are wondering whether a New Year's Eve explosion that killed three people and wounded more than 20 will dampen the state's enthusiasm for illegal pyrotechnic displays",
      "HONOLULU -- In recent years, occasions large and small \u2014 parties, Super Bowls, mixed-martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving \u2014 have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks.",
      "The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter\u2019s home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor.",
      "Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths.",
      "But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu.",
      "Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down.",
      "\u201cThis incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. \u201cThey put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis.",
      "The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Gov. Josh Green.",
      "And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations.",
      "Rep. Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it\u2019s a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today.",
      "\u201cThe kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the danger is magnified.\u201d",
      "Charmaine Doran, the vice-chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: \u201cThey have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I\u2019m pretty old.\u201d",
      "In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year\u2019s. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day.",
      "Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where \u201cwe\u2019re related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,\u201d Doran said.",
      "People fear retribution, she added: \u201cIf I dial 911, they\u2019re going to egg my house.\u201d",
      "That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threated by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve until after midnight.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,\u201d Takushi said. \u201cHe has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.\u201d",
      "Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities.",
      "Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear.",
      "\u201cA string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,\" Takushi said.",
      "Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu\u2019s hotspots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives.",
      "He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if \u201cthey can\u2019t catch people in the act.\u201d",
      "Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles.",
      "\u201cWe already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,\u201d he said. \"I mean we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.\u201d",
      "The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii\u2019s ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they\u2019re in the community, it\u2019s very difficult to track them down,\u201d Takayama said.",

      "Fourteen people were killed in the attack along Bourbon Street that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State militant group. The driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and slamming into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.",

      "The FBI continued to hunt for clues about Jabbar but, a day into its investigation, the agency said it was confident he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.",
      "The FBI said that hours before the attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in which he proclaimed his support for the Islamic State group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district.",
      "It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. It also comes as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval, and likely policy changes, after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration takes office.",
      "Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism division, stressed there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck packed with fireworks outside Trump\u2019s Las Vegas hotel.",
      "The New Orleans attack plans also included the placement of crude bombs in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage, officials said. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional.",
      "Investigators also were trying to understand more about Jabbar's path to radicalization, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night.",
      "The FBI recovered a black IS flag from Jabbar's rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends but was concerned news headlines would not focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d Raia said.",
      "Jabbar also stated he joined IS before last summer and provided a last will and testament, the FBI said.",
      "Jabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.",
      "A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly, said Jabbar traveled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the U.S. and then traveling to Toronto for three days. It was not immediately clear what he did during those travels.",
      "Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar's younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel real\u201d that his brother could have done this.",

      "Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips.",

      "Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock. The first 10 wolves were released a year ago, and since then there have been over two dozen claims of depredations \u2014 when wolves kill livestock or working dogs.",

      "\u201cI wish I knew what that meant, but it doesn\u2019t sound good,\" the governor said.",
      "He called his son, Will, to translate, asking him: \u201cSo is that like a good thing?\u201d His son replied it wasn't, saying it meant \"you have zero coolness.\u201d",
      "Laughing it off, the governor got in the last word, saying he has \u201cso much aura.\u201d",
      "When another post commented on Beshear's physical appearance, saying he has \u201cno abs,\u201d his wife replied that they had invested in a rowing machine, so \u201dlook out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you for letting the world know about the rowing machine,\u201d the governor replied.",
      "He also read two competing posts, one that said: \u201cAndy Beshear sounded like a goober\u201d and the other that said Beshear is \"the goober that America needs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got you, America,\u201d the governor said.",
      "Beshear ended the video on a more serious note, saying Kentucky had \u201canother great year\u201d and urging viewers to \u201chug on the people that you love.\u201d Since he became governor in late 2019, Kentucky has achieved its first-, second- and fourth-best years ever for private-sector investments.",
      "Beshear is one of several Democratic governors who are the subject of early speculation as potential contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2028. Beshear's second term as governor ends in late 2027 and term limits mean he can't run for reelection then.",
      "He recently said his focus will remain on jobs, infrastructure, education and health care in 2025. Beshear mentioned those same issues during a recent sit-down interview with The Associated Press when he gave suggestions on what Democrats should look for in their next presidential nominee on everything from more affordable health care to pro-public education and greater public safety in communities.",
      "\u201cI think the next Democratic nominee should be a pragmatist that is about getting things done, getting real results,\u201d he said."

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York's attorney general appointed a veteran district attorney Thursday as a special prosecutor in the death of a man who was beaten by state corrections officers, saying she needed to recuse her office to avoid potential conflicts.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, whose office had been investigating events preceding last month's death of Robert Brooks, said the special prosecutor will be Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, who has been the top prosecutor in the Syracuse area since 1992.",
      "The attorney general typically investigates the deaths of people in the custody of law enforcement, but James said four of the officers under investigation were being represented by lawyers in her office in other litigation and that could create problems.",
      "\u201cEven the possibility or mere appearance of a conflict could tie up a potential prosecution in lengthy legal challenges or get a potential prosecution outright dismissed,\u201d James said in a video message. \u201cAnd I will not allow justice to be delayed or denied because of a conflict.\u201d",
      "A call seeking comment was made to Fitzpatrick\u2019s office.",

      "Brooks was pronounced dead the following morning.",
      "The beating has prompted widespread condemnation and calls for reform. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said she was \u201coutraged and horrified\u201d by the videos, appointed a new superintendent and said 13 correctional officers and a nurse implicated in the attack will face termination.",
      "Now that a special prosecutor has been appointed, Hochul said, she expects his team will work quickly to bring charges.",
      "\u201cThe video of this horrific attack demonstrates that crimes clearly were committed, and I believe initial charges can be brought even as more serious charges are considered based on further investigation,\u201d Hochul said.",
      "The final results of Brooks\u2019 autopsy are not available. Preliminary findings from a medical examination indicate \u201cconcern for asphyxia due to compression of the neck as the cause of death, as well as the death being due to actions of another,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "Brooks, who was serving a 12-year prison sentence for first-degree assault since 2017, arrived at the prison 200 miles (320 kilometers) northwest of New York City only hours before the beating after being transferred from another nearby facility, officials said.",

      "An endangered Pacific Northwest orca that made global headlines in 2018 for carrying her dead calf for over two weeks is doing so once again following the death of her new calf, in another sign of grief over lost offspring, researchers said.",
      "The mother orca, known as Tahlequah or J35, has been seen carrying the body of the deceased female calf since Wednesday, the Washington state-based Center for Whale Research said in a Facebook post.",
      "\u201cThe entire team at the Center for Whale Research is deeply saddened by this news and we will continue to provide updates when we can,\u201d the post said.",
      "In 2018, researchers observed J35 pushing her dead calf along for 17 days, propping it up for more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers). The calf had died shortly after it was born, and the mother and her closely knit pod of whales were seen taking turns carrying the dead body.",
      "The research center said roughly two weeks ago that it had been made aware of the new calf. But on Christmas Eve, it said it was concerned about the calf's health based on its behavior and that of its mother. By New Years Day, the center was receiving reports that J35 was carrying her calf\u2019s dead body.",
      "Calf mortality is high: Only about 1 in 5 orca pregnancies result in a calf that lives to its first birthday.",
      "The center described the death of J35's calf as particularly devastating \u2014 not only because she could have eventually grown to give birth and bolster the struggling population, but because J35 has now lost two out of four documented calves.",
      "The population of southern resident killer whales \u2014 three pods of fish-eating orcas that frequent the waters between Washington state and British Columbia \u2014 has struggled for decades, with 73 orcas remaining. They must contend with a dearth of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon, as well as pollution and vessel noise, which hinders their hunting. Researchers have warned they are on the brink of extinction.",
      "Southern resident orcas are endangered, and distinct from other killer whales because they eat salmon rather than marine mammals. Individual whales are identified by unique markings or variations in their fin shapes, and each whale is given a number and name.",
      "Traveling together in matrilineal groups, the orcas at times can be seen breaching around Puget Sound, even against the backdrop of the downtown Seattle skyline."

    "story": [
      "California is beginning 2025 with a solid start to the winter snowpack, but more storms are needed to keep the state\u2019s water supplies on track",
      "PHILLIPS STATION, Calif. -- California is beginning 2025 with a solid start to the winter snowpack, officials said Thursday, but they cautioned that more storms are needed to keep the state's water supplies on track.",
      "Officials at Phillips Station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state, recorded a snow depth of 24 inches (61 centimeters), said Andy Reising, manager of the Department of Water Resources' snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit.",
      "The water content of the snowpack at the station was 91% of the average to date and 37% of the average on April 1, when the Sierra snowpack is typically at its peak, he said.",
      "\u201cAs of right now, I am feeling OK, but ... we'll need a progression of monthly storms to keep going,\u201d Reising said, adding that the northern half of the state has seen a series of storms but the south has been dry.",
      "The snowpack functions as a huge frozen reservoir, providing nearly a third of the water used annually in California as it melts and runs off into streams and rivers in the spring. The state has built a complex system of canals and dams to capture that water and store it in huge reservoirs so it can be used the rest of the year when it doesn\u2019t rain or snow.",
      "The measurements are closely watched in California, which is the nation\u2019s most populous state with 39 million people, and also responsible for growing more than a third of the country\u2019s vegetables and three-quarters of its fruit and nuts. The health of the snowpack helps determine whether California will have a difficult time providing water throughout the summer to farms and cities.",
      "Many of California\u2019s state-run reservoirs are at two-thirds or three-quarters of their capacity, and well above the historical average for the start of the year, thanks to two years of above-average snowpack conditions, state data shows. Last week, California officials told farms and cities that rely on state water supplies that they would get more water than previously planned because of strong storms at the end of 2024. They can now expect to get 15% of their requested supplies instead of 5%, and that number could go up if the wet weather continues.",
      "The survey was the first in a seasonal series of manual measurements at Phillips Station. The department also collects measurements with electronic instruments at other sites, and said that statewide the snowpack is 108% of average.",
      "A year ago, the state began the season with below-normal mountain snowpack and a water content of about 25% of the average. By April, the water content measured 110% of the average. That followed a massive snowpack to start 2023, after a series of atmospheric rivers helped pull the state out of a three-year drought.",

      "Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated value of more than $480.

      "Wisconsin election officials are launching an investigation into how nearly 200 absentee ballots went uncounted in Madison",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Nearly 200 absentee ballots somehow went uncounted in Wisconsin's liberal capital after the Nov. 5 election, prompting state election officials to launch an investigation Thursday into whether the city clerk broke the law.",
      "The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously to investigate whether Madison City Clerk Maribeth Wetzel-Biehl failed to comply with state law or abused her discretion. Commission members said they were concerned the clerk's office didn't inform them of the problem until late December, almost a month and a half after the election. Commission Chair Ann Jacobs certified Wisconsin's election results on Nov. 29.",
      "Wetzel-Biehl's office said in a statement that the number of uncounted votes didn't affect the outcome of any race or referendum on the ballots. But Jacobs said the oversight was \u201cso egregious\u201d that the commission must determine what happened and how it can be prevented as spring elections approach.",
      "\u201cWe are the final canvassers,\" Jacobs said. \u201cWe are the final arbiters of votes in the state of Wisconsin and we need to know why those ballots weren't included anywhere.\u201d",
      "Wetzel-Biehl said in an email to The Associated Press that her office looks forward to working with the commission to determine what happened and how to prevent the same issues in future elections.",
      "It\u2019s another misstep for Wetzel-Biehl, who announced in September that her office mistakenly sent out up to 2,000 duplicate absentee ballots. She blamed it on a data processing error.",
      "According to election commission documents, the commission learned of the uncounted ballots on Dec. 18, when Wetzel-Biehl's staff told the commission that they recorded more absentee ballots as received than ballots counted in three city wards.",
      "The commission asked Wetzel-Biehl to provide a detailed statement, which she did two days later. The memo stated that on Nov. 12, the clerk\u2019s office discovered 67 unprocessed ballots for Ward 65 and one unprocessed ballot for Ward 68 in a courier bag found in a vote tabulating machine.",
      "The memo also stated that her office was reconciling ballots for Ward 56 on Dec. 3 when 125 unprocessed ballots were discovered in a sealed courier bag. Reconciliation is a post-election process in which officials account for every ballot created. That work begins immediately after an election. Clerks have 45 days to complete it.",
      "The memo does not offer any explanation, saying only that the clerk's office planned \u201cto debrief these incidents and implement better processes.\u201d",
      "The clerk's office issued a statement on Dec. 26 saying it had informed the elections commission and would send an apology letter to each affected voter.",
      "Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway released her own statement the same day saying the clerk's office didn't tell her staff about the problem until Dec. 20. She said her office plans to review the city's election procedures.",
      "\u201cWhile the discovery of these unprocessed absentee ballots did not impact the results of any election or referendum, a discrepancy of this magnitude is unacceptable,\u201d the mayor said in the statement.",
      "Wisconsin is a perennial battleground state in presidential elections. Republican Donald Trump won the state this past November on his way to reclaiming the White House, beating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris by about 29,000 votes.",
      "Madison and surrounding Dane County are well-known liberal strongholds. Harris won 75% of the vote in the county in November."

    "title": "West Virginia patients left in limbo over changing insurance coverage of obesity meds",
    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 13:35:08 -0500",
    "summary": "While West Virginia's employee health insurance program covers drugs like Ozempic for people with type 2 diabetes, officials decided to indefinitely pause covering their use for weight loss patients because of the cost",
    "story": [
      "While West Virginia's employee health insurance program covers drugs like Ozempic for people with type 2 diabetes, officials decided to indefinitely pause covering their use for weight loss patients because of the cost",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Lory Osborn says the Wegovy she was prescribed 15 months ago did more than help her lose 75 pounds \u2014 over a quarter of her body weight. The administrative assistant at West Virginia University said she feels healthier at 62 than she has since graduating high school.",
      "But lately, she's been having panic attacks because she fears running out of medication. Citing a gross cost of $1.4 million a month, West Virginia abruptly announced in March it would indefinitely pause a pilot program covering weight loss drugs for 1,000 public employees, leaving patients like her scrambling. West Virginia\u2019s Public Employee Insurance Agency (PEIA) will continue covering the popular and expensive GLP-1 drugs to treat Type 2 diabetes.",
      "Other state and private insurers have adopted similar stances for the drugs, which can cost patients more than $1,000 monthly out-of-pocket. In 2024, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state\u2019s largest nonprofit insurer, and North Carolina's state employee public insurance agency stopped covering the drugs for weight loss, saying the cost increased premiums for all customers.",
      "The dilemma comes amid a similar debate at the federal level. President Joe Biden unveiled a plan in November to cover the drugs for millions of weight loss patients on Medicaid and Medicare, though the measure could face opposition from President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, has criticized Ozempic \u2014 a GLP-1 used to treat diabetes.",
      "Proponents say long-term savings could outweigh the cost \u2014 especially in West Virginia, which has the nation's highest rates of obesity and diabetes. Obesity increases their risk for conditions such as heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. About half of West Virginians rely on Medicare or Medicaid for insurance.",
      "Osborn said it makes no sense for West Virginia to invest the money in the pilot only for patients to come off it and lose their progress. Osborn usually takes her injections once weekly, but said she started waiting 10 or 12 days to make her final three-month supply last.",
      "\u201cIt is so cruel,\u201d said Osborn, who took her last PEIA-covered dose of Wegovy weeks ago. \u201cWe are suffering mentally just from the thought of going back.\u201d",
      "West Virginia\u2019s residents are among the poorest in the U.S. and the state is home to rural food deserts where it can be hard to find any grocery stores, never mind finding one with a variety of nutritional food options.",
      "Outgoing West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice \u2014 who has lost between 30 and 50 pounds while taking Ozempic \u2014 said after Biden's announcement that he would \u201cbe a proponent of trying to do everything we can to be able to expand these drugs to everybody.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s a real argument that at the end of the day, we end up saving that money,\" said Justice, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in November. About 25% of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight loss drugs, according to the AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus, a database produced by the Leverage consulting firm.",
      "The vast majority of coverage of the drugs is provided by government health plans, largely state Medicaid plans, according to Leverage. All state Medicaid programs cover the drugs for Type 2 diabetes, but only 14 provide some form of coverage to treat obesity. Medicare plans cover the drugs for weight loss if they are prescribed to a person at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Dr. Laura Davisson, medical weight management director at West Virginia University, said losing coverage for medications is a \u201cnightmare\u201d for patients. This year, Davisson\u2019s office saw over 1,000 GLP-1 patients \u2014 many of whom have made extra appointments or joined support groups with her staff to discuss options when they learned of the coverage changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the state with the number one rate of obesity, and I\u2019ve just lost all access to my most powerful tool for treating obesity medically with almost every one of my payers,\u201d she said. \u201cHow does that make sense?\u201d",
      "The length of time she sees patients take the drugs varies, but some may have to take it indefinitely to suppress food cravings. She said the state employee pilot program took a responsible approach by requiring that patients be prescribed the medications through obesity specialists, giving them counseling on diet, exercise and side effect management.",
      "\u201cThey already invested millions of dollars in these people,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s financially wasteful to throw it away, have these people regain their weight, get their health problems back, and we don\u2019t actually get to see the full potential of this pilot project.\"",
      "Dr. Bisher Mustafa of the Marshall Health Obesity Clinic in Huntington said there's a certain irony to waiting \"until people have diabetes to start the medication.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try to prevent diabetes from happening from the beginning,\u201d he said.",
      "PEIA Director Brian Cunningham said GLP-1s, which the state began offering for weight loss in 2019, cost the program around $53 million last fiscal year \u2014 about 20% of what PEIA spends on drugs.",
      "The cost of the GLP-1s was cited as a reason for 14% premium hikes for state employees, as well as a 16% increase for county employees and a 12% bump in costs for retirees. Increases will go into effect in July, according to the insurance agency, which covers 150,000 government workers, 56,000 retirees and their dependents.",
      "That's frustrated some PEIA members who feel they are unfairly shouldering the cost burden for a medication they don't use. Ashley Peggs, a Kanawha County teacher who doesn't use GLP-1 drugs, said her heart sank when she saw how much the plan was spending on the medicines during a public hearing about the proposed premium increases.",
      "She said the agency had just denied coverage for a spinal procedure for a condition threatening her ability to walk.",
      "\"So somebody else being skinny is more important than the fact that I literally may not be able to continue teaching until I retire without a wheelchair?\" said Peggs, 35, at the public hearing.",
      "Some taking the drugs for diabetes \u2014 like the vast majority of state employees on GLP-1s \u2014 expressed frustration that they haven't even been able to access Ozempic consistently because of shortages.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be cheaper: pay for that medication or for me to lose a leg to gangrene like my grandmother did?\u201d said Michael Kimball, 42, who takes the drug for diabetes. \u201cYear after year, the burden is put on the back of the working man and we\u2019re getting a little tired of it.\"",
      "Osborn described Wegovy as a breakthrough recommended by her provider after she'd tried for years to lose weight any way she could. She's also been able to halve the amount of rheumatoid arthritis medication she takes and she's seen back pain and her sciatica almost eradicated.",
      "She said dropping coverage for obesity patients feels like \u201cweight-based discrimination\u201d because other chronic diseases qualify. Osborn said she'll try purchasing versions of the medications that aren't approved by the FDA through compounding pharmacies. Doing so will increase her cost to around $300 per month. PEIA had provided her with a three-month supply for $50.",
      "\u201cI think that they need to realize that obesity is a disease \u2014 it's not a willpower, gutting-it-out choice,\" she said. \"It is a disease that you suffer from just like any other disease that you cannot prevent.\u201d"

    "summary": "Delays and cancellations related to British weather may become more common.",
    "story": [
      "Heavy winds and fog led to thousands of flights being delayed or cancelled at the end of 2024 - and wintry weather could bring further disruption this weekend.",
      "It can seem a mystery to many frustrated flyers that a brief spell of bad weather can upend schedules, especially since British weather isn't exactly famed for being the best.",
      "Many of us are used to facing train delays here in the UK - whether it's leaves on the line or just a typical commute - but with all the technological advancements of planes and airports in recent years, why flights?",
      "BBC News found out why there are many reasons poor weather can wreak havoc on passengers and crew alike.",
      "'Grim' delay ordeal",
      "Elif Arjin Celik was one of hundreds taken by surprise when her flight from London Gatwick to Istanbul was delayed by hours because of poor visibility in the fog on 28 December 2024.",
      "With scores of flights at the airport delayed, during what was its busiest Christmas since the Covid pandemic, she saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit.",
      "She says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes just to use the toilet because of queues from the \"extreme overcrowding\".",
      "\"Fridges were empty with not enough food for everyone and all the restaurants were struggling to seat people,\" she told the BBC.",
      "That fog-related disruption ended up lasting for three days, affecting tens of thousands of Christmas travellers at airports across the UK.",
      "So why exactly do so many flights get delayed in situations like this?",
      "How efficiency can quickly turn to chaos",
      "\"Aircraft can operate safely in fog, but airports go into a kind of slow motion,\" says travel expert Simon Calder.",
      "\"Aircraft follow a beam from the instrument landing system. This beam must not be broken, which could happen when it's foggy,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "And when there are high winds, for safety, aircraft have to be more spaced apart than usual.",
      "Despite Heathrow trialling artificial intelligence to help planes land in low visibility, controllers in on-ground towers still need to clearly see an aircraft arriving before issuing a landing clearance, aviation expert Scott Bateman MBE wrote on X.",
      "He says the majority of modern aircraft can automatically land in the worst fog, but that in practice visibility limits are imposed so pilots can see sufficiently to taxi off the runway.",
      "Mr Calder adds: \"If fog or high winds requires air-traffic controllers to increase the spacing between aircraft by 50%, capacity is immediately reduced by one third \u2013 and cancellations begin.\"",
      "When things are running smoothly, Gatwick's runway has a take-off or landing every 65 seconds. At Heathrow, schedules are based on landing aircraft as close as 80 seconds apart.",
      "With this little room for error, Mr Calder estimates about 75,000 passengers were affected by the Christmas fog delays and cancellations.",
      "And with upcoming warnings of snow, he advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights.",
      "\"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow.",
      "Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris.",
      "Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in the likes of Iceland and Greenland can.",
      "Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather.",
      "\"Historically the UK has had a benign climate. Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"",
      "Disruption could grow",
      "And there's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "She says that climate warming increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent.\" It also means more instances of aircraft turbulence.",
      "James and Madison King endured a lengthy diversion on their flight home to the UK from Stockholm at Christmas because of the fog.",
      "They were within touching distance of home when their pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at London Gatwick, so they flew to Dublin to refuel and then back to where they started in Stockholm.",
      "James says he still hasn't received reimbursement for the incurred expenses of \u00a3200 for a hotel and dinner during this impromptu additional overnight stay in Stockholm.",
      "At the centre of it all is Nats, the national air traffic service, which steps in to limit traffic in Britain's skies during bad weather - forcing airlines to tear up schedules.",
      "\"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" Nats told the BBC.",
      "During turbulence from storm clouds, passengers feel uncomfortable - and pilots will often want to leave their expected routes, ending up in unexpected parts of the sky and at different times, the organisation explained.",
      "\"Because of this, we have to coordinate with the pilots to establish a new route in relation to any other aircraft they might be sharing the airspace with, as well as ensuring that any original traffic is separated from any unexpected additions,\" Nats said.",
      "\"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.",
      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

      "When it comes to heating, there is much debate about whether it is more efficient to keep it permanently on low, rather than switch it on and off when needed.",
      "Experts don't have a clear answer on that, as it often depends on circumstances in the home, but it probably isn't the best option for most people.",
      "Generally, a room temperature between 18C and 21C is ideal for most, but turning it down one degree can save money.",
      "For older people, and those with health conditions, it is best not to let temperatures drop below 18C in rooms used regularly.",

      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",

      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 09:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "One leading lobby group said it would result in a \"costly start\" to 2025 for many bus passengers.",
    "story": [
      "Many bus passengers in England will face an increase in single fares from \u00a32 to \u00a33 from Wednesday.",
      "Leading campaign groups have said it would result in a \"costly start\" to 2025.",
      "The previous limit of \u00a32 was introduced under the Conservative government to help with the rising cost of living.",
      "The Department for Transport said, however, that the money raised will help support travel in rural communities and towns where there is a heavy reliance on buses.",
      "The new \u00a33 cap, covering most bus journeys in England, will run until the end of 2025.",
      "Fares that would be below \u00a33 without the cap - such as many in urban areas - are only permitted to rise in line with inflation, which measures how prices change over time.",
      "Buses are the most commonly-used form of public transport in Great Britain. But in recent years, thousands of services have been cut due to local councils' funding coming under significant pressure.",
      "Outside of London, bus mileage in the year ending March 2024 was about a quarter lower than in 2005.",
      "There was speculation that the bus fare cap in England would be scrapped entirely at Chancellor Rachel Reeves' first Autumn Budget.",
      "Silviya Barrett, from lobby group Campaign for Better Transport, said that the policy had proven popular with passengers.",
      "While the cap which was due to expire at the end of December was retained, she said that its increase to \u00a33 was \"significant\".",
      "\"The government must now look for a long-term replacement for the scheme from next year to avoid any further rises,\" she said.",
      "Man who used \u00a32 buses says price rise 'inevitable'",
      "Mayor disappointed by bus fare increase",
      "Several passengers told the BBC that they were concerned about the impact of the change on people on lower incomes.",
      "Local authorities do, however, have the power to keep the cap lower in their areas if they subsidise it themselves, or fund their own local transport schemes.",
      "For example, the cost of a single journey on a bus in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, and County Durham will be capped at \u00a32.50 from January.",
      "This comes after North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said it would be subsidised by the North East Combined Authority until December 2025.",
      "In West Yorkshire, the cap will remain \u00a32 until the end of March, after which it will rise to \u00a32.50 for the remainder of the year.",
      "Single bus fares in London with Transport for London will also remain at \u00a31.75 and those in Greater Manchester at \u00a32. These regions are excluded from the broader fare cap as their funding is structured differently.",
      "Alison Edwards, director of policy at bus and coach industry body the Confederation of Passenger Transport, suggested that many people who use bus services would continue to pay well under \u00a33 per journey.",
      "She said that commuters and regular passengers often opt for season tickets which are cheaper.",
      "Many single fares on shorter routes will remain below \u00a33, she added.",
      "The transport department said it is providing more than \u00a3150m in funding to help fund the cap this year.",
      "The Bus Services Bill currently passing through Parliament will also place a duty on officials to ensure that every town in England and Wales with a population of more than 10,000 people has a regular service operating seven days a week.",
      "Local transport minister Simon Lightwood said that buses are \"vital\" to help people get to work, see a doctor, or to visit their friends and family.",
      "He said that the government is ensuring that buses \"continue to be an attractive, affordable way to get around\"."

      "Russian gas has stopped flowing to EU states via Ukraine after a five-year deal expired, marking the end of a decades-long arrangement.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country would not allow Russia to \"earn additional billions on our blood\". Poland's government meanwhile said the cut-off was \"another victory\" against Moscow.",

      "While immediate effects are light, the strategic and symbolic impact for the whole of Europe is enormous.",
      "Russia has lost an important market, but its president, Vladimir Putin, says EU countries will suffer most.",
      "The EU has significantly reduced imports of gas from Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but a number of eastern member states still depend largely on the supplies, making Russia about \u20ac5bn ($5.2bn; \u00a34.2bn) a year.",
      "Russian gas was less than 10% of the EU's gas imports in 2023, according to the bloc. That figure was 40% in 2021.",
      "But several EU members, including Slovakia and Austria, continued to import significant amounts of gas from Russia.",

      "But the end of the transit deal has already caused serious tensions with Slovakia, which is now the main entry point of Russian gas into the EU and earned transit fees from piping the gas on to Austria, Hungary and Italy.",
      "Slovakia has said it will pay more for alternative routes. Its energy regulator announced in early December that Gas prices for consumers would rise in 2025.",
      "Robert Fico, Slovakia's prime minister, said on Wednesday that the end of the deal would have \"drastic\" consequences for EU countries, but not on Russia, Reuters reported.",
      "On Friday, Fico - who had just made a surprise visit to Moscow for talks with Putin - threatened to stop supplying electricity to Ukraine.",
      "This prompted Zelensky to accuse Fico of helping Putin \"fund the war and weaken Ukraine\".",
      "\"Fico is dragging Slovakia into Russia's attempts to cause more suffering for Ukrainians,\" the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Poland has offered to support Kyiv in case Slovakia cuts off its electricity exports - supplies that are crucial to Ukraine, whose power plants come under regular attack from Russia.",
      "Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were alternative gas supply routes from international markets, such as a terminal in Croatia and connections from Germany and Poland.",
      "\"These routes should be explored so that Russia doesn't make money on selling oil and gas to the European Union,\" Sikorski said.",
      "Poland is importing gas from the US, Qatar and the North Sea, he added.",
      "\"As far as I understand, all countries have alternative routes,\" he said.",
      "Moldova - which is not part of the EU - could be seriously affected by the end of the transit agreement. It generates much of its electricity at a power station fuelled by Russian gas.",
      "It also supplied the Russia-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, a small sliver of land sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine where around 300,000 people live.",
      "Russian gas company Gazprom had said on 28 December it would restrict gas to Moldova on 1 January because it said it had failed to fulfil its payment obligations.",
      "Dorin Recean, Moldova's prime minister, denied the alleged debt and accused Russia of using \"energy as a political weapon\" in a social media post. He said the move would leave Transnistria \"without light and heat in the middle of the winter\".",
      "Heat and hot water was cut off to Transnistria \"due to the temporary cessation of gas supplies\" at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday, energy company Tirasteploenergo said on Telegram.",
      "It urged residents to dress warmly, gather family members together in a single room, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows, and use electric heaters.",
      "The temperature was due to drop below 0C on Wednesday night. Medical institutions and hospitals were still being supplied, the company said.",
      "Moldova's energy minister, Constantin Borosan, said his government had taken steps to ensure stable power supplies, but called on citizens to save energy.",

      "It found that women working remotely were more likely to value being present for their families, while men were less inclined to interrupt their work schedules to address family needs.",
      "Its researchers suggested, however, that remote work can help employees with a better work-family balance if they are well supported.",
      "\"Businesses do have a role to play in that,\" Ms Crosbie said on Tuesday.",
      "\"We just need to be careful that we don't inadvertently prevent women from taking some of the opportunities by not being in the office when they feel it's beneficial both to their skills and to contribute to the business.\""

      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",

    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",

      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",

    "summary": "As condom use falls and sex infections rise, educators try to tackle misinformation among teens.",
    "story": [
      "Could the influence of pornography, OnlyFans and so-called \"natural family planning\" techniques explain the drop in teenagers' use of condoms?",
      "YMCA sexual health educator Sarah Peart said some boys were not willing to use them \"because they're not seeing that in pornography\".",
      "She said young girls were often \"targeted on social media\" by those endorsing hormone-free, period-tracking apps to avoid unwanted pregnancies.",
      "Young people have also said that controversial OnlyFans adult content creators set poor examples, who made headlines after bragging of having sex with several young men in a day.",
      "Footage also emerged of one OnlyFans creator saying she had not used condoms during oral sex, putting her at risk of HIV.",
      "\"We've had multiple young people say \"natural family planning\" is their main form of contraception,\" said Ms Peart, adding that the lack of positive role models and influencers was a challenge for those providing sex education.",
      "The YMCA sessions at schools, colleges and youth services attempt to inform, bust myths, discuss healthy relationships, but also hammer home the message that pregnancy is not the only risk.",
      "\"It's such a difficult barrier convincing young people that birth control isn't enough, and that you do need to protect yourself from STIs (sexually transmitted infections).\"",
      "She added they would also explain that \"natural family planning\" was not always reliable, \"especially at that age when maybe periods aren't regular and young people don't tend to be the most strict with keeping notes\".",
      "\"Our sessions also cover pornography and OnlyFans does sometimes come up as a strand of that.",
      "\"We try to educate young people to make their own healthy choices - and hopefully that includes not opening an OnlyFans account, but we can only provide the education.\"",
      "When BBC Wales asked young people for their thoughts, while many were too uncomfortable to speak publicly, most said buying condoms was seen as  too embarrassing.",
      "Liz Vieira, 20, from Llandysul, Ceredigion, said the decline in use of condoms - reported by the World Health Organization - did not surprise her given the prominence of adult content creators and their attitudes towards risk.",
      "\"I guess it's up to them, but as long as it's not meaning women in relationships are having a hard time. Because it sends a message it's OK to use women as you please. I don't think that's a good thing,\" she said.",
      "Mason Down and Dylan Steggles, from Cardiff, said sex education in school was also limited.",
      "\"We only had two days of it at school,\" said 18-year-old Dylan. \"And that was only an hour or two each time.\"",
      "\"There's more of that content online now [porn] so you can easily access it at a young age, which might influence how young people feel about condoms,\" said Mason.",
      "The sessions delivered by YMCA for young people include information on the C-Card scheme, which is a supported service across the UK, providing training on sexual health awareness, as well as free condoms, lubrication and dental dams.",
      "\"Condoms are really expensive, so it's a fantastic service to make them accessible, but also acceptable, and not some weird, dark hidden corner of the pub toilets,\" said Ms Peart.",
      "She is aware of fears the scheme could be seen as encouraging under-age sex but said research suggested more information at a younger age was likely to delay that.",
      "\"We try and persuade them to wait until they're at least 16. But if they are going to, then we can make sure they can do it in a safe way.\"",
      "The World Health Organization recently reported that 56% of 15-year-old girls in Wales, and 49% of boys, had not used a condom the last time they had sex.",
      "It comes amid a rise in STIs in the past year: 22% in chlamydia, 127% in gonorrhoea, and 14% in syphilis.",
      "Ellie Whelan and Megan Grimley, both 21, from Cardiff, said the move away from condoms surprised them given more of their peers had turned away from the pill or coil as forms of contraception.",
      "Use of long-acting, reversible contraception - such as an intra-uterine device (IUD) or hormonal implant - has fallen 22% in the last five years, with terminations up by a third.",
      "\"I think it's a lot to do with false information or bad experiences - or people are too scared to get information and talk about it,\" said Megan.",
      "How do I know if I have an STI?",
      "Testing is the best way to find out if you have a sexually transmitted infection.",
      "The Sexual Health Wales service offers a free test kit for over-16s which can be sent and returned by post or collected from community venues.",
      "Sexual health clinics across Wales also provide testing and support.",
      "Infections can take several weeks after contact to show up in a test.",
      "HIV takes seven weeks to be detected, hepatitis C and B can take 12 weeks or more, and chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show up within a fortnight.",
      "But it is not solely an issue for young adults. Ms Peart said the YMCA sessions explain the range of contraception available, but at the back of most classrooms is a teacher also taking notes, as the gap in STI knowledge in particular is on \"a national, societal level\".",
      "It is also reflected in the rise in sexually transmitted infections in the over-40s, according to Public Health Wales's Zoe Couzens, as people enter new relationships after divorce or bereavement.",
      "\"And I'm not putting an upper age on that \u2013 we've had a 72-year-old with chlamydia,\" she said.",
      "\"It's about ensuring the message goes out across all age groups.",
      "\"But the issue for the women especially is that pregnancy is not the concern they have any more, so they're not going to take the precautions. So that's another group that needs to be educated.\"",
      "Arguably the rise in cases is a result of increased testing, as the free \"test and post\" service by Public Health Wales has made that far more accessible.",
      "\"Chlamydia is the most common [STI] in Wales, followed by gonorrhoea - and while it's all treatable with antibiotics, gonorrhoea is a nasty little bug that is developing resistance to antibiotics.",
      "\"Twenty years ago we had two cases of syphilis in Wales - last year it was 507.",
      "\"It tends to be a silent infection, but it can develop into neuro syphilis and cause cardiac problems.\"",
      "Given other STIs can cause infertility, pain and pelvic inflammatory disease, the notion they are easily remedied is one many professionals wish to tackle.",
      "How do you get a sexually transmitted infection?",
      "Chlamydia is passed on through unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, sharing sex toys, or genital-to-genital contactGonorrhoea can be spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex without a condom, or the sharing of sex toysHIV is passed in infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal or rectal secretions, blood and breast milk, and the most common way to pass it on is through sex without a condom or sharing drug equipmentSyphilis is transmitted during unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, or through sharing sex toys, and it is also possible to pass on from mother to babyHerpes is highly contagious and is passed by skin-to-skin contact like vaginal, anal or oral sex, sharing sex toys, or oral sex with someone who has a cold soreGenital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",
      "Chlamydia is passed on through unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, sharing sex toys, or genital-to-genital contact",
      "Gonorrhoea can be spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex without a condom, or the sharing of sex toys",
      "HIV is passed in infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal or rectal secretions, blood and breast milk, and the most common way to pass it on is through sex without a condom or sharing drug equipment",
      "Syphilis is transmitted during unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, or through sharing sex toys, and it is also possible to pass on from mother to baby",
      "Herpes is highly contagious and is passed by skin-to-skin contact like vaginal, anal or oral sex, sharing sex toys, or oral sex with someone who has a cold sore",
      "Genital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",
      "What are the symptoms of an STI?",
      "Chlamydia: often described as a silent infection as most people do not have obvious signs. Symptoms can include pain when urinating, unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum. Women may get pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex and in between periods, while men can have pain and swelling in the testicles.",
      "Gonorrhoea: some people have no symptoms, but those who do may have a yellow or green discharge; a burning sensation when they wee and pain or tenderness in the stomach.",
      "Syphilis: many people won't have symptoms. But for those that do, it will start with a small, painless ulcer in the mouth or genitals, followed by a rash. If left untreated, the infection can result in visual impairment, dementia and death. In pregnancy it can also lead to miscarriages, still births and infant mortality.",
      "Herpes: again, some people have no symptoms, but they can include small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Blisters and ulcers can also be on the cervix; it can cause vaginal discharge, pain when having a wee, as well as general flu-like symptoms.",
      "Genital warts: in women they start as small, gritty-feeling lumps that become larger. In men the warts will feel firm and raised, with a rough surface. They can be single warts or grow in clusters.",

    "summary": "James Hunt says he will never regret becoming a full-time carer to his two autistic sons.",
    "story": [
      "James Hunt used to spend his days commuting to London, where he ran a successful marketing firm.",
      "But his children Jude and Tommy were diagnosed as autistic when they were toddlers, and he later decided to care for them and his parents full-time.",
      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",
      "It's somewhere for people in the community to visit, we have a sensory room in the shop and we get lots of parents coming in who want to have a chat.",
      "Everyone working in the shop is a parent, carer or is autistic, so they can share their experiences with customers.",
      "'I've learned to cherish the simple things'",
      "I always try to focus on the positives and not think too far ahead but there are days when my mind runs away with me.",
      "It will be a huge challenge when the boys leave school when they are 19.",
      "That's massively scary because suddenly you have to trust a whole new bunch of people.",
      "There is a part-time college I hope they can go to but it's a huge unknown and there will be big decisions to make.",
      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",
      "It has taught me to cherish and enjoy the simple things and I just want the boys to be happy.",
      "Looking back at how I felt when they were diagnosed, I would like to tell myself it's all going to be OK.",
      "Those first few years can be a really scary and emotional time. You feel like you have no idea what you're doing.",
      "Don't bottle everything up, find people to open up to. Your friends and family want to help, they just don't know how to yet.",

    "story": [
      "Wayne Osmond, a founding member of family band The Osmonds, who had a string of hits in the 1970s, has died at the age of 73.",
      "Wayne was a singer and guitarist, and co-wrote many of their biggest hits, including Crazy Horses, Goin' Home And Let Me In.",
      "\"Wayne brought so much light, laughter, and love to everyone who knew him, especially me,\" wrote brother Donny. \"He was the ultimate optimist and was loved by everyone.\"",
      "Merrill Osmond called his late brother \"a genius in his ability to write music\" who was \"able to capture the hearts of millions of people and bring them closer to God\".",
      "He continued: \"I've never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolute no guile. An individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.\"",
      "Merrill and Donny said the cause of death was a stroke.",
      "Born in August 1951, in Ogden, Utah, Wayne was the fourth oldest of nine children and raised in a Mormon household.",
      "As a child, he started performing in a barbershop quartet with siblings Alan, Merrill and Jay.",
      "By 1961, the harmonising brothers were regular performers at Disneyland in California. A year later, they made their TV debut on The Andy Williams Show.",
      "They quickly became regulars on the show, earning the nickname \"one-take Osmonds\" because of their flawless, tirelessly rehearsed performances.",
      "Younger sibling Donny joined the line-up in 1963, and they began to broaden their repertoire to include clean-cut pop songs.",
      "Their initial singles flopped but, after the success of the Jackson 5 showed that family pop could be a commercial success, MGM Records signed the band and sent them to work at the famed R&B studio Muscle Shoals.",
      "There, they were given a song called One Bad Apple (Don't Spoil the Whole Bunch), which had originally been written for the Jacksons but was rejected by their record label.",
      "Perky, bubbly and bright, the song topped the US singles chart for five weeks in 1971 and established the band as a chart presence, a decade after their professional debut.",
      "For a while, the siblings generated the same sort of fevered excitement as The Beatles.",
      "When the band flew into Heathrow Airport in 1973, 10,000 teenage fans packed the roof gardens at a nearby office block to see them arrive. Part of the balcony railing and wall collapsed amidst a crowd surge, slightly injuring 18 women.",
      "On their departure, hundreds of fans mobbed their limousine. A reporter for the New York Times said \"they were lucky to escape alive\", while the Guardian said the scenes almost led to a ban on pop groups entering the UK via Heathrow.",
      "But pop is a fickle industry, and The Osmonds' record sales started to tail off by the mid-1970s.",
      "At the same time, Donny and Marie Osmond were offered their own TV variety show, which became a massive hit in the US and was screened by BBC One in the UK.",
      "As a result, the band went on hiatus and ultimately dissolved in 1980, although they regularly reformed for county fairs and reunion tours over the coming decades.",
      "Wayne Osmond suffered a number of health problems during his life. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour as a child, which resulted in cognitive problems.",
      "In 1994, he noticed that the condition was worsening.",
      "\"I noticed I couldn't play my saxophone any more because my head would start throbbing,\" he later recalled. \"And my knees would fall out from under me when I was on stage. This all began happening within a week.\"",
      "The subsequent surgery and related cancer treatments resulted in significant hearing loss that persisted for the rest of his life. He also suffered a previous stroke in 2012.",
      "In 2019, the musician joined his siblings Alan, Merrill and Jay for their final ever performance on TV show The Talk.",
      "Performing in front of a screen that showed a montage of their career highlights, the original quartet performed a song called The Last Chapter, written as a thank you to their fans.",
      "Sister Marie, who presented the show, joined them afterwards to pay tribute, saying: \"I am so honoured to be your sister. I love you guys. You've worked so hard. Enjoy your retirement.\"",
      "Wayne spent his retirement indulging in hobbies including fly fishing, and spending time with his family. He maintained an optimistic outlook, telling Utah newspaper Desert News that hearing loss didn't bother him.",
      "\"My favourite thing now is to take care of my yard,\" he said. \"I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it's really joyful.\"",
      "He is survived by wife Kathlyn and five children, Amy, Steven, Gregory, Sarah and Michelle.",
      "He is also survived by his eight siblings: Virl, Tom, Alan, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie and Jimmy."

    "summary": "From superhero blockbusters to romantic comedies, Scotland has become an increasingly familiar filming location.",
    "story": [
      "From superhero blockbusters to Netflix romantic comedies, Scotland has become an increasingly familiar location for Hollywood to use.",
      "In the autumn, Twisters star Glen Powell could be seen in Glasgow shooting scenes for sci-fi tale The Running Man, while Edinburgh and Aberdeenshire will be the backdrop for a new version of Frankenstein.",
      "Those productions join a lengthy list of films and TV shows filmed in the country over the past decade.",
      "Tourism bosses hope successful productions can see Scotland follow the likes of New Zealand - where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films were shot - and Northern Ireland, which saw a tourism upswing from Game of Thrones fans looking to visit locations used in the fantasy series.",
      "Why does Hollywood like Scotland for filming?",
      "For some films, such as Orkney-set drama The Outrun or smash-hit TV show Outlander, filming on location in Scotland is a natural option given the stories themselves are set there.",
      "Scottish scenery and wilderness is distinctive, and can mostly be accessed relatively quickly from major cities, which helps.",
      "However, the past decade has seen cities across the country stand in for other places - something Ray Tallan, the head of film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, suggests is down to architecture cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh.",
      "He says it \"lends itself beautifully\" to the big screen.",
      "Mr Tallan also points to the increase in studio provision in the country, with the likes of First Stage Studios in Leith and Wardpark Film and Television Studios in Cumbernauld.",
      "Mr Tallan told BBC Scotland News:  \"This gives productions the flexibility to not just use Scotland for its scenery but now also its studio facilities.",
      "\"As more of these productions shoot here successfully, this provides confidence in the sector and an increase in reputation.\"",
      "There is another reason too - money.",
      "Like the rest of the UK, Scotland is able to offer tax breaks to productions, which adds to its appeal, as well as additional funding.",
      "For example, Glasgow City Council gave Warner Bros around \u00a3150,000 to shoot DC Comics film Batgirl in the city - only for the finished movie to never see the light of day after bosses at the studio decided not to release it.",
      "What locations can Scottish cities double as?",
      "Glasgow has been particularly adaptable, with its streets doubling for London in the  Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, as legendary comic book location Gotham City in the opening of comic book adventure The Flash, and as 1960s New York for a parade scene in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.",
      "Cheryl Conway, the head of Screen Commission at Screen Scotland, told BBC Scotland News the country has \"versatility\", which makes it appeal to studios.",
      "Of course, this can work the other way too: cheesy festive romcom A Merry Scottish Christmas used Duns Castle in the Scottish Borders for exterior shots, but nearly the entire film was, despite the title, filmed in Ireland.",
      "What films have been shot in Scotland?",
      "A considerable amount.  Recent fare includes...",
      "Frankenstein (Netflix) The Rig series 2 (Prime Video), Fear (Prime Video),Lockerbie: A Search for Truth (Sky)  One Day (Netflix), Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (Amblin) The Outrun (Arcade Pictures)Tetris (Apple TV+)Andor (Disney+)The Batman (Warner Bros.)California Schemin' (James McAvoy)Avengers: Infinity War (Marvel Studios) Avengers: Endgame (Marvel Studios)The Princess Switch Trilogy (Netflix)",

      "The Princess Switch Trilogy (Netflix)",
      "Does Scotland's economy benefit from filming?",
      "This is a more complicated issue.",
      "A regular concern when massive productions take over parts of the city is whether the disruption negatively hits local businesses.",
      "When the Batgirl film was axed, Glasgow City Council told the Daily Record that the production still provided \"a very significant economic benefit\" for the wider city.",
      "However, businesses in areas where filming occurred were less convinced, telling the BBC at the time that their trade had been adversely affected.",
      "The Social Recluse clothing shop on King Street in the Trongate area was given \u00a31,000 in compensation after having to close for 10 days for filming - something staff said didn't make up for a \"wasted month\".",
      "Other productions, such as Indiana Jones and the Running Man remake, have seen swathes of Glasgow altered and streets and roads blocked off, raising the question of whether those being directly affected are actually seeing any benefits.",
      "Dr Ewelina Lacka, of the Business School at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland News that economic benefits of films in Scotland were a \"mixed perspective\", particularly in regards to tourism.",
      "She explained: \"It's not only the film being made there but whether certain conditions are met, mainly related to destination management and marketing.",
      "\"It highlights the importance of something like Visit Scotland, in having a marketing strategy implemented before and after filming.\"",
      "What is the Outlander effect on Scottish tourism?",
      "The clearest example of a film or TV production boosting Scotland is Outlander, the hugely popular TV show based on books by American author Diana Gabaldon.",
      "Several companies now offer Outlander tours around Scotland, visiting locations used throughout the long-running series.",
      "Dr Lacka said: \"It's a diversion effect \u2013 people plan trips, and work in the filming locations as part of a wider visit.\"",
      "Mr Tallan agrees, saying: \"Outlander has an amazing reach globally and there is no doubt it has had an impact on tourism at locations where the production is shot.\"",
      "Does the homegrown Scottish film industry benefit from Hollywood productions?",
      "Screen Scotland believes the local film industry gains advantages from visiting big productions.",
      "Ms Conway said it enabled trainees and Scottish crews to gain \"vital experience\" and help secure \"sustainable careers\" in the long term.",
      "Mr Tallan agrees, saying more experienced crew members can move onto big productions, which in turn \"gives that opportunity for new blood to come in\" on smaller shoots.",
      "Where will we see Scotland on screen next?",
      "Glasgow was recently taken over for The Running Man, based on Stephen King's book and already adapted once in a 1980s action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "This time Glen Powell is the man forced to fight to survive on a ruthless game show, with Glasgow portraying a dystopian, futuristic city.",
      "Edinburgh and Aberdeenshire will be stepping in for 18th Century Germany in a new version of Gothic horror Frankenstein for streaming giant Netflix, directed by Guillermo Del Toro.",
      "The Hellboy director had an interesting experience while in Scotland - he posted on social media saying that he believed his hotel might be haunted.",
      "New Sky drama Lockerbie: A Search For Truth will be shown in January, with shooting having taken place in Linlithgow."

      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",

      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",

      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",

      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",

      "Is smaller the future?",

    "story": [
      "As Bradford begins its year as UK City of Culture, it is not just trying to show a different face to the rest of the country - it's also hoping to win over doubters in the city.",
      "One of the first productions is a radio play written by broadcaster Nick Ahad, and its theme is Bradford's battered reputation.",
      "\"The working title for this play was 'Bradford, City of Culture?!' because we knew that's what the reaction would be when people found out we would be the City of Culture for 2025,\" he explains.",
      "Ahad eventually settled on the excellent title Bilal and Ted's Bradfordian Adventure, and it's on BBC Sounds. One of the actors is Seeta Wrightson, a comedian from the city.",
      "\"I think it's really unfairly got a bad rep. And I think that's because in the news or on social media, people don't want to talk about good things.\"",
      "'Why is Bradford so\u2026?'",
      "Wrightson's not wrong.",
      "The headlines about Bradford are often brutal. In recent months, news stories have declared it Britain's gloomiest city (because it has the least sunshine) and the second most miserable place to live.",
      "Type the words \"Why is Bradford so\u2026.?\" into a search engine and see what happens.  The odds are you will probably get the following autofill options - \"bad\", \"dangerous\" and \"poor\".",
      "And it's not just the opinions of people outside the city. Dr Paul Sullivan of Bradford University has carried out research into the stigma. His hometown is Ireland's Cork, a place where its comedians make fun of its high opinion of itself. Bradford, he discovered, was rather different.",
      "\"What surprised me was... the almost lack of civic pride.",
      "\"Even reading the local newspaper, some of the headlines can be very upbeat, and beneath it are just loads of comments that, 'This is a disaster, it'll just never work, Bradford is doomed'.\"",
      "But Dr Sullivan is a fan.",
      "\"I love the city. I fell in love with Bradford straight away. I love the city centre, the beautiful countryside.  And it was really quite a surprise to me to see that level of negativity.\"",
      "Much of it, he believes, is rooted in an external and almost \"ideological hostility\" to the city's ethnic diversity.",
      "\"I think there's a reluctance to admit that Bradford can succeed. A desire for Bradford to fail.\"",
      "However, in the face of this antagonism, something is, he feels, developing.",
      "In his recent interviews with residents, \"there was a real sense of pride, in their sense of belonging\".",
      "It was a topic Ahad and Wrightson also raised. Diversity has become utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I'm Bangladeshi and English. My wife's Pakistani and Indian, and you sort of don't have to explain here,\" says Ahad.",
      "\"Like 100%,\" Wrightson adds. \"I'm mixed heritage, my mum's Indian, my dad's English. And growing up, it wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "City of Culture has for many become a moment to look beyond the problems and champion what's growing out of its diversity.",
      "People feel welcomed",
      "Natalie Davies, an actor and writer from Bradford, is creating a play about the city's nightlife.",
      "\"The stigma that's been attached for years is old now, and that's not what Bradford is.",
      "\"I'm very lucky. I've worked in television, I've worked in film, I've worked in theatre and radio, and every time I go on to a set, I always champion Bradford.",
      "\"This is actually a great place, and the thing about it is anybody from anywhere could come to Bradford and feel like they belong and we hold that. People come and completely feel welcomed.",
      "\"It's beautiful.\"",
      "City of Culture has also been a chance for people to take stock of Bradford's cultural history and the famous names that have come from here.",
      "Among them are artist David Hockney, playwright JB Priestley, composer Delius and the Bronte sisters.",
      "\"Emily Bronte, you just take it for granted that she's from Bradford,\" says Wrightson.",
      "For her, City of Culture has been a moment to look at what makes the city special.  And again and again, talking to younger Bradfordians, while some might mention the Brontes, the spectacular Victorian architecture, the first free school meals or the diversity - almost everyone seems to agree that the city's food is key.",
      "Of course, no two people ever seem to agree as to where you can get the best curry, but perhaps one of the best known restaurants is Akbar's, famous for the creation of the giant hanging naan.",
      "Created to save space on a table, the family naan grew to a size that has defeated even the largest Yorkshire appetite.",
      "\"People have tried. None have succeeded,\" says Samad Iqbal, who started working at Akbar's aged 15 and is a proud ambassador for a city that describes itself as the Capital of Curry.",
      "\"Some people call it elephant ears. Some people call it a Christmas tree. But this family naan has gone worldwide.",
      "\"I am very proud of Bradford, I'm born and bred here. It's a fantastic place to live, a fantastic place to eat. It's places like this which show the true spirit of Bradford.\"",
      "It appears Bradford 2025 has already begun to have an effect. It has, says Dr Sullivan, encouraged people to talk positively about the city.",
      "\"In the last couple of years we have seen a change. I am speaking from opinion here now rather than research, but I think we have seen a shift towards civic pride, and I think the catalyst for that really coming to fruition will be Bradford 2025.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:46:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The show has returned to our screens for a third series, but with a few key changes to the format.",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:46:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Willem Dafoe reflects on the appeal of Dracula: \"It's interesting to have the undead visit the living\".",
    "story": [
      "When I meet Willem Dafoe on Zoom to discuss his latest movie Nosferatu, we get on to mortality fast.",
      "The four-time Oscar-nominated actor is talking to me for Radio 4's Today programme about Robert Eggers' remake of the 1922 silent film of the same name, which was an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",
      "Nosferatu is the tale of a terrifying vampire who is infatuated with a haunted young woman called Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.",
      "The story that unfolds involves a lot of death. Where creatures that feed on human blood are concerned, that's pretty standard. But Dafoe, who plays a vampire-hunting professor of the occult in the film, tells me in real life too \"we're all somewhere considering death all the time\".",
      "For him, that's one explanation for the popularity of vampire stories.",
      "Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has been adapted numerous times, and vampires in general are never far from our screens.",
      "Dafoe rationalises the enduring appeal of the subgenre like this: \"It's a very interesting proposition to have the undead visit the living, and it becomes something of a meditation of the dark side of things versus the light\".",
      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",
      "It's perfect for Dafoe, who tells me he doesn't like to work too much with computer-generated imagery (the green screen and other visual effects that have become integral to filmmaking).",
      "\"You need to earn the authority to pretend, and through the technology, that gets lost\".",
      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",
      "He pointed to \"the shadow side\" of these occasions, \"a time when some people fall into depression because they fall out of that happiness\".",
      "It's true that his film work offers up both sides - the joy and the pain of life, the extremes of being human and everything in-between.",
      "He tells me that if you don't recognise there is a shadow side to life, \"you're going to become a victim of it some day\".",
      "As I look at him on the computer screen, it's impossible not to reflect on how expressive his face is - a face that could be carved from the earth.",
      "He tells me he only realised it when he started being photographed on the red carpet.",
      "\"Man, they get some ugly pictures of me. They get some grotesque pictures and they get some nice pictures\".",
      "He puts that down to his face having \"range\".",
      "\"I never think about my face,\" he goes on. \"If I ever do, it's really just to tell it to calm down\".",
      "Nosferatu is released in the UK on 1 January 2025.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.",
    "story": [
      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",
      "\"It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.\"",
      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",
      "Romantic beginning",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, got together after meeting on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005.",
      "\"Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened,\" Jolie told Vogue in 2007.",
      "Both had been married before - Pitt to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie to actors Jonny Lee Miller (1996 to 2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000 to 2003).",
      "Jolie and Pitt share six children together.",
      "Jolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 a few months after he was born. Pitt later adopted him after he and Jolie had begun their relationship.",
      "In 2005, the pair adopted daughter Zahara from Ethiopia when she was a few months old.",
      "The couple's first biological child, Shiloh, was born in Namibia in 2006. Earlier this year, it was reported that Shiloh had submitted a petition to a court to drop Pitt from her name.",
      "Their son Pax was adopted at the age of three from Vietnam in 2007, and twins Knox and Vivienne were born in 2008.",
      "Beginning of the end",
      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",
      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",
      "\"It was the right decision,\" she said. \"I continue to focus on their healing.\"",
      "In an interview with GQ in 2017, Pitt spoke about his decision to quit drinking and smoking marijuana, saying the split had been a \"huge generator for change\".",
      "Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of \"vitriolic hatred\" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.",
      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",
      "Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval together in 2008 and got married in its small chapel in 2014.",
      "But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to Pitt's lawsuit. He is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the estate, saying they agreed not to sell their shares without the permission of the other. Jolie has not publicly commented.",
      "Emotional fallout",
      "Few details of the divorce proceedings have been revealed. Private judges are often hired in the US to mediate disputes between divorcing celebrities for privacy reasons.",
      "Their children are now all aged between 16 and 23, and showbiz journalist Jeanne Wolf emphasised the emotional fallout.",
      "\"It's been a very emotional and complicated divorce settlement. It's taken a big toll on the children and the couple involved,\" she said.",
      "\"They have tried very hard not to let too many details known about what went on in that marriage.\"",
      "Jolie's lawyer highlighted the passage of time in his statement on Monday. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Johnnie Walker's long radio career was shaped by his early years as a pirate broadcaster in the 1960s, bobbing around on the ocean on Radio Caroline.",
      "Even 50 years later, his wife Tiggy would refer to him as \"the pirate\".",
      "It remained more than apt, given that his subsequent time on mainstream radio was marked by more than a few battles with the bosses.",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Rebel spirit",
      "His DJ career began at the age of 21, when he was first given a chance to play records on 'Swinging' Radio England, a boat moored four miles off the Essex coast.",
      "In return, they asked that he change his name - from Peter Dingley to the rather more rock 'n' roll-sounding Johnnie Walker.",
      "The boat was one of a number of floating stations that had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that allowed them to get round the BBC's monopoly on the UK airwaves to bring the sound of 60s pop to the nation's radios - something the BBC had up to that point largely resisted.",
      "Walker took to the rebel spirit. His years at public school had fostered a loathing of authority, and he had gone out of his way to fail his O-levels. Radio allowed him to embrace his passion - music - especially the rock, soul and underground sounds that were not making it to the top of the singles chart.",
      "Occasionally, he would row across to another boat, Radio London, to chat to a kindred spirit, a young DJ who was beginning to make a name for himself, John Peel.",
      "It wasn't tea he was talking about",
      "Walker then moved to the pirate mothership, Radio Caroline.",
      "His style was laid back, conversational and a contrast to the highly formatted slick patter of many other DJs.",
      "That attitude may have had something to do with his favoured means of relaxation on board. He even had an on-air code - he said the boat was running short of tea to signal that they were running out of his preferred type of herbal cigarette.",
      "His time on board also coincided with the government\u2019s decision to crack down on the pirates. Walker was on air at midnight of 14 August 1967, when the law making the pirates illegal came in to force.",
      "He read out a defiant speech declaring: \"We belong to you and we love you.\" His reputation as a symbol of the spirit of the pirates was assured.",
      "Undone by the Bay City Rollers",
      "However, in 1969 he switched sides and joined the establishment, BBC Radio One. It was not the easiest of relationships.",
      "He was, he said, accused of being \"too into the music\". He would pepper his shows with album tracks and songs outside the approved playlist.",
      "When he championed Walk on the Wild Side, Lou Reed\u2019s song about sex, drugs and transgender bohemia, his BBC boss had questions. It only stayed on the playlist because they had never encountered the phrase \"giving head\".",
      "Walker also loved Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles; Chirpy, Chirpy Cheep, Cheep, not so much.",
      "The cheery, cheeky sound of 70s mainstream radio was not his thing. At one Radio One event, he and Peel remembered watching, stunned, as fans of the Bay City Rollers brought chaos.",
      "\"Bay City Roller fans were jumping into the lake to be near their idols who were in a boat. John Peel turned to me and said, 'Johnnie, take note, this is one of the most bizarre sights you will ever see'.",
      "\"And then speeding into view came Tony Blackburn in another boat, being steered by a Womble.\"",
      "Cocaine, court and punk rock",
      "Not long after that, he parted company with Radio One after describing the Bay City Rollers as \"musical garbage\". He decided to leave for the freedom of US radio. It had its ups and downs.",
      "KSAN in San Francisco, with its relaxed FM rock playlist, seemed a perfect match until punk came along. It was not to the manager's taste and Walker was soon looking for work elsewhere.",
      "His sideline of sending pre-recorded shows back to Radio Luxembourg also came to an end when he played a record at the wrong speed.",
      "By the early 80s, he was back in the UK and on the dole.",
      "His return to the airwaves included a spell in independent local radio before he returned to the BBC. He again came a cropper at BBC GLR after saying there would be dancing in the streets when Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister in 1990.",
      "But, despite the setbacks, he eventually found a home at Radio 2.",
      "However, that almost came to an end when the News of the World's infamous fake sheikh staged a sting in 1999 and got him to reveal his drug habit. It was, he said, his lowest point. But after a trip to rehab, a \u00a32,000 fine and a promise that he had changed his ways, he was allowed back on to Radio 2.",
      "And that is where he stayed. He was even awarded an MBE.",
      "Sounds of the 70s",
      "The music that had been frowned on by the bosses in the 70s was now classic rock and he had a loyal fanbase who recognised him as one of their own.",
      "Being \"too into the music\" had paid off, he was now the authentic voice of the Sounds of the 70s.",
      "He presented the show of that name, and Radio 2's Rock Show, until health problems forced him to retire in October, after 58 years on the air.",

      "Why was Liam in Argentina?",
      "Payne was visiting his former bandmate Niall Horan, who was in the country on tour.",
      "He posted on Snapchat earlier in October that he was visiting Horan for a catch-up, saying: \"It's been a while since me and Niall have spoken, we've got a lot to talk about.\" He added: \"No bad vibes or anything like that, but we need to talk.\"",

      "He documented much of his trip on Snapchat, including pictures of food, plans to play polo, and jokes about his hair. We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "Payne's friend Roger Nores was at the hotel with him but left at 16:11 local time (20:11 BST) on 16 October, Argentine prosecutors have said.",
      "Payne was then in the hotel lobby and was unable to stand \"due to the consumption of various substances\", they said.",
      "At 16:54, cameras recorded him being dragged unconscious by three people - led by chief receptionist Esteban Grassi - and taken to his room, according to prosecutors.",
      "Grassi called emergency services at about 17:00, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",
      "\"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" Grassi said in a second call.",

      "Payne's room was on the third floor and had a balcony about 14m (45ft) above an interior courtyard.",
      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "Police say they found his room in \"total disorder\". Local media later published pictures purportedly from his room, showing a TV with a broken screen, multiple bottles, cans, candles, aluminium foil and a half-full glass of champagne.",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "However, following a further forensic report and an inspection of the scene on 5 December, a judge said that, in his state of intoxication, Payne \"tried to leave the room through the balcony\" and fell to his death.",

    "story": [
      "The number of people with flu in hospital in England has quadrupled over the past month and is rising \"at a very concerning rate\", NHS chiefs have warned.",
      "Latest data shows there were 5,000 patients with the virus being treated in hospital at the end of last week - almost 3.5 times higher than the same week in 2023, although not as high as in 2022.",
      "The head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told the BBC that pressure on hospitals is \"unacceptably awful\" and flu is pushing them to breaking point.",
      "It comes as health officials warn about the impact of the very cold weather expected this weekend on vulnerable patients, and the health system.",
      "Prof Julian Redhead, NHS national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said the figures show \"the pressure from flu was nowhere near letting up before we headed into the new year, skyrocketing to over 5,000 cases a day in hospital as of the end of last week and rising at a very concerning rate\".",
      "\"With what looks like an extreme cold snap expected right across England ahead of the weekend, we know the low temperatures can be dangerous for those who are vulnerable or have respiratory conditions,\" he added.",
      "Prof Redhead says people at risk should try to keep warm and make sure they are stocked up on any regular medication.",
      "It is not unusual to see an increase in flu during winter. The UK Health Security Agency says \"this was anticipated\" and that is why it has been urging those eligible to have a free flu vaccine, particularly health and social care workers.",
      "Some 33% of pregnant women, 37% of people in an at-risk group and 73% of over-65s have had the jab, according to the latest vaccination figures.",
      "'Lack of beds'",
      "Hospitals have put extra beds in place this year to help deal with the pressure on admissions created by flu and other winter viruses, including Covid and norovirus (the winter vomiting bug).",
      "NHS chiefs say they have also added more support for people who frequently need emergency services, with more care being delivered outside hospitals.",
      "Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS had done \"all it could\" in advance to reduce risk to patients, but the service remained in a position of \"national vulnerability\" with \"intense pressures\" starting to impact local services.",
      "Figures for last week show some 12,200 patients were left waiting in ambulances for more than an hour before they could be cared for in hospital.",
      "Dr Adrian Boyle, head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was a very difficult time for both patients and staff.",
      "\"What we are seeing is ambulances are frequently stuck outside emergency departments, and our emergency departments are full.\"",
      "He said there was \"an enormous amount of avoidable harm - excess deaths that shouldn't be happening\".",
      "\"Flu is the straw that is breaking the camel's back - because we have this chronic lack of beds within our hospitals, and we don't use those beds properly because we haven't reformed social care,\" he added.",
      "His criticism comes on the day the health and social care secretary set out plans for reforming adult social care in England, although they are unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest.",
      "A number of hospitals across different regions in England have restricted visits and asked patients and visitors to wear face masks to prevent further spread of flu.",

    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",
      "Helen Walker, the head of Carers UK, which represents millions of unpaid people who provide care to family members, said families were \"under intense pressure and providing more care than ever before\".",

    "summary": "The Olympic medallist had a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy. Did sport affect her ability to conceive?",
    "story": [
      "Dame Laura, 32, gave her body to cycling for more than a decade. She is Britain's most successful female athlete.",
      "\"Every training session I went in there to give 100%, every race I went in there to give 100%.",
      "\"I took it to the limit - if I wasn't sick after a race I'd be like, 'Did I try hard enough?'\"",
      "That absolute commitment was rewarded in the velodrome. Two golds at the London 2012 Olympics were followed by two more at Rio 2016.",
      "She married fellow cycling phenomenon Jason Kenny later that year and the couple welcomed their first baby, Albie, in 2017. She then secured another gold and silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021).",
      "But she miscarried in November 2021 and five months later had an ectopic pregnancy, in which the embryo implants outside of the womb, requiring emergency surgery.",
      "\"Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "She had never really worried about her own fertility before. Conceiving Albie had been straightforward, and that pregnancy went smoothly. And thankfully, she would successfully give birth to another son, Monty, in July 2023.",
      "But - as Dame Laura began to talk publicly about her baby losses - other athletes told her they had been through the same thing.",
      "It has left a nagging question - could elite sport have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes?",
      "\"Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'\" she says.",
      "Miscarriage is common. The NHS says one-in-eight known pregnancies end before 24 weeks and many occur at a very early stage. Most couples never find out why.",
      "But are athletes at greater risk of any type of fertility problem?",
      "Dr Emma O'Donnell, an exercise physiologist at Loughborough University, says the lifestyle of a professional athlete puts a unique strain on the human body.",
      "Elite training burns a phenomenal number of calories and, as a result, athletes' bodies are often lean and muscular, containing very little body fat.",
      "If they don't eat enough food to keep up with the calorie burn then issues with menstrual cycles, such as periods stopping for months or even years, are \"very common\", Dr O'Donnell says.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of female athletes experience interrupted periods, particularly in endurance sports. There are comparably high rates of periods disappearing in competitors in sports like gymnastics, ballet and figure skating. This compares to only 2-5% of the general population.",
      "Absent periods can be a sign that ovulation (or egg release) isn't happening.",
      "How does that happen in the body?",
      "\"We're not 100% sure,\" says Dr O'Donnell, but the leading idea is that having a baby is so energy-intensive that the brain shuts off reproduction if it thinks there is insufficient spare energy.",
      "It starts in the hypothalamus, a small structure in the centre of the brain that senses the nutritional state of the body.",
      "Sitting just underneath the hypothalamus is the body's hormone factory - the pituitary gland.",
      "Normally, the gland releases hormones that travel down to the womb and ovaries to control the monthly menstrual cycle and the release of an egg, which makes pregnancy possible.",
      "But if the hypothalamus isn't happy, this process breaks down and ovulation doesn't happen.",
      "\"If you're not ovulating you can't have a baby. You can't conceive because there's no egg being released,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "The biggest factor in this seems to be the huge number of calories burned while training, which can leave athletes struggling to eat enough food to compensate.",
      "This phenomenon is known as relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), and was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014.",
      "But other factors are also likely to be involved, says Prof Geeta Nargund, a consultant at St George's Hospital and medical director of Create Fertility.",
      "Fat in the body helps make the sex hormone oestrogen.",
      "\"If the sport is affecting body fat content, then quite clearly there's an effect on oestrogen levels,\" she says.",
      "Psychological stress \u2013 potentially from the pressures of training and competing \u2013 can also disrupt the menstrual cycle.",
      "\"We do see this in women with high levels of anxiety,\" said Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Disruption to periods and egg release is the most clearly recognised impact on a female athlete's fertility, but this should resolve once they retire from competition, she notes.",
      "Ectopic and miscarriage",
      "For those who do manage to conceive, things can still go wrong. After an egg is fertilised, it should implant into the lining of the womb. However, in an ectopic pregnancy the egg implants elsewhere, usually in the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb.",
      "Around 11,000 pregnancies a year in the UK are ectopic. It's not completely clear why they happen, although inflammation and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can increase the risk.",
      "\"But in this case, I don't see a direct link between sports and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy,\" said Prof Nargund, who has treated athletes struggling with their fertility.",
      "However, she said there was a potential link between too much intense exercise in the first three months of pregnancy and miscarriage \u2013 although far more research is needed to be certain.",
      "She pointed to a large Danish study that followed more than 90,000 women and suggested the more intense exercise women did, the higher the risk. This was particularly for weight-bearing and high-impact exercises.",
      "\"If you end up in the Laura Kenny territory where you're an elite athlete, you're the very top of that,\" Prof Nargund said.",
      "But she explained the findings needed to be taken \"with caution\" because the way the study was designed meant there could be other explanations that had not been considered.",
      "Meanwhile, a very small study of 34 Norwegian athletes found no increased risk of fertility problems, including miscarriage.",
      "\"We need to do a lot more research when it comes to sports, exercise, hormone balance and reproduction,\" says Prof Nargund.",
      "Athletes freezing their eggs",
      "Lauren Nicholls played elite level netball for 10 years then had two children, before becoming coach of Super League champions Loughborough Lightning. She says the conversations current players have about fertility are different to the ones she had with her teammates.",
      "\"I know a few of the slightly older players - they've frozen eggs and made those decisions for their family for a later date,\" she says. \"Because they're worried about their career.\"",
      "Juggling being an elite athlete and starting a family has always been a tricky challenge. For women, their years of peak fertility overlap with the time they hit their physical peak.",
      "Male athletes are also not immune to fertility issues. Burning more energy than you have coming in may affect testosterone levels, cause sperm abnormalities and even erectile dysfunction.",
      "But for Dr Emma Pullen, a sports exercise researcher at Loughborough, the lack of definitive answers on the impact of elite sport is emblematic of how poorly female athletes have been researched, from fertility to injury risk.",
      "She said research was \"playing catch up\" with the amount of attention on male sport.",
      "\"We're seeing the repercussions of that with growing professionalisation of women's sports and more female athletes than ever before,\" Dr Pullen adds.",
      "Overall, Prof Nargund argues female athletes are likely to face more fertility challenges than other women.",
      "\"There seems to be a fertility problem because of [elite sport's] potential effect on ovulation, including potentially a higher risk of miscarriage,\" she says.",
      "But a definitive answer on exactly how much elite-level exercise is too much is not clear. And that's enough for Dame Laura, for now.",
      "\"The conversation in itself I feel is really important because I want people to start talking,\" Laura says. \"Honestly, I would love it if it was a lot more open.\"",
      "The relationship between exercise and fertility affects all of us though, even if we're a long way from Olympic glory.",
      "How does exercise affect everyone else's fertility?",
      "Most men and women benefit from exercising and losing excess weight before trying to conceive \u2013 this is known to boost fertility.",
      "Regular physical activity reduces stress, improves sleep and makes periods more regular in those with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",
      "But amateur female athletes who train intensively can also end up running on empty and seeing their periods stop, or become irregular.",
      "\"Not to quite the same extent, but it's there,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Making sure there's a balance between energy intake and energy output is \"really important to ovulatory cycles\" and the key to maintaining reproductive function, she adds.",
      "\"[Amateur athletes] are not aware of the fact of how many calories they really need to put in to meet that energy demand.\""

    "summary": "The first steps to creating a National Care Service are announced - but critics say the pace of the plan \"feels far too long\".",
    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",
      "Helen Walker, the head of Carers UK, which represents millions of unpaid people who provide care to family members, said families were \"under intense pressure and providing more care than ever before\".",
      "The government also confirmed an extra \u00a386m would be spent before the end of the financial year in April to help thousands more elderly and disabled people to remain in their homes.",

    "story": [
      "A group of MPs says compensation is not being paid quickly enough for the victims of the Post Office scandal and is calling for the government to face financial penalties if the process doesn't speed up.",
      "The Business and Trade Select Committee said binding timeframes were needed, with any money arising from missed deadlines going to the claimants if they weren't met.",
      "The committee also called for the Post Office to be removed from its role in the compensation schemes, and asked for more transparency over how much it was paying for lawyers.",
      "The government said it was \"working tirelessly\" to settle claims \"at a faster rate than ever before\".",
      "Committee chairman Liam Byrne MP said: \"The fault lies with the Post Office, but ultimately government is the shareholder in the Post Office and acts on our behalf\".",
      "The government is already looking at the Post Office's role in the compensation schemes.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted and convicted based on information from a faulty accounting system, Horizon, which made it look like money was missing.",

      "One of those accused, Seema Misra, was eight weeks pregnant when she was wrongfully imprisoned.",
      "Speaking to the BBC after she was made an OBE in the King's New Year list for her role in campaigning for justice, she said it was an acknowledgement of the \"scale of the injustice and scandal\".",

      "It found the application process was akin to a second trial for the victims, adding that lawyers administering the schemes were making millions whilst the vast majority of the money set aside for redress had still to be paid out.",
      "The committee's recommendations include providing upfront legal advice for victims and hard deadlines for administrators to approve claims - with financial penalties if they take too long.",
      "Only around \u00a3499m of the budgeted \u00a31.8bn has been paid out so far, to more than 3,000 claimants. The committee said that meant 72% of the budget had still not paid.",
      "Many of those with the most complicated claims have still to be fully settled.",

      "Byrne added that hard deadlines and fines would help the government and the Post Office to \"get a grip\".",
      "A Post Office spokesperson said the firm was \"focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible\", adding that its spending on external law firms was kept \"under constant review\".",
      "\"Our chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the government, and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter,\" the spokesperson added.",

      "The Post Office told the select committee in December that legal fees had made up \u00a3136m of the cost of administering the Post Office-led schemes since 2020, which is around 27% of the compensation paid out.",

      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",

      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",

      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",

      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",

    "story": [
      "Visitors' books from Downing Street signed by some of the most famous figures in recent history have been made public for the first time.",
      "World leaders and members of the Royal Family are among the names in the three red leather, gilt-tooled volumes being released by the National Archives, spanning 1970 to 2003.",
      "The names of visitors to No 10 are not made public so the books provide a valuable record of who had private conversations with prime ministers.",
      "One of the volumes was offered for sale earlier this year by a London auction house who said it had been rescued from a waterlogged basement by a former civil servant, but the government blocked the sale saying it was Crown property.",
      "Dr Jack Brown, lecturer at King's College London described the books as \"wonderful... historical novelties\".",
      "As the first resident researcher at No 10, he explained the book wasn't left on a table for everyone to sign, but only offered to special guests.",
      "Some left private messages, especially to Margaret Thatcher, who spent more than a decade in Downing Street from 1979 to 1990.",
      "In 1989, then US President George Bush wrote: \"With Respect, Friendship and Gratitude for this Relationship that means so much\".",
      "Dr Brown said he was referring to the so-called special relationship between Britain and the US, rather than a personal bond, but President Bush's wife Barbara also signed, adding: \"Me. Too.\"",
      "Relations with fellow EU leaders were not always so smooth.",
      "That same year the French Prime Minister Michel Rocard wrote: \"It always is an extraordinary occasion to confront with the Prime Minister, especially when we agree, even when we disagree. Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"That was wonderful,\" said Dr Brown, \"I think you did confront with Thatcher... particularly if you were a socialist French prime minister, towards the end of her term.\"",
      "The visitors' book seems to have been introduced by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, who was in office from 1970-1974.",
      "Among the earliest to sign it were members of the Royal Family, who left just their first name, including in March 1971 an entry which reads \"Charles\", from the then Prince of Wales.",
      "Many Asian and African leaders signed the first volume. One name from 12 July 1971, in uneven letters reads: \"General I Amin Dada\" \u2013 Idi Amin of Uganda.",
      "Amin had taken power in a coup six months before, and the brutal nature of his regime wasn't yet clear to Western governments. In 1971 he was invited to Buckingham Palace, as well as Downing Street.",
      "Just a year later, Amin expelled tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, giving them only 90 days to leave the country. Many held British passports and came to settle in the UK.",
      "Among the world leaders - including Jimmy Carter, Ferdinand Marcos and Indira Gandhi - is an anomaly, four pages packed with signatures of well-known British women of 1978 - Anna Ford, Cleo Laine, Prue Leith and Janet Street-Porter.",
      "The latter was a well-known face on TV, but Janet Street-Porter remembers being intimidated by the event, a reception to mark 50 years of equal suffrage.",
      "\"I always appeared cocky and self-assured,\" she said, \"but to be invited to Downing Street for something so historically important was quite a formidable experience for me.\"",
      "While there were many receptions in Downing Street, the book was brought out for very few \u2013 including to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Downing Street in 1985.",
      "The Queen and Prince Philip signed, as did six other prime ministers, including the increasingly frail Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton.",
      "The book captures the changing times: President Mikhail Gorbachev signed in April 1989, when he came for a state visit with his wife, Raisa.",
      "Early the following year, the leaders of the newly independent Eastern European countries visited No 10 - including Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who added his trademark little heart.",
      "The book seems to have been rarely used by John Major and Tony Blair, though there is one striking message from early 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks.",
      "Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote: \"Mr. Prime Minister, we are eternally grateful for your support for us at a time of great peril, you will always hold a special place in the minds and hearts of all New Yorkers and Americans.\"",
      "Dr Brown said \"despite being a seemingly semi-random collection of autographs\", the book was a \"story of Britain's place in the world\" told in these signatures over time.",

    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called President Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",
      "But for now officials are monitoring their timelines closely. US social media diplomacy is back and some of it is heading our way.",

      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",

      "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.",
      "Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.",
      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",
      "Much of what they gleaned from the DNA about the spread of the Vikings into Scandinavia tallied with historical records.",
      "This result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.",
      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",
      "\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.",
      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",
      "The technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there are a large collection of well preserved human remains.",
      "Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",
      "\"Historical sources show what was the case before and what was the case after, but there is nothing about what happened in between,\" he said.",

      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",

      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",

      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",

      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",

    "story": [
      "On a cold February night in 1946, a 15-year-old schoolboy made a surprising discovery as he peered out of his bedroom window.",
      "Michael Woodman, a keen amateur astronomer from Newport, had stayed up late waiting for his father to come home when he noticed something strange in the night sky.",
      "\"There was the constellation of Corona Borealis, but in the ring of the Corona, the second star down was bright - very bright,\" he explains.",
      "\"And I thought 'I've never seen anything like that before.'\"",
      "The next morning he wrote to the Astronomer Royal. The now 94-year-old smiles as he recalls the memory, surprised that his teenage self would be so bold.",
      "\"And bless me if the Astronomer Royal didn't reply, with a letter I've still got.\"",
      "Michael Woodman had witnessed a rare celestial event that briefly dazzled the heavens. Not only that, the Astronomer Royal informed him that he was the first person in the country to have seen this.",
      "He'd spotted a star system, about 3,000 light years away, called T Corona Borealis - or T Cor Bor for short - exploding into brightness, becoming visible in the night sky for a few short days.",
      "\"I hit the jackpot,\" he says.",
      "How to look for T Cor Bor",
      "Now a whole new generation of stargazers are scanning the skies again because scientists believe T Cor Bor ignites about every 80 years or so.",
      "On a crystal clear night, in the Dark Skies Reserve of Bannau Brycheiniog, also known as the Brecon Beacons, astronomers are setting up their telescopes.",
      "\"T Cor Bor is dim at the minute  - it's magnitude 10, well below what you can see with the naked eye,\" explains Dr Jenifer Millard from Fifth Star Labs.",
      "To find the area of sky where it should appear, she advises to first locate the plough and follow its handle to Arcturus. To the west of this star is the curved constellation of Corona Borealis, made up of seven stars, and where T Cor Bor will at some point light up.",
      "\"It is only going to be visible to the naked eye for a couple of days,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course, if you've got a small pair of binoculars or a small telescope, you'll be able to see it for a little bit longer because you've got that magnifying tool. But I do think that it is the short stint in the sky that makes it really special.\"",
      "The astronomical phenomenon is caused by the interaction between two stars orbiting each other.",
      "A small white dwarf, which is a dead star, is locked in a cosmic dance with a much larger red giant - a star that's reaching the end of its life.",
      "The compact white dwarf has an immense gravitational pull, so great that it steals material away from its larger neighbour.",
      "\"The gravity on the surface of the white dwarf is a million times the gravity we feel on Earth, so if we stood on it, we would be crushed instantly,\" explains Dr Jane Clark, from the Cardiff Astronomical Society.",
      "Over time, the material it grabs from the other star gets crushed and compressed - until eventually it triggers a nuclear explosion, releasing a huge amount of energy - a process known as going nova.",
      "\"And when that happens, it will shine like the best Christmas tree in town,\" says Dr Clark.",
      "Astronomers think this process happens on repeat, with an outburst from T Cor Bor occurring about every 80 years.",
      "But there aren't many records of this. And there have already been a few false alarms that T Cor Bor was about to appear - followed by a disappointing no show.",
      "But Dr Chris North from Cardiff University says astronomers around the world are poised to catch the light show, which will allow them to study this star in more detail than ever before.",
      "And he's hopeful it could appear soon.",
      "\"It seems that in the past, this has dimmed a little bit before it's actually erupted, and there are signs that maybe, at the moment, it's just dipping a little bit in brightness,\" he says.",
      "\"So maybe that's a hint that it's getting close to its eruption.\"",
      "Michael Woodman certainly wants to see T Cor Bor again.",
      "\"Somebody will get me into a car and drive me out into the wild somewhere so I can have a decent look. That's what we are hoping for,\" he says.",
      "And if he catches another glimpse of the light show, he believes it will put him in a very exclusive club - of just one.",
      "\"Eighty years on, we're all looking at the skies again, not only me, but the whole world apparently,\" he says.",
      "\"If I'm alive, if I see it, I will be the only one who's seen it twice.\"",
      "Then with a big broad smile and a little chuckle, he adds: \"Got to keep breathing!\""

    "story": [
      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "Listen to Business Daily: Crisis at Northvolt",
      "As the postmortem into the crisis continues, there are debates about the potential impact on Sweden's green ambitions.",
      "Northern Sweden, dubbed the \"Nordic Silicon Valley of sustainability\" by consultancy firm McKinsey, has swiftly gained global reputation for new industries designed to fast-track Europe's green transition.",
      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",
      "Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups.",
      "Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant.",
      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrow's World three decades ago.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",

      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",

      "Johnson already faced one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky.",
      "\"You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson,\" Massie said Thursday in a television interview.",
      "Several other Republicans had put themselves in the \"undecided\" column heading into the vote.",

      "Three lawmakers - Massie, South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman and Texas Congressman Keith Self - named other options to serve as the next speaker.",
      "That led Johnson to flee the House floor and lobby members to back him. Some 45 minutes later, he returned to the House chamber.",

      "\"When we left that small room, he convinced me and Keith (Self),\" Norman said. \"He (Johnson) said I will do that, just give me the chance. He knew and I knew if it went to the second ballot it was going to get tougher and tougher.\"",

I said, 'Mr. President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 20:41:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.",
      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 10:30:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Yoon Suk Yeol is being investigated for inciting an insurrection, yet police are unable to arrest him.",
    "story": [
      "The stand-off started long before dawn. By the time we arrived in the dark, an army of police had pushed back suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol's angry supporters, who'd camped out overnight hoping to stop his arrest. Some of those I spoke to were crying, others wailing, at what they feared was about to unfold.",
      "As dawn broke, the first officers ran up to the house, but were instantly thwarted - blocked by a wall of soldiers protecting the compound. Reinforcements came, but could not help. The doors to Yoon's house stayed tightly sealed, his security team refusing the police officers entry.",
      "For several hours the investigators waited, the crowds outside growing more agitated - until, after a series of scuffles between the police and security officials, they decided their mission was futile, and gave up.",
      "This is totally uncharted territory for South Korea. It is the first time a sitting president has ever faced arrest, so there is no rule book to follow - but the current situation is nonetheless astonishing.",
      "When Yoon was impeached three weeks ago, he was supposedly stripped of his power. So to have law enforcement officers trying to carry out an arrest - which they have legal warrant for - only to be blocked by Yoon's security team raises serious and uncomfortable questions about who is in charge here.",
      "The investigating officers said they abandoned efforts to arrest Yoon not only because it looked impossible, but because they were concerned for their safety. They said 200 soldiers and security officers linked arms, forming a human wall to block the entrance to the presidential residence, with some carrying guns.",
      "This is arguably part of Yoon's plan, leveraging a system he himself designed. Before he declared martial law last month \u2013 a plan we now know he cooked up months earlier \u2013 he surrounded himself with close friends and loyalists, injecting them into positions of power.",
      "One of those people is the current head of his security team, who took up the job in September.",
      "But although alarming, this situation is not entirely surprising. Yoon has refused to cooperate with the authorities over this investigation, ignoring every request to come in for questioning.",
      "This is how things reached this point, where investigators felt they had no choice but to bring him in by force. Yoon is being investigated for one of the most serious political crimes there is: inciting an insurrection, which is punishable by life in prison or death.",
      "Yoon has also spurred on his supporters, who have gathered in force outside his residence every day since the arrest warrant was issued. He sent them a letter on New Years' Day thanking them for \"working hard\" to defend both him and the country.",
      "Attempt to arrest S Korea president suspended after dramatic standoff",
      "Why is it so hard to arrest S Korea's  impeached president?",
      "The South Korean president's martial law gamble backfired: What was he thinking?",
      "Although most people in South Korea are upset and angry at Yoon's decision to impose martial law, a core of his supporters have stayed loyal. Some even camped overnight, in freezing temperatures, to try and stop police reaching his home.",
      "Many told me this morning they were prepared to die to protect Yoon, and repeated the same unfounded conspiracy theories that Yoon himself has floated \u2013 that last year's election was rigged, and the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces. They held up signs reading \"stop the steal\", a slogan they chanted over and over.",
      "Attention is also now on South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, and how far his powers extend; whether he could and should sack the president's security chief and force the team to allow his arrest. The opposition party says police should be arresting anyone who stands in their way.",
      "Although investigators have until 6 January to attempt this arrest again \u2013 this is when the warrant runs out - it is unlikely they will go in once more without changing their strategy or negotiating with the security team in advance. They will want to avoid a repeat of today's failure.",
      "They also have to contend with the throngs of Yoon's supporters, who now feel victorious and empowered. They believe they are largely responsible for the authorities' climb down. \"We've won, we did it,\" they have been singing all afternoon.",
      "As their confidence grows, so will their numbers, especially with the weekend approaching."

      "America's top doctor has called for risk warnings on alcoholic beverages, similar to the labels on cigarettes, following new research that links the drinks to seven types of cancer.",
      "The advisory from US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy says the \"majority of Americans are unaware of this risk\" that leads to about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually in the US.",
      "It would require an act of Congress to change the existing warning labels, which have not been updated since 1988.",
      "Mr Murthy has also called for reassessing recommended limits for alcohol consumption and boosting education efforts regarding alcoholic drinks and cancer.",
      "The Surgeon General, who is the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the federal government, said that alcohol was the third most common preventable cause of cancer after tobacco and obesity.",
      "\"The direct link between alcohol consumption and cancer risk is well-established for at least seven types of cancer ...regardless of the type of alcohol (e.g., beer, wine, and spirits) that is consumed,\" Mr Murthy said in a statement.",
      "This includes increased risk of cancer of the breast (in women), throat, liver, oesophagus, mouth, larynx and colon.",
      "The new report recommends health care providers should encourage alcohol screening and treatment referrals as needed, and efforts to increase general awareness should be expanded.",
      "The warning labels are currently required to state that women who are pregnant should not drink alcohol due to birth defect risks. It also must state that \"consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems\".",
      "Ireland to introduce alcohol label health warning",
      "Over the last two decades, countries have increasingly introduced warning labels to inform consumers about the health risks of alcohol.",

      "Ireland is the first country in the world to mandate a warning linking any level of alcohol consumption to cancer. From 2026, it will be a legal requirement for all bottles of alcohol in the Republic of Ireland to carry a label.",
      "South Korea also requires cancer-specific warnings on alcohol.",
      "In the US, only Congress can amend the new warning labels recommended by Mr Murthy, and it's not clear that the incoming Trump administration would support the change.",

    "summary": "Officials still do not know why a US Army soldier drove the Tesla more than 800 miles from Colorado to Las Vegas.",
    "story": [
      "US law enforcement is looking for clues to unravel the mystery behind the Tesla vehicle that exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas earlier this week, giving seven people minor injuries.",
      "The man who rented the Cybertruck - then drove it to the city and parked it in front of the hotel - has been identified as Matthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old active-duty US special forces soldier.",
      "Police found his lifeless body inside the charred Tesla with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. They also found fuel cannisters and more than a dozen firework mortars in the bed of the vehicle.",
      "On Thursday, there remained a heightened police presence at the hotel, located right off the busy Las Vegas strip. Yellow police tape cordoned off a small section of the hotel's entrance as employees worked to repair damage to the facade.",
      "Authorities continue to work and piece together information, and many questions remain.",
      "For example, it is unclear why Livelsberger rented the car - or if the perpetrator was intending to make a political statement ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House later this month.",
      "Why did Livelsberger drive to Las Vegas?",
      "One of the biggest unanswered questions is why Livelsberger rented the Tesla and drove it more than 800 miles (1,300km) from Colorado to Las Vegas.",
      "Las Vegas police said he rented the vehicle on 28 December in Denver. They were able to track his movements using photographs taken on the drive and information from Tesla's charging technology. He was the only one seen driving it, they said.",
      "The vehicle arrived in the city on Wednesday morning, less than two hours before the explosion, police said.",
      "Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said on Thursday that a body inside the vehicle was recovered. It was burned beyond recognition, but the county's coroner used DNA and dental records to confirm that Livelsberger had been inside the Cybertruck at the time of the blast. He was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide with a bombing that occurred immediately after,\" Sheriff McMahill said. He added that no motive for the incident had been established.",
      "Was the explosion meant to be a political statement?",
      "Another big question is whether the explosion was meant as a statement ahead of the change of US president later this month.",
      "Police have not found any evidence that links the alleged perpetrator to specific political beliefs, but they said they were investigating whether the incident was tied to the fact that President-elect Donald Trump owns the hotel, or that Elon Musk runs Tesla.",
      "Trump recently named Musk to co-lead a presidential advisory commission, the Department of Government Efficiency, after the two became close during Trump's campaign.",
      "\"It's not lost on us that it's in front of the Trump building, and that it's a Tesla vehicle,\" said Spencer Evans, an FBI agent based in Las Vegas, on Thursday.",
      "\"But we don't have information at this point that definitely tells us, or suggests, that (the incident) was because of a particular ideology,\" he said.",
      "Was it related to the attack in New Orleans?",
      "The explosion happened just a few hours after a man drove a pickup truck into New Year revellers on the crowded Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, killing 14 people and injuring dozens of others.",
      "That attacker has been identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old US citizen who also served in the US Army.",
      "President Joe Biden has said investigators are looking into whether the two incidents are linked, though so far nothing has been uncovered to suggest that is the case.",
      "But the question continues to be fuelled by the apparent similarities between the two incidents and some biographical details of the drivers of both vehicles.",
      "Both incidents happened in the early hours of New Year's Day. Both men served in the US armed forces - including at the Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) military base in North Carolina - and both completed a tour in Afghanistan. Both men also rented the vehicles they used through a mobile car rental application called Turo.",
      "However, police have said there is no evidence the two men were in the same unit or served at the same time at Fort Liberty. Although both were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, there is no evidence they served in the same province, location or unit.",
      "In the New Orleans attack, police recovered an Islamic State (IS) group flag from the vehicle used by Jabbar. They added that he posted videos to social media moments prior claiming allegiance to the group. Police have determined that Jabbar was acting alone.",
      "Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, there is no evidence that suggests that Livelsberger was motivated by IS, or that he and Jabbar had ever been in contact. Police have cautioned that the investigation remains active.",
      "What is Livelsberger's background?",
      "Livelsberger was a decorated special forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany, but was on approved leave at the time of the incident.",
      "His father told BBC's US partner CBS News that his son was in Colorado to see his wife and eight-month-old daughter.",
      "He said he last spoke to his son at Christmas and that everything seemed normal.",
      "The Daily Beast reported that Livelsberger was a \"big\" supporter of Trump. A senior law enforcement official who spoke with Livelsberger's family told the outlet that Livelsberger voted for Trump in November's election.",
      "His uncle told The Independent that Livelsberger loved Trump \"and he was always a very, very patriotic soldier, a patriotic American.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:21:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Yoon Suk Yeol has been impeached by parliament and suspended from office.",
    "story": [
      "There were more than 100 police officers and they were armed with a warrant, but South Korean authorities failed to arrest suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol after a six-hour deadlock outside his home.",
      "That's how long the confrontation with Yoon's security team lasted as they formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the arrest team's path, according to local media.",
      "It has been an unprecedented month for South Korean politics. Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order was followed by an impeachment vote against him. Then came the criminal investigation, his refusal to appear for questioning and, earlier this week, a warrant for his arrest.",
      "The right-wing leader still has a strong support base. Thousands of them turned up outside his home on Friday morning to oppose his arrest.",
      "But, by many accounts, Yoon is now a disgraced leader impeached by parliament and suspended from office, he awaits the decision of the constitutional court which can remove him from office.",
      "So why has it proven so difficult for police to arrest him?",
      "The men guarding the president",
      "Although Yoon has been stripped of his presidential powers - after lawmakers voted to impeach him - he is still entitled to a security detail.",
      "And those men played a key role in blocking the arrest on Friday.",
      "The presidential security service (PSS) could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon or under \"a misguided understanding of their legal and constitutional role\", says Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.",
      "Given that Yoon has been suspended, the PSS should be taking directions from acting President Choi Sang-mok. \"They have either not been instructed by acting President Choi to stand down, or they are refusing his orders to do so,\" says Assoc Prof Richey.",
      "Some experts believe the security officers were showing \"unconditional loyalty\" to Yoon, rather than the office itself. They point to the fact that the PSS's chief Park Jong-joon was appointed to the job by Yoon last September.",
      "\"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee.",
      "And that Park's predecessor was former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who is accused of advising Yoon to impose martial law. He is currently being held for questioning as part of the criminal investigation into Yoon.",
      "A risk of escalation",
      "The \"simplest\" solution, Mr Lee says, is for acting president Choi to order the PSS to stand down in the interim.",
      "\"If he is unwilling to do so, that may be grounds for his own impeachment by the National Assembly,\" he added.",
      "Choi, who is the finance minister, had stepped in to lead the country after lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon's first successor, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo.",
      "This political stalemate also reflects the polarisation in South Korean politics between those who support Yoon, and his decision to impose martial law, and those who oppose it. And the differences don't necessarily end there.",
      "The vast majority of South Koreans agree that Yoon's declaration of martial law on 3 Dec was wrong and that he needs to be held accountable, says Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, but they cannot agree on what accountability looks like.",
      "\"The actors involved disagree over process, procedure and their legal basis, which is adding to the current political uncertainty,\" she explains.",
      "That uncertainty is also creating tense stand-offs like the one that unfolded on Friday in and outside Yoon's presidential residence, where his supporters have been camping out for days, leading to heated speeches and even skirmishes with police.",
      "Law enforcement could return with more agents and use force but that would be \"highly dangerous,\" Assoc Prof Mason said.",
      "The PSS too is heavily armed, so arresting officers would be looking to avoid any escalation.",
      "\"What happens if the police show up with additional warrants calling for the arrest of PSS personnel, [the PSS] defy those warrants as well and then brandish their guns?\" Mr Lee asks.",
      "Police have now said they are investigating the PSS director and his deputy for obstructing them - so there could be more charges and arrest warrants coming.",
      "The fallout from Yoon's martial law order is also a challenge for the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) that is investigating him.",
      "It has only been operating for four years. It was created in response to public anger over former president Park Geun-hye who was impeached, removed from office and later jailed over a corruption scandal.",
      "While South Korean presidents have been jailed before, Yoon is the first one to face arrest before he steps down.",
      "Investigators have until 6 January to arrest Yoon before the current warrant expires.",
      "They may attempt to arrest Yoon again over the weekend, although the weekend could pose a bigger challenge if the crowds of supporters grow. They can also apply for a new warrant and try to detain him again.",
      "Given how far South Korea has now slid into uncharted territory, the uncertainty is likely to continue.",

    "summary": "Financial problems at battery maker Northvolt have shaken hopes for Sweden's green industry sector.",
    "story": [
      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",
      "Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups.",
      "Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant.",
      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

    "summary": "The Republicans' slim majority in the House faces a first test as Mike Johnson bids to return as speaker.",
    "story": [
      "As the world rings in a new year, lawmakers are convening on the US Capitol to kick off a new Congress.",
      "Friday marks the start of the 119th Congress, with Republican majorities in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "This marks a Republican trifecta given that President-elect Donald Trump is also returning to the White House later this month. The US hasn't seen unified control of all three branches of government since 2017, when Trump was last in office.",
      "Republicans are eager to get started on an ambitious to-do list, but things may not come easy - and their majorities in both chambers of Congress leave little room for disagreement. The first test of the party's unity comes on Friday with leadership elections in the House.",
      "Here are five things worth watching as the new session of Congress begins:",
      "1. A Republican trifecta, but barely",
      "Republicans may have the majority in the House, but not by much.",
      "And it will be put to the test as soon as the session begins. The House cannot certify election results or pass laws until lawmakers select their next speaker - the leader of the chamber.",
      "Despite an endorsement from Trump, current speaker Mike Johnson faces opposition from several members within his caucus who remain unconvinced he deserves a second chance.",
      "The party's majority is so small that if Johnson loses just two Republicans in his campaign, it could set off a series of ballots until Republicans coalesce around a lawmaker. In 2023, it took 15 rounds of votes and four days for Kevin McCarthy to win the speakership.",
      "Johnson already faces one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky, but several other Republicans have put themselves in the \"undecided\" column.",
      "The Republican Party was left with a five-seat majority when the final House races were called in the 2024 election. But that has shrunk after Trump tapped several House members to serve in his administration.",
      "\"Do the math,\" Johnson said during an early December press conference. \"We have nothing to spare.\"",
      "2. Confirming cabinet appointments",
      "In the Senate, lawmakers have already selected their majority leader: South Dakota Senator John Thune won an internal Republican Party vote.",
      "This means senators can move to official business on Friday, but they will face challenges in other ways. Lawmakers are scheduled to begin a string of confirmation hearings for some of Trump's controversial cabinet appointees.",
      "The Senate must sign off on some 1,200 appointments for the new president's administration, but some will come with the tense hearings that attract public attention. They'll first appear before a Senate committee and answer questions, before the full chamber votes.",
      "The nominees include Trump's pick for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who faces sexual assault allegations from 2017 which he denies, as well as his pick for health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is a vaccine sceptic with a history of spreading misinformation.",
      "Trump's picks were seen making their rounds on Capitol Hill last month to win over Republican senators. But nominees will have to appear before bipartisan committees - meaning the hearings could get heated as senators from both parties use their platform to address criticisms and grievances.",
      "However, the Senate could choose to expedite confirmation hearings from some national security nominees - following a New Year terror attack in New Orleans that left 14 dead and an explosion of a vehicle outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "\"The US Senate must confirm President Trump's national security team as soon as possible. Lives depend on it,\" Wyoming Senator John Barrasso wrote in a post on X.",
      "A nomination that clears a committee typically does not face opposition on the full Senate floor, but given some of the initial backlash over Trump's picks, the path to confirmation may be bumpy.",
      "3. A move on taxes",
      "One item that rises to the top of the legislative to-do list for Congress is addressing Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which expires in 2025.",
      "The 2017 legislation - which passed at a time when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate - involved a $1.5tn (\u00a31.2tn) overhaul of the tax code, changed tax brackets and lowered tax rates for most taxpayers.",
      "It marked the biggest tax overhaul in decades. The largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse.",
      "Trump campaigned on the economy - vowing to extend tax cuts, further slash corporate taxes, and eliminate tax on tips, overtime pay and Social Security income.",
      "How Congress gets it done - an extension of the 2017 bill, a combination of old and new legislation or by other means -  is up in the air.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 01:01:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Territory is home to over 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, but not everyone wants them there.",
    "story": [
      "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",
      "Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.",
      "'Hero' father killed in crocodile attack",
      "Body found in search for child missing in croc attack",
      "This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.",
      "Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.",
      "His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.",
      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",
      "Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.",
      "\"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,\" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.",
      "\"The bit I don't have to tell you\u2026 [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.\"",
      "For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.",
      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",
      "\"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,\" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.",
      "He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.",
      "\"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator\u2026and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.",

      "A man accused of long hiding a stolen pair of sequined ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \"The Wizard of Oz\" plans to plead guilty, his attorney confirmed Friday.",
      "The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in Minneapolis in 2018.",

      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, now 77, of Crystal, Minnesota, was charged last March with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering.",
      "He's expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned Monday before a federal magistrate judge, a formality because magistrate judges can't accept guilty pleas in felony cases in Minnesota. But the district judge overseeing the case on Friday scheduled a change of plea hearing for Jan. 10.",
      "Saliterman's attorney, John C. Brink, confirmed to The Associated Press that his client will change his plea then to guilty, but he declined to give details about any potential plea agreement. The U.S. Attorney's Office for North Dakota, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, now 77, pleaded guilty in 2023 to theft of a major artwork, admitting to what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \"one last score\" after turning from a life of crime. The 76-year-old Grand Rapids man was sentenced to time served, one year of supervised release and $23,000 in restitution to the museum.",
      "The indictment against Saliterman says that from August 2005 to July 2018, he \"received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage.\" Saliterman, according to the indictment, knew they were stolen, and that he threatened to release a sex tape of a woman and \"take her down with him\" if she did keep her mouth shut about the slippers.",
      "Saliterman is also in poor health. He was in a wheelchair and on supplemental oxygen last March during his first court appearance.",
      "Authorities have not said how Martin and Saliterman might have been connected. Martin, who lives near Grand Rapids, said at his plea hearing in October 2023 that he hoped to sell what he thought were real rubies from the shoes. But a person who deals in stolen goods, known as a fence, informed him the rubies weren't real, he said. Martin said he then got rid of the slippers, but declined to say how he did so.",
      "Garland's character, Dorothy, wore several pairs while filming the classic 1939 musical, but only four pairs are known to remain. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Martin stole them. Shaw eventually got them back, and had them auctioned last month.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2026?",
      "2026 will be another exciting year for the public domain with works from 1930 losing their copyright. Protection will run out for the earliest versions of Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse's dog Pluto and his friend Clarabelle Cow, teen detective Nancy Drew, M.C.

      "An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs.",
      "A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison \u2014 a form of pre-trial detention \u2014 was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October.",
      "The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge.",
      "The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison.",
      "The hotel manager and hotel reception manager who were charged saw Payne intoxicated and unable to stand in the hotel lobby prior to his death, according to a\u00a0news release from the prosecutor's office. Authorities said the manager permitted Payne to be taken up to his room, which had a balcony, and the reception manager helped bring him up to his room, instead of keeping him in a place without sources of danger and with company until medical help could arrive.",
      "In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" in the moments before his death.",
      "Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "Will the pressure of hosting the Globes get to Glaser? She says she hopes it does. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",
      "Glaser's \"system,\" which she first developed for the Brady roast, is working with a team of writers that includes Sean O'Conner, Jessica Dweck, and Glaser's longtime boyfriend and collaborator, Chris Convy.",
      "Those jokes they come up are then tested over and over, both on the road and in small L.A. clubs, to see what real audiences think.",
      "\"I did have a bunch of Ozempic jokes that I was gonna tell, but I lost them. The natural way, I swear! I just cut out soda.\"",
      "The Golden Globes audience will decide on January 5th if all this preparation by Glaser has paid off. But she says, in a certain way, she's already working on her next project, an off-stage one at that.",
      "\"I think my new challenge is, I wanna be known for being a nice celebrity,\" Glaser said. \"I just wanna be someone that people go, 'Oh, she's really great to work with. She was really nice to us,' and not in an inauthentic way.\"",
      "\"You wanna spread kindness to people while you're eviscerating their entire existence in your periphery?\" I asked.",
      "\"That's the paradox of it,\" she said. \"I wanna spread honesty.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Several Western states are seeing rates worse than last year's peak of flu season.",
    "story": [
      "Emergency room visits with influenza are now \"very high\" nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, in this week's update on the winter respiratory virus season.",
      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",
      "In the Midwest, Indiana ranks as the state with the largest share of emergency room visits with COVID-19, though they remain a fraction of influenza visits and below last winter's peak.",

      "\"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is advising residents to not feed their pets Monarch Raw Pet Food sold at several farmers markets in California,\" the agency said, noting that an L.A. county house cat that was fed the product had been confirmed to have the virus. Four other cats from the same home were \"presumed to have also been positive for H5 bird flu after consuming the product.\"",
      "The health department urged residents who fed their pets the Monarch raw food products or any other raw meat or dairy items and noticed their animal exhibiting any unusual behavior to immediately contact their veterinarian.",

      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",

      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. When the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.",
      "Top vet warns against raw food for pets",
      "Oregon health officials traced the cat's illness to the frozen Northwest Naturals cat food that contained raw turkey. Virus recovered from the recalled pet food and the infected cat matched.",
      "Some pet owners feed their animals raw meat, but that can be dangerous, even fatal for the animals, said Dr. Michael Q. Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cooking meat or pasteurizing raw milk destroys the bird flu virus and other disease-causing germs.",

Even before the cattle outbreak, there were feline cases linked to wild birds or poultry. Since March, dozens of cats have caught the virus. These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat, Bailey said, and pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",
      "Don't let them wander freely in the outdoors, he said, \"because you don't know what they're getting into. Cats are natural hunters, and one of the animals they love to hunt are birds.\"",

      "If your cat is usually playful and likes to look out the window, but instead has been sleeping all the time or hiding from you, take note, Bailey said. \"There's something wrong,\" he said.",

      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

    "summary": "Legislation granting full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million retirees will soon get become law, advocates say.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Monday is expected to sign into law legislation extending full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million U.S. retirees, according to advocates for the measure.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress.",
      "Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to\u00a0hold\u00a0a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change.",
      "Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate the reduction of Social Security benefits while entitled to public pensions from work not covered by Social Security,\" the Social Security Administration stated in an\u00a0update\u00a0Thursday. \"The Social Security Administration is evaluating how to implement the Act if signed into law. We will provide more information as soon as available.\"",
      "Americans who previously filed for Social Security benefits that are partially or completely offset do not need to take any action other than to verify that the Social Security Administration has their current mailing address and direct deposit information.",
      "\"Most people can do this online with their personal my Social Security account without calling or visiting Social Security. Visit\u00a0www.ssa.gov/myaccount\u00a0to sign in or create your account,\" the agency advised.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration's move on Friday to\u00a0block Nippon Steel's proposed purchase\u00a0of U.S. Steel raises questions about the once iconic American company's future, with industry sources saying the manufacturer could struggle to energize growth or attract rival acquisition bids.",
      "President Biden stopped the $15 billion deal over national security and supply-chain concerns.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt blasted the decision, calling Mr. Biden's action \"shameful\" and \"corrupt\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk,\" Burritt said.",
      "Burritt added that the proposed deal \"is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities and our country.\"",

      "\"With foreign ownership seemingly off the table, we see limited avenues moving forward,\" Bill Peterson, metals and mining analyst for JPMorgan said in a research note.",
      "U.S. Steel leaders had warned that without an infusion of capital from Nippon Steel, it would be forced to curtail its legacy blast furnace investments and shift to cheaper nonunion electric arc furnaces. Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "The company could still entertain bids from domestic rivals, said Peterson, noting that U.S. Steel's mini-mill assets could be attractive to peers like steel products company Nucor Group, which considered buying parts of U.S. Steel before dropping out over price concerns.",
      "Others see rival bids as unlikely.",
      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",
      "Challenges from both sides",
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",

      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California.

    "summary": "JetBlue is the first carrier to be penalized by the Department of Transportation for unrealistic scheduling practice.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Friday announced a $2 million fine against JetBlue for \"operating multiple chronically delayed flights,\" marking the first such penalty by the federal agency.",
      "Airlines are prohibited from offering unrealistic schedules that don't reflect actual flight departure and arrival times, yet an investigation by the DOT found that JetBlue operated four chronically delayed flights at least 145 times between June 2022 through November 2023, according to the DOT.",
      "Each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months or more. Despite DOT warning JetBlue about inaccurate flight departure and arrival times on its flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, the airline continued to operate three more repeatedly delayed flights between Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida and JFK; and between Fort Lauderdale and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the agency said.",
      "There were 395 delays and cancellations across these four chronically delayed flights in total, and the DOT's investigation found\u00a0 JetBlue responsible for more than 70% of its chronically delayed flights.",
      "JetBlue said it had invested tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays over the past two years, and had seen significant improvements in 2024.",
      "\"While we've reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four flights in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation's air traffic control system,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Consumers advocates applauded the government's move to penalize JetBlue.",
      "\"Airlines often don't allow enough time between flights and they often allow for no margin for error,\" Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said in a statement. \"They often treat travelers like seat numbers, not people who have lives and commitments and plans for everything from vacations to weddings or funerals.\"",
      "What counts as a chronic delay?",
      "The agency has ongoing investigations into other airlines for unrealistic flight schedules that do not reflect actual departure and arrival times. A flight is considered chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50% of the time, with cancellations included as delays, it stated.",
      "The penalty comes as the Biden administration winds down, leaving uncertain how the incoming Trump regime will tackle transportation issues. Under Biden, transportation regulators have taken a series of actions to safeguard airline passengers, including passing rules that now provide automatic refunds when flights are significantly delayed or canceled.",
      "\"Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",

      "JetBlue must pay half the penalty in cash to the U.S. Treasury, with the other $1 million going to compensate JetBlue passengers harmed by the delayed flights or any future disruptions caused by JetBlue within the next year. The future compensation must be a minimum of $75 for each affected passenger.",
      "JetBlue had one of the poorest on-time performances last year among the U.S. airlines, according to a ranking by Cirium. The aviation analytics firm found that less than 75% of JetBlue's flights arrived on schedule, putting the airline behind all the major domestic carriers, including some of its low-cost rivals.

Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "Turo CEO Andre Haddad released a statement on Friday detailing the company's ongoing cooperation with authorities. \"We've spent these tense, mournful hours investigating, partnering with law enforcement, and working around the clock to figure out how our platform could be misused by the perpetrators of such atrocities,\" the CEO said.",
      "According to the 12-year-old company, out of its entire history of rentals \u2014 which includes 27 million bookings spanning 8.6 billion miles driven \u2014 less than .10% have ended in a \"serious incident, such as a vehicle theft.\"",

      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments.

      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",

      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",

Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",

    "title": "Where are mortgage, CD and credit card rates heading in 2025?",
    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed has been pushing down borrowing cuts since September, yet mortgage rates remain close to 7%. Here's what to expect in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Americans started to see some financial relief in 2024 as cooling inflation led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times after jacking up borrowing costs to their highest level in 23 years in a bid to hose down red-hot prices.",
      "The Fed's policy shift raises questions about what 2025 might bring for borrowers, especially on the home-buying front, where mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high despite the rate cuts. On Jan. 2, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage inched up to 6.91%, its highest point in almost six months, Freddie Mac said\u00a0on Monday.",
      "Complicating the financial picture are President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans. Those could include\u00a0sweeping new tariffs\u00a0on foreign goods and more tax cuts, policies economists warn could reignite inflation. If that occurs, the Fed could be hard-pressed to continue its rate-cutting push.",
      "To be sure, Trump may be using the threat of aggressive new tariffs chiefly as a bargaining tactic to win better trading terms from other nations, while inflation may continue to drift lower this year, giving the Fed room to continue cutting rates. For now, however, uncertainty over Trump's policies and their potential impact on the economy, according to Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, leaves unanswered questions for investors and consumers.",
      "\"For much of the past year, investors have viewed rate cuts as a key ingredient that would take pressure off struggling portions of the economy and lead to a broadening of the market,\" he noted, in a research note last month.",
      "Read on about to see what financial experts predict for interest rates for 2025.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates again in 2025?",
      "Most economists think the Fed will continue to cut rates this year, although many have pared their forecasts for the number of cuts given stickier-than-expected inflation in the second half of 2024.",
      "At its December policy meeting, the Fed\u00a0projected that it will loosen rates less next year than it had previously expected. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September.",
      "Some economists are projecting three rate cuts this year, including Goldman Sachs, whose economists expect rates to end 2025 in the range of 3.5% to 3.75%, down from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Economists are currently split on whether the Fed will again lower its benchmark rate at its January 28-29 meeting.",
      "\"Stubborn inflation and economic growth that has surprised to the upside in 2024 will give way to stubborn inflation and slower, still solid economic growth in 2025,\" Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride predicted in an email.",
      "Will mortgage rates drop in 2025?",
      "Mortgage rates around the U.S. have remained high despite the Fed's three rate cuts, which have lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "Despite that step-down, mortgage costs haven't seen a commensurate decline. The typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in January 2024, when it stood at about 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac data.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't dipped along with the Fed's cuts because they're based on several factors besides the central bank's benchmark rate. Those issues include the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, and experts now say home buyers might not see significant relief in 2025.",
      "\"Continued economic growth and worries about inflation and government debt will keep mortgage rates elevated,\" McBride wrote.",
      "Mortgage rates could end 2025 at 6.5%, he predicted.",
      "That jibes with a forecast from Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, who told CBS MoneyWatch in November that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is likely to hover around 6.5% for much of 2025, although rates might bounce around between 6% and 7% over the course of the year.",
      "Will credit card rates fall in 2025?",
      "Credit card rates will likely decline along with additional Fed cuts in 2025, but people with revolving balances are still going to be paying high fees. It could also take up to three months for rate cuts to result in lower card APRs, McBride noted.",
      "He expects the typical credit card to charge about 19.8% by the end of 2025. Currently, the average APR for new card offers is about 24.4%, according to LendingTree.",
      "How will rates on CDs and savings account change in 2025?",
      "One bright spot during the Fed's regime of interest-rate hikes was that it boosted returns for savers, who could earn healthy returns on their money held in savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts.",
      "Rates for these products will likely decrease if the Fed makes additional rate cuts in 2025, as they did after the central bank cut rates in late 2024. But shopping around could help savers find better deals, McBride said.",
      "For instance, he predicted the national average for savings accounts will be 0.35% at the end of 2025, but top-yielding offers could stand at 3.8% by year-end. Top-yielding 1-year CDs could pay about 3.7%, while five-year CDs may pay 3.95% by the end of 2025, McBride forecast.",

    "summary": "The explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas on New Year's Day is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "A Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early Wednesday, killing one person, in an incident that is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, according to law enforcement.",
      "Investigators do not believe there's \"any other danger to the community right now,\" FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz said at a news conference Wednesday evening.",
      "The sole person inside the vehicle died, and seven people suffered minor injuries, Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. He called the explosion \"an isolated incident\" and said there is no indication that it was linked to ISIS.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the Cybertruck was rented to Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, an active duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant, who was serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident.",
      "Las Vegas Police said the Clark County Coroner confirmed Thursday that Livelsberger had been identified as the driver of the vehicle in the explosion. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner's office said.",
      "At a briefing earlier Thursday, the FBI said their investigation determined the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated, and a gun was found at his feet.",
      "They said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation, but needed a dental or DNA match for identification since the body was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "According to CBS News' conversations with his father, Livelsberger was based at Fort Carson but had been serving in Germany. His father said he works with drones. He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials said Thursday there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "A short time after the Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",
      "In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said: \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "In the past year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become a major donor and close adviser to Trump, with the billionaire\u00a0tasked to head up\u00a0Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk, along with his co-leader of DOGE, Vivek Ramaswamy, are aiming to cut billions in federal spending.",
      "\"[O]bviously a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel \u2014 there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward with that,\" McMahill said.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a post on X, Musk said \"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.   Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.  We've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "In another post a few hours later, he said the blast \"was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.\"",
      "Evacuation at Trump Las Vegas hotel",
      "A county spokeswoman said in a statement that the fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m. Details about the incident were initially sketchy.",
      "\"I know you have a lot of questions,\" Jeremy Schwartz, acting FBI Special Agent in Charge for the Las Vegas office, said at the news conference. \"We don't have a lot of answers.\"",
      "Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons, posted about the fire on X,\u00a0saying\u00a0that an \"electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte coch\u00e8re of Trump Las Vegas.\"",

      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",

    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, which closed many businesses and forced government agencies to limit their hours. But Luma noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground power line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria, chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",
      "Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations, calling them an effort to \"smear\" China's reputation.",
      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.",

      "You may think you have a pretty good idea of the world map, but Atossa Araxia Abrahamian explains how special economic zones, tax havens, and free ports are carving up the planet for the highest bidders \u2013 and leaving millions of people worse off.",
      "\"The Hidden Globe: How Wealth Hacks the World\" (Riverhead Books) makes a complex financial and legal subject clear, exciting \u2026 and deeply troubling.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"The Hidden Globe\" by Atossa Araxia Abrahamian",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

    "title": "Biden awards Medal of Honor to 7 veterans of Vietnam and Korean Wars",
    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 19:02:01 -0500",
    "summary": "One recipient, Kenneth W. David, attended the White House ceremony, while the others honored posthumously with the award were represented by family members.",
    "story": [
      "Richard Cavazos' name is already recognized across the U.S. Army. He forged a path through service in Korea and Vietnam to become the first Hispanic four-star general, leading to a legacy that included the renaming of Texas' Fort Hood for him. It's now Fort Cavazos.",
      "But on Friday, he finally received the nation's highest military award, the Medal of Honor.",
      "Cavazos, who died in 2017, earned the award for actions during the Korean War in 1953, when the young first lieutenant led his company through multiple rounds of assaults to destroy an enemy outpost \u2014 all while facing heavy fire. After his company was ordered to pull back, Cavazos returned alone several times to rescue missing soldiers, even though he had also been wounded.",
      "Cavazos, along with six other veterans, received the Medal of Honor for their actions in Korea or in Vietnam.",
      "President Biden awarded the seven medals during a ceremony at the White House Friday, noting, \"These are my final days as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "\"It's been the greatest honor of my life to be entrusted with the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, the finest military in the history of the world,\" Mr. Biden said, as he expressed gratitude for the veterans' \"integrity, their patriotism and their courage.\"",
      "\"They \"not only fought for our nation, but ... embody the very best our nation has to offer,\" the president added.",
      "One of the recipients, Kenneth W. David, who earned the honor for heroism in Vietnam, received the award in person, while the families of the other deceased recipients accepted the award in their honor.",
      "Some of the families worked for decades for the recognition. Cpl. Fred B. McGee's daughter, Victoria Secrest, had advocated for him to receive the award since the early 1990s.",
      "\"The odds are against you, and I started to look like the crazy lady with the clipboard everywhere I went. And then with the computer, the laptop everywhere I went. And then with the iPad everywhere I went. And here we are in 2024, about to step into 2025, and we've made it.\" Secrest told reporters at a media roundtable late last month.",
      "McGee received the award posthumously for commanding his squad unit in Korea after its leader and several others were wounded during an assault on an enemy post. He eventually had to order his unit to withdraw, but he voluntarily stayed behind to evacuate the wounded and dead, despite facial wounds he sustained.",
      "In the 1950s, McGee received an unusual form of recognition for his heroism. He was honored in a comic book, but there was an error.\u00a0 \"They forgot his melanin,\" Secrest said. The comic portrayed McGee as White, even though he was Black.",
      "Others have been honored in their home communities. A statue of PFC Charles Johnson at the high school he attended in Arlington County in New York depicts him saving Donald Dingee, a fellow Arlington High School classmate. Johnson was killed in action in Korea while saving the lives of as many as 10 wounded soldiers, including Dingee.",
      "Johnson posthumously received the Medal of Honor for the actions he took in June 1953.",
      "Although the honors are about 70 years in the making, it's clear these veterans had an immediate impact on their communities.",
      "Charles Allen, the nephew of Medal of Honor recipient Pvt. Bruno R. Orig, during the media roundtable told Richard E. Cavazos' son Tommy that his father \"is indeed a hero.\"",
      "\"I did get a chance to meet your father.\" Allen told Cavazos. \"He was already a retired four-star (general). He was a mentor, senior mentor, 'Gray Beard,' as we affectionately called him\u2026 And when he spoke, everyone listened, everyone listened, and he impressed me then.\"",
      "Allen's uncle received the award for actions he took near Chipyong-ni, Korea on Feb. 15, 1951, to administer first aid while under attack and firing at the enemy while Orig's platoon safely withdrew.",
      "Capt. Hugh R. Nelson Jr., who served in the Vietnam War, was the commander of a Huey helicopter conducting a search-and-destroy reconnaissance mission in June 1966 when it was struck by a large volume of enemy fire. Nelson and the pilot were able to crash land the helicopter and then Nelson helped evacuate the other wounded members of the crew from the helicopter. He used his body as a shield to cover one of his crew members from intense enemy fire, sacrificing his own life to save them.",
      "And finally, PFC Wataru Nakamura received the Medal of Honor for actions he took near P'ungch'on-ni, Korea on May 18, 1951, when he alone rushed enemy forces with a fixed bayonet and drove the enemy from several bunkers they had captured. He withdrew to restock on ammunition then continued to charge at the enemy, killing four in two bunkers. He was killed by an enemy grenade.",
      "Nakamura's nephew, Gary Takashima thinks that his uncle, if he were alive, would react to receiving the award with humility. Takashima told reporters his uncle \"would have been greatly honored to receive the Medal of Honor but would have felt all of this was too much for doing what he was supposed to do.\"",

    "summary": "Legislation granting full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million retirees will soon get become law, advocates say.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Monday is expected to sign into law legislation extending full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million U.S. retirees, according to advocates for the measure.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress.",
      "Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to\u00a0hold\u00a0a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change.",
      "Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate the reduction of Social Security benefits while entitled to public pensions from work not covered by Social Security,\" the Social Security Administration stated in an\u00a0update\u00a0Thursday. \"The Social Security Administration is evaluating how to implement the Act if signed into law. We will provide more information as soon as available.\"",
      "Americans who previously filed for Social Security benefits that are partially or completely offset do not need to take any action other than to verify that the Social Security Administration has their current mailing address and direct deposit information.",
      "\"Most people can do this online with their personal my Social Security account without calling or visiting Social Security. Visit\u00a0www.ssa.gov/myaccount\u00a0to sign in or create your account,\" the agency advised.",

    "story": [
      "Before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House he will return to the courthouse, a New York judge ruled Friday.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan will sentence Trump for his crimes on Jan. 10 \u2014 just 10 days before his inauguration on Jan. 20 \u2014 in a court proceeding that will be unlike any in America's 248 years. Trump's conviction in New York\u00a0stemmed from a\u00a0$130,000 so-called \"hush money\" payment\u00a0his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan's ruling ends two months of speculation \u2014 and back and forth jockeying by Trump's attorneys and prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u2014 following Trump's narrow election victory on Nov. 5.",
      "Trump became the first former president ever convicted of crimes in May, when a unanimous jury found him guilty in the New York case. Sentencing in the case was stalled for months as Trump campaigned for a return to the presidency. In November, he became the first person voted into the White House after a criminal conviction.",
      "The president-elect had argued in a motion to dismiss that his ascension to the White House mandated his conviction be vacated. Merchan said Friday that it did not.",
      "\"This court finds that neither the vacatur of the jury's verdicts nor dismissal of the indictment are required by the Presidential immunity doctrine, the Presidential Transition Act or the Supremacy Clause,\" Merchan wrote in his order Friday.",
      "Merchan indicated in his ruling that Trump will not be sentenced to serve time behind bars. He wrote that prosecutors agree with this decision. He also said that Trump may appear virtually, rather than in person for the sentencing.",
      "\"It seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the (prosecutors) concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Trump's lawyers claimed the constitutional demands on a president-elect \"superseded\" the jury's decision and ongoing proceedings in the case.",
      "Bragg's office argued that the judge had a range of options, including \"novel\" ones to balance the interests of justice with the unprecedented circumstance of a convicted defendant being elected to the presidency before sentencing. Their suggestions included postponing proceedings until after Trump's term in office, and even terminating the case and its proceedings with a note that the verdict had not been set aside.",
      "Merchan said Trump's own motion to dismiss acknowledged that a president-elect is not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, the transition period between election and the taking of the presidential oath is one filled with enormous responsibility,\" Merchan wrote. \"Yet, even (the) defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",
      "Trump's conviction carried with it the potential for up to four years in jail, but also a wide range of alternatives to incarceration, including probation and fines.",
      "Merchan said in his ruling that after Trump's victory, his attorneys' rhetoric changed from \"spirited\" to \"dangerously close to crossing the line.\"",
      "\"Counsel has resorted to language, indeed rhetoric, that has no place in legal pleadings. For example, countless times in their motion to dismiss, counsel accuses the prosecution and this court of engaging in 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional' conduct,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan cited a recent report by the Supreme Court's chief justice that warned about elected leaders undermining the judiciary",
      "\"Viewed in full context and mindful of the parties to this action, such arguments, in the broader picture, have the potential to create a chilling effect on the third branch of government,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Despite Merchan's excoriation, Trump communications director Steven Cheung did not hold back in a statement on the ruling. He called the case a \"witch hunt\" and Merchan \"deeply conflicted.\"",
      "\"This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\" Cheung said.",
      "Merchan's decision is the latest in a string of historical firsts set by the case. Trump's indictment in March 2023 made him the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally charged. He was subject to a seven-week trial this spring, which took place during the Republican presidential primaries.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Trump grumbled quietly, but often leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed as prosecutors and lawyers questioned more than 20 witnesses. At times his head drooped down, as he apparently dozed off. In the hallway just outside the courtroom \u2014 surrounded by a rotating posse of Republican allies, lawyers and Secret Service agents \u2014 Trump seethed about the case while campaigning to a gaggle of press cameras.",
      "At times, his dual commitments to the court and the cameras caused trouble. Merchan held Trump in contempt 10 times for violating a gag order prohibiting public statements about potential jurors, witnesses and others.",
      "Witnesses, beginning with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, described two schemes at the core of the case. The first was a plan hatched by Trump, Pecker and former attorney Michael Cohen to \"catch\" stories or allegations that might hurt Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy and \"kill\" them by paying people in exchange for nondisclosure agreements. Pecker and others described three such arrangements, known as \"hush money\" payments.",
      "Days before the election, Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2014 also a witness in the trial \u2014 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. He and another witness described Trump's relief that voters didn't learn of the story before the election.",
      "Cohen also described an arrangement in which he was covertly reimbursed for the payment to Daniels. The jury concluded Trump, while president in 2017, authorized a scheme to falsify business records in order to conceal Cohen's repayment. That scheme ultimately included 34 falsified records connected to monthly installments portrayed as payments for ongoing legal services, when they were in fact Cohen's reimbursements for the Daniels payoff.",
      "The jury took less than two days to reach its verdict. Trump, who had frequently stared at the jury of his peers during the trial, would not make eye contact with them as his sentence was pronounced.",
      "He looked straight ahead as the jury's foreperson pronounced Trump guilty 34 times, and as Merchan thanked the jury for their service before allowing them to file out of the room.",
      "After Merchan himself stepped out, Trump rose, frowning deeply, and briefly grasped his son Eric's hand.",
      "Trump led his entourage out of the courtroom, huddled for a moment with his lawyers, and then turned to address the cameras awaiting his reaction.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:52:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A government panel failed to reach consensus on national security risks of a proposal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency. The U.S., he said, needs domestic companies that represent the majority of the nation's steelmaking capacity to \"keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests.\"",
      "Mr. Biden\u00a0long opposed the deal\u00a0and was waiting for a report on the merger to be issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to announce his final decision. The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",
      "\"This action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as president to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security,\" the president's statement said.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel condemned the decision and said in a joint statement they would take \"all appropriate action\" to protect their legal rights. The companies called Mr. Biden's move \"unlawful.\"",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U. S. Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt called Mr. Biden's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Before Mr. Biden announced his decision,\u00a0U.S. Steel\u00a0had indicated it was likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocked the acquisition, sources familiar with the process said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union said it doubted Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order expanding the factors that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States should consider when reviewing deals, such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or whether it would put Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:59:33 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the first priorities for Senate Majority Leader John Thune is the confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump's expected nominees.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Friday that he doesn't believe there is \"clarity\" yet on whether all 53 Republican senators will support President-elect Donald Trump's picks for his second administration.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Thune, who took charge of the Senate on Friday with the start of the 119th Congress, was asked whether he knows some of his GOP colleagues will vote against confirming Pete Hegseth for defense secretary or Kash Patel for director of the FBI.",
      "\"We don't have, at this point I don't think, clarity on that,\" Thune said. \"I think these are nominees who are new enough, they've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone very well, but they still have to make their case in front of the committee. And, you know, we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process, and that's what we've committed to and promised and and I expect to deliver on.\"",
      "Thune noted that Republicans have a three-vote margin in the Senate and said each individual senator will decide how to vote on Trump's picks.",
      "\"I do think that in most cases, at least most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the president the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for a vote,\" he said.",
      "Still, Thune predicted that \"a lot of them will get through, and we'll see about all of them.\"",
      "\"I think that's why we have the process, and we will adhere to that process and give all of these nominees an opportunity to make their case,\" he said.",
      "Thune is taking over as the Senate majority leader and head of the chamber's Republican conference, a position he secured in November following the general election. The South Dakota senator succeeds Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, at the helm of the GOP.",
      "With the 119th Congress officially underway, one of Thune's first tasks as majority leader will be overseeing the confirmation process for Trump's expected nominees to key government positions. Some of the president-elect's picks, such as Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, are expected to easily win Senate approval.",
      "But others, like Hegseth and Patel, face a less clear path. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who served as a Democrat in the House, is also expected to come under close scrutiny by senators as they consider whether to confirm her for director of national intelligence, as is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill last month working to shore up support from Republican senators following accusations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement of veterans' charities and excessive drinking. Hegseth, a former Fox New host and Army veteran, has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Patel, meanwhile, is a Trump ally whose selection to lead the FBI has raised concerns that he would weaponize the agency to target the president-elect's opponents. Gabbard does not have experience in the field of intelligence and has faced criticism for her positions on Russia's war with Ukraine and U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war.",
      "Kennedy is likely to face questions about his past claims about vaccines and statements about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "Patel, Gabbard and Kennedy were also on Capitol Hill meeting privately with senators before the holidays.",
      "Most of the Senate committees that will conduct confirmation hearings for Trump's expected nominees have not yet set dates for the proceedings. Hegseth is set to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing Jan. 14, chairman Roger Wicker announced last month. FBI background checks could also slow down the process.",
      "Background checks are typically only shared with committee leaders and not the full panel, but some Republicans and Democrats have been pushing for access for the FBI's report on Hegseth, according to Politico.",
      "Asked whether he would encourage access to those background checks for senators, Thune said \"sure,\" adding, \"I think that you want to have as much background as possible that is available to the committees as they make their decisions.\"",
      "But the president-elect has urged the GOP-led chamber to move swiftly, especially following the New Year's Day terrorist attack in New Orleans that left at least 14 people dead.",
      "Thune, too, said earlier this week that the rampage on Bourbon Street underscores the need for the Senate to act quickly to confirm Trump's nominees.",
      "\"The threat posed by ISIS will outlast this administration, and this is a clear example of why the Senate must get President Trump's national security team in place as quickly as possible,\" he wrote on X.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday, following the terrorist attack on Bourbon Street on New Year's Day that left at least 14 dead and dozens more injured.",
      "The White House said the president and first lady \"will grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack on January 1 and meet with officials on the ground.\"",
      "During a White House event honoring acts of valor by public safety officers, the president told reporters that he has spoken with families of the New Orleans victims.",
      "Federal authorities said a driver, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, plowed a truck into people celebrating New Year's Eve on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. The attacker was shot and killed by police after exchanging gunfire with three officers who responded, according to the FBI. Jabbar was a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas and had served in the U.S. Army, an Army spokesperson confirmed.",
      "The FBI said Thursday that the attacker posted videos declaring support for ISIS before the massacre, and investigators do not believe Jabbar had accomplices.",
      "Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said that Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck through a peer-to-peer rental app called Turo and picked the vehicle up in Houston on Dec. 30. He drove to New Orleans the following day and during the drive, posted five videos to his Facebook account, Raia said.",
      "In the videos, the attacker proclaimed support for ISIS and said he had joined the terror group over the summer, according to the FBI. While the investigation into Jabbar's motive is ongoing, Raia said the driver was \"100% inspired by ISIS.\"",
      "FBI bomb technicians also recovered two improvised explosive devices in coolers, Raia said. During remarks Thursday, Mr. Biden said federal investigators determined Jabbar planted the explosives at two locations in the French Quarter before the attack and also had a remote detonator in his truck. Investigators also recovered three phones and two laptops linked to Jabbar, Raia said.",
      "Since the attack early on New Year's Day, Mr. Biden has convened meetings with his Homeland Security team and said Thursday that he has made all resources available for the investigation.",
      "\"The people of New Orleans are sending an unmistakable message: They will not let this attack or the attacker's deluded ideology overcome us. None of us should fear it,\" he said from the White House. \"And we're going to relentlessly pursue ISIS and other terrorist organizations where they are, and they'll find no safe harbor here.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019.",
      "Still, there's the potential for sparks to fly in the House if Republicans revolt against Speaker Mike Johnson during the leadership vote, which is expected to take place shortly after 12 p.m.",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will officially take the reins after flipping the majority in the November elections.",
      "Here's what to know as the new Congress convenes in Washington:",
      "When do the new members of Congress get sworn in?",
      "The new term of Congress, which lasts two years, begins Friday, when House members are expected to be sworn in. But first, they'll have to elect a speaker, which has not come easy for a divided Republican Party in the last two elections to pick their leader.",
      "It took former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, 15 rounds to win the gavel in 2023, delaying the swearing-in of new members by several days. McCarthy was ousted months later, and it took Republicans three weeks to coalesce behind Johnson. The Louisiana Republican is hoping to continue as speaker, but is facing some opposition within his own party after another messy fight last month over government funding.",
      "The Senate swears in members when it convenes Friday and then moves on to other business.",
      "How does the speaker's election work?",
      "Typically, a member from each party will nominate a candidate for speaker ahead of a vote of all incoming members on the House floor. Those candidates were determined in November, when both parties separately decided who they would support for leadership.",
      "Johnson won the backing of Republicans for another term. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, will be nominated by his party. Members are not required to vote for those candidates and could choose to support someone else or no one.",
      "During the roll call vote, members will state aloud who they favor for speaker. The candidate with the majority of votes cast wins the speakership. If no candidate wins on the first round, the vote is repeated until someone secures the majority.",
      "What is the new balance of power in the House and the Senate?",
      "Republicans flipped control of the Senate in the November elections and will have 53 seats. Democrats, including independents who caucus with them, will control 47.",
      "In the House, Republicans held on to their majority, winning 220 seats. Democrats won 215. But President-elect Donald Trump has tapped two Republican members for positions in his administration, cutting into the party's already narrow margins until special elections are held in the coming months. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has also said he would not take his seat, giving Republicans a 219 to 215 edge.",
      "Johnson will need 218 votes to win the speaker's election if all members are present and voting.",
      "What do Republicans want to accomplish first?",
      "Republicans' top priorities include immigration and border security, energy policy and extending tax cuts from Trump's first term. But whether Republicans can quickly accomplish their goals depends on how unified the party is. They plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which would give them the ability to pass large portions of their agenda with a simple majority, avoiding the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of work to build a consensus among all the Republicans to get it done,\" Johnson told Fox News on Monday.",
      "Trump has also called for the debt ceiling to be increased, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills. Without an increase, it's likely to complicate Republicans' legislative priorities.",

      "The president has said in the past he opposed the deal, saying it was vital for U.S. Steel \"to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In recent days, Mr. Biden's top advisers have had extensive discussions with him about whether or not to approve the deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also spoken directly with the president about the matter.",
      "U.S. Steel has indicated it is likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocks the acquisition, sources said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS, intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "An earlier proposal suggested an independent majority-American board appointed by CFIUS would make decisions about production. That proposal was submitted to the White House for Mr. Biden's review on Monday.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "According to a source familiar with the process, Nippon Steel's new proposal offers a 10-year guarantee that it would not reduce production capacity at U.S. Steel's mills in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Texas, California and Arkansas without approval by a CFIUS panel, which is led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.",

    "summary": "With newfound control of both chambers of Congress, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, like immigration and taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A new Congress is kicking off on Friday as Republicans take control of the House and Senate ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House later this month. And with their newfound control of both chambers, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, notably immigration and taxes.",
      "How exactly Republicans will proceed remains to be seen. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson outlined plans to move the GOP agenda through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But reconciliation is a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included.",
      "Johnson, who faces his own dicey speaker's election on Friday, said a reconciliation package will be \"the key of the first 100 days,\" but he noted that it will require \"a lot of coordination, planning and executing those plans with precision.\"",
      "\"We are going to fix the border,\" Johnson said on Fox News on Monday. \"We are going to get the economy humming again. We are going to restore our stature on the world stage, get our energy policy fixed, make sure that we don't have the largest tax cut in U.S. history imposed upon the American people at the end of next year when the tax cuts from the Trump era expire.\"",
      "The first days of the new Congress will be marked by the speaker's election, which is required before the House moves on to other business, and the counting of the Electoral College votes on Monday, Jan. 6.",
      "Congressional Republicans have touted their alignment on the issues, saying that they have a mandate from the American people to deliver on Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Still, a unified vision of how to move forward with the priorities has appeared cloudy as the new Congress begins. And whether Republicans ultimately pursue one or two reconciliation bills remains a point of contention.",
      "\"We have a lot on our plate,\" Johnson said. \"But I'm confident we're going to be able to get it done.\"",
      "Here's where Republicans plan to start:",
      "Immigration",
      "Republicans have for months touted a plan, following Trump's lead, to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy. The pledge became a key part of the president-elect's campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures, including mass deportations.",
      "Many of the immigration proposals are expected to be implemented through executive orders. But Republican leaders in Congress have outlined plans to pursue parallel legislation that would surge resources to the southern border and continue construction of Trump's border wall, while working to bolster Border Patrol and technology at the border.",
      "On the timing of the legislation, Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, outlined that it \"makes sense for us to move quickly\" on immigration in an initial reconciliation package, paired with defense and energy provisions. This plan would leave economic measures such as addressing Trump's expiring 2017 tax cuts for a later date.",
      "\"I think we can do both,\" Thune said last month. \"We've got an opportunity to have a couple of different chances at a reconciliation package that would achieve all of those objectives.\"",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, said on Fox News in December that the plan is to put both a border security and tax package on a \"fast track,\" with a border package expected to reach Trump's desk by January or early February. Miller said it would mark the \"largest investment in immigration and border security\" in history.",
      "The leaders of the House Freedom Caucus have also weighed in, pushing in December for a standalone border package. The group of House conservatives argued in a letter to Johnson that it's \"imperative that we first send \u2014 in January \u2014 a focused and quick border reconciliation package that is fully offset.\"",
      "\"President Trump's agenda will be enacted, and border security must move first,\" the group wrote, adding that a larger reconciliation package focused on \"taxes, spending, energy, bureaucracy and more\" should come second.",
      "Taxes",
      "By year's end, key portions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire. Republicans want to extend them, or even make them permanent.",
      "Republicans are also aiming to build upon the tax cuts by strengthening existing provisions, including research and development costs that companies spend on innovation, and others that encourage domestic ownership of intellectual property. They may also pursue a child tax credit with work requirements, while addressing disagreements on state and local tax deductions.",
      "Johnson acknowledged last month that the tax piece \"can be very complicated,\" prompting discussion about where it fits into the timeline.",
      "The plan will rely on whether leadership can keep the House and Senate Republican conferences together. With 53 seats in the Senate, Republicans have room for just two defections under the budget reconciliation process. And in the House, with a likely 219-215 party breakdown, Republicans will also have little room for error \u2014 especially during the beginning of Trump's term, when three seats will be vacated by lawmakers leaving to serve in the executive branch.",
      "Meanwhile, House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith has advocated for one reconciliation package, arguing that pairing the tax provisions with the other policies would help it maneuver through the narrow House majority. Under either scenario, whether the party can stay together to pass the tax cut extensions, along with other key priorities, remains to be seen.",
      "Despite possessing a GOP trifecta when Trump entered office in 2017, Republicans fell short of a number of goals in the early days of the administration due to infighting and disorganization. And a more recent fight over the government funding process in December suggests the party may still struggle to remain unified going forward.",
      "Marc Short, a former legislative director under Trump, said on CNBC in December that the disagreement over government funding \"foreshadows how difficult it's going to be to pass any sort of extension of tax relief.\" And he argued that Trump made an unforced error when he brought the debt ceiling into the conversation \u2014 an issue that will be in play in the new Congress.",
      "Debt ceiling and government funding",
      "Trump called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills, during the government funding fight in December. And although lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, they couldn't agree on the last-minute request to address the debt ceiling. Democratic leaders called the fight premature, and fiscal conservatives opposed raising the debt ceiling without spending reforms.",
      "Though the debt ceiling isn't among Republicans' legislative priorities, it has major implications for the GOP's ability to advance its agenda.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders that the government will reach its borrowing limit sometime between Jan. 14 and 23. Once the limit is reached, the Treasury Department will implement so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to stave off a default on the government's debt. The department will then estimate an \"X date,\" the point at which the government will be unable to pay its obligations.",
      "In recent years, the debt limit has been used as a negotiating point in broader spending talks, dancing with a default that would have catastrophic implications for the global economy. Trump wanted the issue addressed before he takes office, imploring Republican lawmakers to suspend the debt ceiling or eliminate it entirely to deprive Democrats of leverage in upcoming spending fights under his watch.",
      "Johnson told reporters as the spending fight came to a close last month that he planned to address the debt ceiling in January, when congressional Republicans look to clear the way for their legislative priorities.",
      "Energy",
      "Republicans are also aiming to address energy policy in their budget reconciliation plans, pledging to \"unleash\" domestic energy production by mandating lease sales, opening federal lands for drilling, easing energy permitting regulations and rolling back energy provisions of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Whether lawmakers pursue other energy priorities, like clean energy tax credits, remains to be seen.",
      "The plan, billed as a way to increase the nation's energy independence, comes amid a broader campaign pitch from Republicans to cut costs, while clawing back Democrats' climate-centered policies.",
      "Approving Cabinet nominees and other top administration roles",
      "Trump has announced picks for dozens of Cabinet and top administration officials, many of whom will require Senate confirmation. While confirmation hearings can begin before Trump's inauguration, the formal voting process can't begin until Jan. 20, when the picks will become official nominations. The picks are then expected to monopolize the Senate's schedule.",
      "Thune has repeatedly pledged that Senate Republicans will work to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office. Trump has threatened to make unilateral appointments where he can if the process stalls.",
      "Still, a couple of Trump's picks, like his selection for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, have been controversial even among some Republicans, posing questions about their speedy confirmation.",

      "Las Vegas Police said the Clark County Coroner confirmed Thursday that Livelsberger had been identified as the driver of the vehicle in the explosion. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner's office said.",
      "At a briefing earlier Thursday, the FBI said their investigation determined the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated, and a gun was found at his feet.",
      "They said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation, but needed a dental or DNA match for identification since the body was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "According to CBS News' conversations with his father, Livelsberger was based at Fort Carson but had been serving in Germany. His father said he works with drones. He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials said Thursday there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "A short time after the Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",
      "In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said: \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",

      "\"[O]bviously a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel \u2014 there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward with that,\" McMahill said.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Rep. Bennie Thompson and former Rep. Liz Cheney, the two lawmakers who led the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Mr. Biden presented the awards to Thompson, Cheney and more than a dozen other recipients during a ceremony at the White House on Thursday.",
      "\"I've been honored to present law enforcement officers who defended our Capitol on Jan. 6, and the state and local election officials, elected leaders who defended the free and fair election of 2020,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Today we celebrate a new group of Americans who dedicated their careers to serving our democracy in other essential ways.\"",
      "The White House said Cheney received her award for \"putting the American people over party\" and Thompson received his for \"his lifelong dedication to safeguarding our Constitution.\" Both Thompson and Cheney received loud applause and standing ovations as they received their awards.",
      "\"The Presidential Citizens Medal is awarded to citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others. The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice,\" the White House said in announcing those honored.",
      "Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, served as chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House panel that was tasked with examining the events leading up to and on Jan. 6. In the course of its probe, the committee held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and compiled more than 1 million pages of material.",
      "Its work concluded in December 2022 after an investigation that spanned 18 months. The committee voted to refer President-elect Donald Trump and conservative lawyer John Eastman for criminal prosecution because of their alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6.",
      "Trump was charged with four federal criminal counts stemming from his efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 presidential election, but the charges were dismissed following a request by special counsel Jack Smith in November, after Trump was elected to a second term. The special counsel sought to end the prosecution because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "In its announcement of the recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal, the White House said that throughout Cheney's 20 years in public service, Cheney \"has raised her voice \u2014 and reached across the aisle\u2014to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency. Her integrity and intrepidness remind us all what is possible if we work together.\"",
      "Cheney became an ardent opponent of Trump following the 2020 election and endorsed Harris for president.",
      "The White House said of Thompson that he served \"at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth\" as chair of the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked Cheney, Thompson and the Jan. 6 committee since the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that they committed crimes and should go to jail. He told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in early December that he \"mostly likely\" will issue pardons to those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty for their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "Mr. Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of Trump from both parties to protect them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration, multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions told CBS News earlier this month. Among those who were under consideration are Cheney, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 select committee while in the House, and\u00a0retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist.\"",
      "In addition to Cheney and Thompson, Mr. Biden awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Mary Bonauto, an attorney who argued the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage; Bill Bradley, a former NBA player and U.S. senator; and Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a nurse during the Vietnam War and founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation.",
      "Former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Ted Kaufman of Delaware were also honored.",

And most importantly \u2014 I never thought I'd be saying this \u2014 they'll uphold the Constitution.\"",

      "The 235 judicial confirmations marks the largest number in a four-year term since the late President Jimmy Carter was in office and surpasses Trump's appointments to the federal bench by one. Carter did not appoint any justices to the Supreme Court, but selected a record 262 judges to the federal courts after Congress in 1978 passed legislation creating 35 new appeals court judgeships and 117 district court seats.",

      "The attack, which officials said left at least 14 people dead and injured dozens of others, is being investigated as an act of terrorism, the FBI said. Flying from the truck's rear bumper was a black ISIS flag. The FBI has identified Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old from Texas, as the man driving the vehicle. Jabbar had \"posted videos to social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill,\" President Biden said Wednesday.",

      "The FBI is leading the investigation, and Mr. Biden said in a statement that he has directed his administration to \"ensure every resource is available as federal, state, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Troy Carter, who represents the district and serves on the Homeland Security Committee, said on \"CBS Mornings\" that he believes New Orleans is secure, citing the FBI's assessment. He said the area has been swept and an exhaustive search has been conducted throughout the downtown area.",
      "\"There have been a number of leads that are being acted upon, and like any other terrorist event, you can never be too careful, so our caution is to make sure that we leave no stone unturned as it relates to the investigation,\" Carter said.",

Jeff Landry and Attorney General Merrick Garland, noting that \"there are many, many FBI agents that are on the ground that have been dispatched in New Orleans\" who are looking at \"every possible angle.\"",
      "\"We are trusting that that partnership between the federal and state authorities will bring us the answers that we need,\" Johnson added.",
      "Rep. Mike Waltz, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for his national security advisor, said on Fox News that intelligence indicators need to be examined. Although the attacker was born in the U.S., Waltz said that \"the entire world knows that we have an open border\" and \"they intend to hit us, and they are pushing people into our interior to do just that.\"",
      "Waltz said that if the U.S. is investigating \"internally at ourselves, we can't be defending ourselves abroad.\"",

      "Federal prosecutors are seeking to keep the man, Brad Spafford, in custody after his Dec. 17 arrest for allegedly possessing an unregistered short barrel rifle. While executing a search warrant at Spafford's 20-acre farm in the county of Isle of Wight, investigators found \"a stockpile of more than 150 homemade improvised explosive devices\" that were assessed to be pipe bombs, according to prosecutors. They said some of the pipe bombs were labeled \"lethal\" and \"preloaded into an apparent wearable vest.\"",
      "Most of the devices were allegedly found in a detached garage, while others were found in a backpack in a bedroom \"completely unsecured.\" Prosecutors said Spafford also \"acknowledged to keeping a jar in his freezer of HMTD, an explosive material that is so unstable it can be exploded merely as a result of friction of temperature changes.\" Investigators found the jar stored next to food items and labeled \"dangerous\" and \"do not touch,\" prosecutors said.",
      "According to court documents, which were first reported by the website\u00a0Court Watch, the investigation began in early 2023 after Spafford's neighbor told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and had lost three fingers on his right hand.",
      "\"Even after losing his own fingers as a result of his homemade explosive materials, he made the apparent remarkable decision to keep an extraordinarily dangerous explosive material in the home's freezer next to food items that could be accessed by the entire family,\" prosecutors said, arguing the man \"poses an extreme danger to the community\" and should remain in custody.",
      "The neighbor also told authorities that Spafford was using photos of President Biden for target practice at a local shooting range.

Initially, I had declined an invitation to attend the inauguration (since I don't enjoy being in Washington), however, I have now been asked a second time, and I believe it would be inappropriate for me to turn this request down.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 17:22:00 -0500",
    "summary": "It may sound spooky, but a black moon is nothing ominous.",
    "story": [
      "December is coming to an end with a \"black moon\" on Monday night, Dec. 30, but those hoping to see the phenomenon will be out of luck.",
      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "The moon will gradually become more visible in the coming days, reaching its first-quarter stage by Jan. 6 and becoming a full moon by Jan. 13, according to NASA.",
      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",
      "Most months have one full moon and one new moon because the lunar calendar largely lines up with a calendar year. But just as it's possible for there to be two new moons in a single month, there can also be two full moons, with the second full moon in a single month considered a blue moon. Similar to how black moon can have more than one meaning, blue moon also refers to the third full moon in a season with four full moons.",
      "There are no monthly or seasonal blue moons in 2025, according to TimeAndDate.com. The next monthly blue moon is on May 31, 2026 and the next seasonal blue moon will fall on May 20, 2027, with dates varying depending on time zone.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 09:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Hundreds of new species across the globe were identified by scientists in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "A vampire hedgehog, a pygmy pipehorse and a \"blob-headed\" fish were among the hundreds of new species identified in 2024.",
      "The variety of species identified was quite eclectic and names for the new species crossed a broad spectrum of locations and formations \u2014 some even inspired by politicians or celebrities.",
      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",
      "Here are some of the 2024 highlights.",
      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",
      "\"The function of this unusual structure remains a mystery,\" researchers said in a statement.",
      "However, the species was already familiar to Indigenous Awajun people who were working with the Rapid Assessment Program, researchers said.",

      "NASA said scientists at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began receiving more detailed telemetry \u2014 or \"housekeeping data\" \u2014 from the spacecraft on New Year's Day. The update showed that Parker had executed pre-programmed commands and that its science instruments were operational during the record-breaking approach.",
      "\"While Parker Solar Probe was closer to the Sun than any other human-made object in history, it operated just as it was designed to do, and made observations that no one has been able to make before,\" Parker Solar Probe Project Manager Helene Winters said in a statement. \"From the heat shield to the solar array cooling system, there was so much enabling technology required to fly this mission, and to gather data scientists have awaited for decades. Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",
      "Parker, which launched in 2018, has flown through the sun's crownlike outer atmosphere, or corona, and the spacecraft is expected to circle the sun through at least September. The probe's next two close flybys of the sun will occur March 22 and June 19, NASA said Thursday.",
      "Parker is the fastest spacecraft built by humans, and reached a top speed of 430,000 mph at closest approach, according to the Associated Press. The probe is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the AP reported.",
      "Researchers are hopeful that data from Parker will help them learn more about how and where solar winds are formed as well as why the sun's outer atmosphere is hundreds of times hotter than its surface.",

      "The new year will kick off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is set to peak early on Friday.",
      "The Quadrantids have the potential of 200 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, but most astronomy fans can catch 20-30 meteors an hour under clear, dark skies during the peak, according to NASA. The moon will be a \"mere crescent\" and set early in the night, which should make for good meteor viewing conditions, according to the space agency.",
      "When and where you can see the Quadrantids",
      "The meteor shower will peak in the early morning hours on Friday, according to NASA. While meteor showers last for days, the per hour rate of meteors will be best during the peak and the highest as dawn approaches.",
      "The Quadrantids will be active until Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas well away from city and street lights. The Quadrantids are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and observers in the Northwest and Pacific region will likely have the best viewing opportunities this year.",
      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. They streak through the sky every night, and when Earth encounters many meteors at once, it's called a meteor shower. The meteors heat up as they pass through the atmosphere, making them look like shooting stars.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Quadrantids come from asteroid 2003 EH1 \u2014 a small asteroid that was discovered on March 6, 2003.",
      "The Quadrantids are also known for their bright fireball meteors, with larger explosions of light and color that can last longer than an average meteor streak, according to NASA.",

      "Jan. 3: Quadrantid meteor shower",
      "Next year's first astral spectacle comes early, on Jan. 3, when the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. Considered one of the most impressive annual meteor showers to witness, the event can produce between 60 and 200 visible meteors under perfect weather conditions, according to NASA.",

People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",
      "March 29: Partial solar eclipse",
      "A partial solar eclipse will take shape a couple weeks later, on March 29. Like the lunar eclipse preceding it, this is the first of two partial solar eclipses slated for 2025, but the only one that will be visible in North America next year.",
      "The opposite of a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow onto the planet as it appears to cover the star. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",
      "The Lyrid meteor shower\u00a0is active from April 15 to April 30 next year, according to the American Meteorological Society. It is expected to peak between April 21 and April 22, with people in the Northern Hemisphere most likely to spot the sparkling display.",
      "Aug. 12-13: Perseid meteor shower",
      "The Perseid meteor shower\u00a0will peak between Aug. 12 and Aug. 13. Dubbed the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, this shower typically has the capacity to produce 50 to 100 visible meteors per hour when skies are clear enough to see them and they aren't overpowered by moonlight.",
      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",
      "Another partial solar eclipse is set for Sept. 21. This one will be visible in parts of Australia, in addition to Antarctica and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.",
      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",
      "Dec. 13-14: Geminid meteor shower",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",

      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Thursday the county coroner had determined Livelsberger shot himself in the head before the bombing.",

    "story": [
      "The string of coincidences that initially appeared to link the New Year's Day tragedies in New Orleans and Las Vegas have been overtaken by mounting evidence that the Tesla Cybertruck bombing at the Trump International Hotel was in fact a public display of a private tragedy, new information and interviews show.",
      "Decorated U.S. Army Special Forces Master Sgt. Matthew Livelsberger sent a disjointed email on the morning of New Year's Eve to Samuel Shoemate, a retired Army intelligence officer and military pundit. It outlined a constellation of grievances and dire warnings related to his military service, but gave no hint of, or explanation for, his actions.",
      "In a text made public by local authorities, Livelsberger wrote: \"I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\"",
      "And in an interview Friday, a former girlfriend of Livelsberger's said he told her he suffered a traumatic brain injury while serving in the Middle East. Alicia Arritt, who was in a relationship off and on with Livelsberger from 2018 to 2021, told CBS News that she exchanged around 30 texts with Livelsberger in the days leading up to the bombing.",
      "She said he gave no indication that he was planning to take his own life or blow up a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "\"He loved the Army and he gave his life and his mind for it,\" Arritt said.",
      "Experts told CBS News that Livelsberger may have been the latest illustration of an ongoing concern facing the U.S. military's most elite special operators \u2014 the heightened risk of brain injury, traumatic stress and mental health struggles.",
      "According to the National Center for PTSD, research on veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan suggests that 10% to 18% of those troops are likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder and be at risk for other mental health problems. Depression rates among troops returning from overseas range as high as 24%.",
      "The high-risk, high-intensity career has for years raised concerns about the toll that long-running exposure to combat violence can take on special forces soldiers.",
      "Livensberger's father told CBS News he had been at home in Colorado Springs with his wife and 8-month-old child on Christmas, on an approved military leave, before he rented the Cybertruck and began his meandering drive towards Las Vegas.",
      "The Pentagon told CBS News there \"were no red flags\" prior to Livelsberger's departure from Germany, where he was stationed with 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group. A CNN report Friday said Livensbeger visited military behavioral health services multiple times.",
      "A review of Livensberger's social media posts, interviews with friends who knew him well, and most pointedly, his email to Shoemate, offered indications he may have been struggling with those issues. On Friday, Shoemate discussed the letter on The Shawn Ryan Show, a podcast where Ryan, a former Navy SEAL and CIA contractor, interviews individuals primarily from the national security space.",
      "In the email obtained by CBS News, Livensberger referenced his ongoing concerns about civilian casualties caused by an airstrike in Afghanistan. The incident he mentioned appears to align with reports of U.S. airstrikes in May 2019 targeting alleged drug-processing facilities in Afghanistan, where more than 30 civilians, including children, were reportedly killed.",
      "CBS could not independently verify the letter's authenticity.",
      "Investigators said at a briefing Friday that Livelsberger planned and prepared for the Las Vegas bombing alone.",
      "On Sunday morning, the day after authorities say he rented the Cybertruck, Livelsberger sent Arritt photos of the Tesla and said, \"I rented a Tesla Cybertruck. It's the s***.\" She also told CBS News that\u00a0 Livelsberger sent her playful videos of himself listening to rap on the drive to Las Vegas.",
      "Arritt said the FBI visited her after the explosion. She said they told her he had been in contact with several other women in the days leading up to the bombing.",
      "Arritt said Livelsberger suffered a traumatic brain injury before she met him while deployed in the Middle East and he told her it caused a change in his behavior. He said he didn't want to get treatment for it.",
      "\"He felt it would ruin his career if he sought help,\" she said. \"All he wanted to do was deploy and get back to it.\"",
      "He suffered a lot of memory problems as a result of injuries he sustained during his service, including poor concentration, brain fog and headaches, she said.",
      "Arritt, a registered nurse, said she recognized these as symptoms of a TBI because she had worked on wards for service members with brain injuries and amputations at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center from 2008 to 2009.",
      "\"I understood him, even if he didn't know the words for it,\" she said.",
      "Arritt said he had guilt over some of his actions while deployed, expressing concern that his actions may have contributed to the deaths of innocent civilians.",
      "She said Livelsberger went through periods of isolation while they were together. \"He would disappear and just go cold for a couple of weeks. He was depressed but he always wanted to get through the depression. He recognized it and he was working on it. He pushed himself hard to get through it.\"",
      "Arritt described Livelsberger as kind and said she was shocked at his actions.",
      "\"I never saw him angry or act impulsively and he was always thoughtful in the things he did,\" she said. \"He was always the first person to jump into battle and stand up for someone else.\"",
      "Many former colleagues interviewed by CBS News expressed shock and sadness, including Fardin Fetwat, a former Afghan interpreter who deployed alongside Livelsberger. Fetwat credited Livelsberger with saving his life during combat and later helping him and his family resettle in Colorado, though they had not been in contact for several years. Describing Livelsberger's death, Fetwat said it felt like losing a brother, not just a colleague.",

    "summary": "The Biden administration blocked the purchase of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Here's what that could mean for the once iconic American company.",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration's move on Friday to\u00a0block Nippon Steel's proposed purchase\u00a0of U.S. Steel raises questions about the once iconic American company's future, with industry sources saying the manufacturer could struggle to energize growth or attract rival acquisition bids.",
      "President Biden stopped the $15 billion deal over national security and supply-chain concerns.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt blasted the decision, calling Mr. Biden's action \"shameful\" and \"corrupt\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk,\" Burritt said.",
      "Burritt added that the proposed deal \"is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities and our country.\"",
      "Limited options",
      "Industry experts said that without outside investment from Japan, the U.S-based steel manufacturer's path forward is murky.",
      "\"With foreign ownership seemingly off the table, we see limited avenues moving forward,\" Bill Peterson, metals and mining analyst for JPMorgan said in a research note.",
      "U.S. Steel leaders had warned that without an infusion of capital from Nippon Steel, it would be forced to curtail its legacy blast furnace investments and shift to cheaper nonunion electric arc furnaces. Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "The company could still entertain bids from domestic rivals, said Peterson, noting that U.S. Steel's mini-mill assets could be attractive to peers like steel products company Nucor Group, which considered buying parts of U.S. Steel before dropping out over price concerns.",
      "Others see rival bids as unlikely.",
      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",
      "Challenges from both sides",
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",
      "\"I think they have Federal Trade Commission issues in terms of monopolistic practices when it comes to companies merging,\" said corporate adviser Jay McDonald.",
      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",
      "\"One nice thing about the Nippon deal was we had a new entrant to the market buying assets, as opposed to continued consolidation in which you eventually get an oligopoly if the steel mills here continue to buy each other up,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If U.S. Steel can't turn around unprofitable plants, it may have no choice but to close them, Flack said, describing the company's future as uncertain.",
      "\"Blocking this deal doesn't serve anyone \u2014 customers, shareholders, workers or national security,\" he said, while adding, \"It will be challenged in court and we have a new administration coming in, so story is not written yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "Before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House he will return to the courthouse, a New York judge ruled Friday.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan will sentence Trump for his crimes on Jan. 10 \u2014 just 10 days before his inauguration on Jan. 20 \u2014 in a court proceeding that will be unlike any in America's 248 years. Trump's conviction in New York\u00a0stemmed from a\u00a0$130,000 so-called \"hush money\" payment\u00a0his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan's ruling ends two months of speculation \u2014 and back and forth jockeying by Trump's attorneys and prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u2014 following Trump's narrow election victory on Nov. 5.",
      "Trump became the first former president ever convicted of crimes in May, when a unanimous jury found him guilty in the New York case. Sentencing in the case was stalled for months as Trump campaigned for a return to the presidency. In November, he became the first person voted into the White House after a criminal conviction.",
      "The president-elect had argued in a motion to dismiss that his ascension to the White House mandated his conviction be vacated. Merchan said Friday that it did not.",
      "\"This court finds that neither the vacatur of the jury's verdicts nor dismissal of the indictment are required by the Presidential immunity doctrine, the Presidential Transition Act or the Supremacy Clause,\" Merchan wrote in his order Friday.",
      "Merchan indicated in his ruling that Trump will not be sentenced to serve time behind bars. He wrote that prosecutors agree with this decision. He also said that Trump may appear virtually, rather than in person for the sentencing.",
      "\"It seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the (prosecutors) concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Trump's lawyers claimed the constitutional demands on a president-elect \"superseded\" the jury's decision and ongoing proceedings in the case.",
      "Bragg's office argued that the judge had a range of options, including \"novel\" ones to balance the interests of justice with the unprecedented circumstance of a convicted defendant being elected to the presidency before sentencing. Their suggestions included postponing proceedings until after Trump's term in office, and even terminating the case and its proceedings with a note that the verdict had not been set aside.",
      "Merchan said Trump's own motion to dismiss acknowledged that a president-elect is not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, the transition period between election and the taking of the presidential oath is one filled with enormous responsibility,\" Merchan wrote. \"Yet, even (the) defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",
      "Trump's conviction carried with it the potential for up to four years in jail, but also a wide range of alternatives to incarceration, including probation and fines.",
      "Merchan said in his ruling that after Trump's victory, his attorneys' rhetoric changed from \"spirited\" to \"dangerously close to crossing the line.\"",
      "\"Counsel has resorted to language, indeed rhetoric, that has no place in legal pleadings. For example, countless times in their motion to dismiss, counsel accuses the prosecution and this court of engaging in 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional' conduct,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan cited a recent report by the Supreme Court's chief justice that warned about elected leaders undermining the judiciary",
      "\"Viewed in full context and mindful of the parties to this action, such arguments, in the broader picture, have the potential to create a chilling effect on the third branch of government,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Despite Merchan's excoriation, Trump communications director Steven Cheung did not hold back in a statement on the ruling. He called the case a \"witch hunt\" and Merchan \"deeply conflicted.\"",
      "\"This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\" Cheung said.",
      "Merchan's decision is the latest in a string of historical firsts set by the case. Trump's indictment in March 2023 made him the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally charged. He was subject to a seven-week trial this spring, which took place during the Republican presidential primaries.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Trump grumbled quietly, but often leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed as prosecutors and lawyers questioned more than 20 witnesses. At times his head drooped down, as he apparently dozed off. In the hallway just outside the courtroom \u2014 surrounded by a rotating posse of Republican allies, lawyers and Secret Service agents \u2014 Trump seethed about the case while campaigning to a gaggle of press cameras.",
      "At times, his dual commitments to the court and the cameras caused trouble. Merchan held Trump in contempt 10 times for violating a gag order prohibiting public statements about potential jurors, witnesses and others.",
      "Witnesses, beginning with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, described two schemes at the core of the case. The first was a plan hatched by Trump, Pecker and former attorney Michael Cohen to \"catch\" stories or allegations that might hurt Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy and \"kill\" them by paying people in exchange for nondisclosure agreements. Pecker and others described three such arrangements, known as \"hush money\" payments.",
      "Days before the election, Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2014 also a witness in the trial \u2014 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. He and another witness described Trump's relief that voters didn't learn of the story before the election.",
      "Cohen also described an arrangement in which he was covertly reimbursed for the payment to Daniels. The jury concluded Trump, while president in 2017, authorized a scheme to falsify business records in order to conceal Cohen's repayment. That scheme ultimately included 34 falsified records connected to monthly installments portrayed as payments for ongoing legal services, when they were in fact Cohen's reimbursements for the Daniels payoff.",
      "The jury took less than two days to reach its verdict. Trump, who had frequently stared at the jury of his peers during the trial, would not make eye contact with them as his sentence was pronounced.",
      "He looked straight ahead as the jury's foreperson pronounced Trump guilty 34 times, and as Merchan thanked the jury for their service before allowing them to file out of the room.",
      "After Merchan himself stepped out, Trump rose, frowning deeply, and briefly grasped his son Eric's hand.",
      "Trump led his entourage out of the courtroom, huddled for a moment with his lawyers, and then turned to address the cameras awaiting his reaction.",
      "He proclaimed his innocence, raged against the case and returned to his campaign for president.",

      "Alexander Paffendorf expressed regret for his involvement when a judge offered a chance for final words before keeping an order to confiscate his guns and ammunition in place until April 4. He didn't elaborate in his brief statement but authorities have said he told FBI agents that he had been messaging Natalie Rupnow, the Wisconsin shooter, about attacking a government building with a gun and explosives. Rupnow was a student at the school and went by Samantha, Madison police said.",
      "The shooter at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison killed Rubi Patricia Vergara, a 14-year-old freshman, and 42-year-old teacher Erin Michelle West, before fatally shooting herself, police said. At least six others were hurt in the shooting, authorities said, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Police have not disclosed a motive.",
      "A day after the Dec. 16 attack, a California judge issued a restraining order against Paffendorf, 20 at the time, under the state's gun red flag law. It required him to turn his guns and ammunition into police. He has not been charged with any crime.",
      "Paffendorf, appearing by video in a collared shirt and tie, said Friday that he was ready for a hearing on whether the restraining order should stay in effect but San Diego Superior Court Judge Devon Lomayesva delayed consideration after an attorney for the city of Carlsbad, north of San Diego, said Pattendorf was under criminal investigation. The judge decided it was in Pattendorf's interest to delay the hearing because he is under investigation and did not have an attorney.",
      "A detective told the judge that the FBI expected the investigation to conclude within two to three months.",
      "The restraining order doesn't say what government building Pattendorf targeted or when he planned to launch his attack. It also doesn't detail his interactions with the student except to state that he was plotting a mass shooting with her.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Several Western states are seeing rates worse than last year's peak of flu season.",
    "story": [
      "Emergency room visits with influenza are now \"very high\" nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, in this week's update on the winter respiratory virus season.",
      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",
      "In the Midwest, Indiana ranks as the state with the largest share of emergency room visits with COVID-19, though they remain a fraction of influenza visits and below last winter's peak.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

      "Jabbar's younger brother, 24-year-old Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, told CBS News that in the year leading up to the attack, his brother seemed to grow increasingly devout. He observed changes in Jabbar's lifestyle, noting that he adopted more modest attire, removed his tattoos and gave up alcohol.",

      "CEO Jeremy Bowen said 2024 was a difficult year for airlines due to severe weather patterns and the summer technology outage. The winning airlines therefore deserved credit for getting most passengers to their destinations on time, Bowen said.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies have warned about the risk of \"copycat or retaliatory attacks\" after a man drove a\u00a0rented pickup truck through a crowd of New Year's revelers on New Orleans' Bourbon Street, killing 14 people before he was shot dead in a firefight with police.",
      "The bulletin, reviewed by CBS News, was released overnight and distributed to law enforcement partners nationwide. It warned that vehicle ramming attacks are \"likely to remain attractive for aspiring attackers\" because of the relative ease of requiring a vehicle and the \"low skill threshold necessary\" to carry out such a plot.",
      "The tactic has often been used by ISIS in the past, according to the bulletin. Neither ISIS nor any other terror group has claimed responsibility for the Bourbon Street attack, the bulletin said, but the driver, identified as\u00a0Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. Army veteran from\u00a0from Houston, declared his support for ISIS in a series of videos posted\u00a0before the attack.",
      "The federal bulletin noted that official ISIS messaging between 2014 and 2016 called for ramming attacks followed with secondary weapons. At least 13 attacks using vehicles as weapons were carried out in the United States, Canada and Europe between 2016 and 2017, the agencies said. The\u00a0Bourbon Street attack is the seventh attack inspired by a foreign terror organization on U.S. soil since 2001, the bulletin said, and the first since 2017 to result in fatalities.",
      "\"The surge in vehicle-ramming attacks in 2016 and 2017 suggests that successful attacks \u2014 particularly in the West \u2014 may inspire similarly motivated actors to adopt the same method,\" the bulletin said.",
      "Online, foreign terror organizations and supporter groups had released multiple videos calling for violence during the winter holidays, specifically New Year's celebrations, the bulletin said. Another deadly vehicle ramming incident occurred just over a week before the Bourbon Street attack: A man intentionally drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Germany on Dec. 22, 2024, killing five people and leaving more than 200 people injured. German officials said mental illness may have played a role in that case.",
      "Supporters of the terror group have celebrated both attacks online, the bulletin said.",
      "Perpetrators of such attacks may also have secondary weapons, like improvised explosive devices or guns, the bulletin warned. Jabbar had planted two IEDs, hidden in coolers, both of which were found and neutralized by authorities, the FBI said in a briefing Thursday. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News that the suspect also had an AR-15 style weapon and a handgun with him at the time of the attack. He fired at police and wounded two officers before being shot and killed,\u00a0CBS News previously reported.",
      "The bulletin highlighted some warning signs that officials can watch for, including online calls for violence against a specific event, or a person trying to rent or lease a vehicle with false documents or giving vague or unverifiable information on rental agreements without a reasonable explanation. Unexplained inconsistencies in the reasoning for renting a vehicle, or nervousness or a refusal to answer questions about the reason for rental, may also be a sign for concern, the bulletin said. Officials should also watch for inquiries about modifying a vehicle for heavier loads or faster speeds, and monitor reports of rental vehicles parked near sensitive facilities for a prolonged period of time.",

      "\"This all just caught everybody completely by surprise,\" Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said.",
      "Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said his brother had recently gone through an expensive divorce. It was his third divorce, according to court records. His first marriage ended in 2012, with his ex-wife gaining custody of their two children. He was married again from 2013 to 2016, and married his third wife in 2017. The couple had one child and divorced in 2022.",
      "In divorce filings, Jabbar said his monthly expenses, including child support for his first two children, exceeded his income. A pay stub from 2022 shows Jabbar was earning about $125,000 a year from his job at Deloitte. The company confirmed he had been hired there in 2021. His then-wife also accused him of financial mismanagement, including giving money to other lovers, in a separate court filing. During those divorce proceedings, Jabbar's wife obtained a temporary restraining order against him.",
      "Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said while they cared for their father, his brother \"was a strong proponent of marriage staying together.\" He said his brother also told him he had dropped \"habits\" like drinking, drugs and sex outside of marriage. His manner of dress also became more modest, Abdur-Rahim Jabbar recalled, and he had some tattoos removed.",
      "None of the changes alarmed Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, however, and he said he was \"shocked\" to hear of his brother's actions on New Year's Day.",
      "\"He'd been a practicing Muslim since he was a kid and everything, and I think he took a step away from religion at some point in his life, and then he came back into it,\" Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said.",
      "FBI investigators say Shamsud-Din Jabbar shared videos on social media before the attack declaring support for ISIS and saying he had initially planned to hurt his family and friends, but \"was concerned the news headlines would not focus on the quote, 'war between the believers and the disbelievers,' end quote,\" deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Christopher Raia said at a briefing Thursday. Raia said investigators are still trying to determine why Shamsud-Din Jabbar targeted Bourbon Street.",
      "Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said he has met with FBI investigators. He said they also asked about his brother's demeanor and personality, and if his behavior had changed recently.",
      "\"None of it feels real, but with every moment someone reaches out to me, news, media reporters, anybody, the FBI, it solidifies as being real,\" Abdur-Rahim Jabbar said. \"I can't imagine what those families (of the victims) are going through either. I'm sure they're grieving as much as I am, as my family is.\"",

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock were in the Syrian capital for talks on behalf of the European Union, in the highest-level visit by major Western powers since Islamist-led forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad last month.",
      "One of their first stops was the notorious Sednaya prison, not far from the capital.",
      "Accompanied by White Helmet rescuers, Barrot and Baerbock toured the cells and underground dungeons of Sednaya, which for decades stood as a fearsome symbol of the atrocities committed against Assad's opponents.",

An advocacy group said more than 4,000 people were freed from the detention facility when rebel forces took Damascus on December 8.

      "Sharaa has distanced himself and HTS from al-Qaeda in recent years, and the group's public statements have suggested plans to respect Syria's myriad religious groups.",
      "The Biden administration said after Assad fled to Russia that the U.S. could recognize a new Syrian government under certain conditions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new leadership and the transition process must ensure the protection of Syria's minority groups, a flow of humanitarian aid into the country, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorist organizations, and help ensure that any chemical and biological weapons are secured and destroyed.",

      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It's the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.",
      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon's residence for hours due to concerns about their safety.",
      "The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces and expressed \"serious regret about the attitude of the suspect, who did not comply with the legal process.\"",
      "The National Police Agency said it planned to investigate the chief and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service on suspicion of obstructing official duty and summoned them for questioning on Saturday.",
      "Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.",
      "Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon's detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.",
      "Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.",

They said police officers don't have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens.\" They didn't elaborate further on the claim.",
      "If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called the anti-corruption agency's withdrawal regrettable and urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon on Friday.",

There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.",
      "Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon's detention, but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il, were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn't immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, another lawyer on Yoon's legal team, said the agency's efforts to detain Yoon were \"reckless\" and showed an \"outrageous discard for law.\"",
      "South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence's grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment. South Korea's YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.",
      "As the standoff progressed, the Democrats called on the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn't immediately comment on the situation.",
      "\"Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,\" said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must \"remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,\" Jo said.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon's fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.

    "summary": "China's Ministry of Commerce adds 28 U.S. entities to export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists digging in the Jordan Valley recently discovered a collection of ancient coins during this year's Hanukkah holiday.",
    "story": [
      "A rare collection of ancient coins was discovered last week by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins are more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty that presided over Judea in the final centuries leading up to the common era, according to the University of Haifa in Israel.",
      "Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during ongoing excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan. The project is headed by researchers at the University of Haifa and the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, the university\u00a0said in a news release translated from Hebrew.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed Friday, coinciding with the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "Each coin bears inscriptions that include an eight-pointed star and the phrase \"King Alexander 25\" written in Aramaic, one of the world's oldest known languages that originated in the region around what's now Syria and is closely related to both Arabic and Hebrew. These types of coins date back to about 80 B.C.E., according to the University of Haifa.",
      "\"The site where the treasure was discovered is, apparently, a way station, which had not been recognized in research until now,\" said Shai Bar, one of the leaders of the excavation, in a statement to the university. Bar said the station included a purification bath, used for religious ritual, and a water storage area in addition to other buildings. It's located along a main road leading to the Alexandrion fortress, built atop a mountain in the Jordan Valley by Alexander Jannaeus.",
      "Bar told the university that students and volunteers were involved in the dig that uncovered the monarch's ancient coins. He said they were particularly excited to find the trove during Hanukkah.",
      "\"This added special meaning to the holiday for them, including in the difficult days our people are going through at the moment,\" Bar said. \"I hope that the place will become a site that attracts a crowd, and will be added to the archaeological and heritage sites of our country.\"",

    "summary": "If 12 grapes are eaten at the stroke of midnight, Spanish tradition holds good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
    "story": [
      "Can grapes bring you luck? Spaniards believe so, and at midnight on New Year's Eve all across the country it's a race to gobble 12 grapes all before the first minute of the year passes.",
      "The 12 grapes, which stand for the months of the year, need to be eaten one by one before the clock changes to 12:01. If the grapes are consumed, the tradition states good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
      "Where does the tradition of eating 12 grapes come from?",
      "The origins of the \"uvas de la suerte\" tradition\u00a0are hard to trace. The idea might have begun with grape farmers in Alicante, Spain, to unload a surplus in the early 1900s, reported Atlas Obscura. Grapes are a reasonably priced crop that tends to fare well, and there are often surpluses so the fruit can be brought cheaply.",
      "Or it might have been Madrid's bourgeoisie copying the French tradition of having grapes and champagne on the last day of the year, NPR reported. But the story goes that the Madrid residents wanted to rebel against class distinctions and decided to mock aristocrats by going to Puerta del Sol to eat grapes accompanied by the sound of the bells.",
      "Whatever the beginnings were, the tradition has caught on like wildfire in Spain. Supermarket chains such as Mercadona and Super Sol advertise and sell \"uvas de la suerte\" across Spain.",
      "Mercadona, one of Spain's largest grocery chains, advertised four ways to purchase grapes for the occasion. Natural bunch grapes with seeds from Alicante add \"an element of fun to the tradition of the 12 grapes.\" The seeds provide a \"crunchy touch,\" the supermarket said. Consumers can also buy grapes without seeds, or prepackaged grapes \"specially selected and packaged with the exact amount needed for each chime.\"",
      "Prepackaged grapes allow revelers to open the grapes at the precise moment the clock changes and not worry about counting or peeling the grapes in the midst of the excitement of the celebration.",
      "Grapes can also be bought peeled and pitted in a can. These grapes are among the most popular for Spaniards due to their convenience, the supermarket said.",
      "What are the exact rules for the New Year's grape tradition?",
      "Regardless of how the grapes are purchased, eating them at midnight on Nochevieja is key to celebrating\u00a0in Spain. Celebrants need to eat the grapes before the clock chimes 12:01 a.m., and if consumed in full, tradition holds that good luck will be by your side for the entire year.",
      "Spaniards commonly choose green grapes for this tradition.",
      "Where did the idea of eating grapes under the table come from?",

      "In the past, drug cartels in Mexico have often handed out gifts or bags of food to local people around the holidays, to try to improve their image or build local support. The cartels often want local people to warn them of army raids, but at the same time the gangs usually extort protection money from local residents.",
      "Videos posted on social media last week from the town of Coalcoman, in the western state of Michoacan, showed a sign at a Christmas fair thanking Jalisco cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera -- better known by his nickname \"El Mencho\" -- for the gifts.",

      "\"El Mencho\" has also been indicted in the United States and the State Department just this month increased a reward to\u00a0$15 million\u00a0for his capture.

Just last month, former prosecutor and local police official Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested in connection with the grisly\u00a0decapitation of a mayor\u00a0on Oct. 6.

      "Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecution, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon's powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which drew hundreds of troops and police officers into Seoul streets.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has called \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government's budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants. He's ignored repeated requests by investigative authorities to appear for questioning, and the presidential security service has blocked attempts to search his office and residence citing a law that bans raids on sites with state secrets.",
      "A lawyer for Yoon rejected the anti-corruption agency's request for warrants on Monday, arguing it lacked legal authority to investigate rebellion charges.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on how to proceed with the warrants.",
      "\"Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\" said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \"Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\"",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon's residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",
      "Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant is likely an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with investigations.",
      "Former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 following an impeachment over a corruption scandal, also refused to meet with prosecutors while in office. She underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court removed her from office.",
      "Yoon's imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Despite Yoon's deployment of troops and police, enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law enactment.",
      "Yoon has claimed he wasn't trying to stop the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. But comments by now-arrested commanders of military units sent to the assembly have contradicted this claim. Kwak Jong-keun, the commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, testified at the National Assembly that Yoon called on troops to \"quickly knock down the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\" Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon's orders.",
      "The country's political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the Constitutional Court. Observers say adding more justices could affect the court's ruling on Yoon's impeachment.",

Work is purpose. How many people retire, and they die just a few years after they retire, and why? Because they have nothing to do.

      "The researchers connected to the new study said that one way to explore biological mechanisms is to look at proteins circulating in the blood, SWNS noted. Proteins, which are molecules produced by genes, are essential for helping the human body function properly.",

      "\"Social relationships play an important part in keeping us healthy,\" said one of the scientists connected to a new study.\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "\"We know that social isolation and loneliness are linked to poorer health, but we\u2019ve never understood why.\"",
      "Loneliness, by contrast, is a subjective measure based on whether an individual feels lonely.",
      "When the researchers analyzed the proteomes and adjusted for factors including age, sex and socio-economic background, they found 175 proteins associated with social isolation and 26 proteins associated with loneliness.",
      "6 TIPS TO \u2018DETOX\u2019 AFTER EXCESSIVE HOLIDAY EATING AND DRINKING",
      "Many of the proteins are produced in response to inflammation, viral infection and as part of immune responses, the team said \u2014 and they also showed links to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and early death.",
      "The findings, said a researcher, \"drive home the importance of social contact in keeping us well.\" (iStock)",
      "The researchers then used a statistical technique to explore the causal relationship between social isolation and loneliness, on the one hand, and proteins on the other.",
      "With that approach, they identified five proteins that were found in abundance during periods of loneliness.",
      "\"We know that social isolation and loneliness are linked to poorer health, but we\u2019ve never understood why,\" said Dr. Chun Shen of the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and the Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University.",

      "Professor Jianfeng Feng of the University of Warwick said, \"There are more than 100,000 proteins and many of their variants in the human body \u2026 AI and high-throughput proteomics can help us pinpoint some key proteins in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for many human diseases and revolutionize the traditional view of human health.\"",

Then, one day, you find out that some company you've never heard of is selling your personal information to whoever wants to buy it. It's not just alarming. It could actually put your financial security at risk.",
      "These companies are data brokers that collect and sell people's personal information, often without us even knowing about it. And get this: Some of them might be trading info that could affect your retirement savings.",
      "Crazy, right? But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. There are things we can do to protect ourselves. I want to talk about how these data brokers operate and what steps you can take to keep your retirement plans safe.",

      "How data brokers are endangering your retirement security",
      "There\u2019s one major way in which data brokers are endangering your retirement security, and it\u2019s right there in the name: data brokers buy, sell, trade and otherwise spread your personal information far and wide. This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",
      "In other words, something aimed right at you and very difficult to ignore. Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",
      "Any of the above types of scams can end in what might be the ultimate fraud \u2013 identity theft \u2013 but these three are more likely to get there, and in fewer steps, than the others.",

Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",

Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails.

      "Turo has been proactive in advocating for additional regulations in various states to establish clearer operational guidelines. A significant development occurred in 2022 when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed SB 6715 into law, providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car-sharing operations in the state. This legislation aims to expand transportation options and create economic opportunities for New Yorkers while addressing safety and insurance concerns.",

As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures.

      "International call scams have become increasingly common in recent years. One particularly prevalent scam is known as \"Wangiri,\" which originates from Japan and means \"one-ring-and-cut.\" These scammers typically let your phone ring once or twice before hanging up, hoping to pique your curiosity and prompt a callback.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Why are you receiving these international scam calls?",
      "There are several reasons why you might be receiving calls from unfamiliar international numbers.",
      "Wangiri scam: Scammers use automated systems to call thousands of numbers, disconnecting after one ring. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate number, incurring significant charges.",

      "Is your phone at risk?",
      "While receiving unexpected international calls doesn't necessarily put your phone at immediate risk, there are several potential dangers to be aware of.\u00a0The primary risk lies in potential financial losses if you engage with these scammers. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "While these international calls can be concerning, there are several steps you can take to safeguard yourself and your personal information. Here are six effective strategies to help protect against potential scams and unwanted calls.",
      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1) Encrypting your internet connection: This makes it extremely difficult for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to intercept and read your data.",
      "2) Masking your IP address: By hiding your real IP address, a VPN allows you to browse the internet anonymously, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your online activities.",

Using a\u00a0VPN service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Therefore, it's important to have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats.",

      "1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:\u00a0Janet\u2019s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software.",
      "2) Urgent audio and visual cues: Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically.",
      "3) Requests to install remote access software: Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims\u2019 systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag.",

      "Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn\u2019t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection.

      "Stop all communication: Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them.",
      "Report the scam: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them.",

      "Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.",
      "Inform credit bureaus: Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "Be cautious about future communications: Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics.",
      "Use identity theft protection: If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process.

If you ever encounter a situation like Janet\u2019s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system.

    "story": [
      "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover.",
      "Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what\u2019s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you\u2019re not home.",
      "But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose a privacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data.",

      "Smart outdoor camera\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How smart home cameras can be spying on you",
      "According to a\u00a0study conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That\u2019s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What\u2019s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity.",
      "Indoor security camera apps are slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",

      "The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "9 ways to stay safe from the risks associated with smart home cameras",
      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",
      "2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:\u00a0Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It\u2019s important to regularly review the app\u2019s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",
      "3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Make sure your camera\u2019s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible: This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",
      "Disable location tracking: The security company may use location data for features like geofencing, which triggers actions based on your proximity to your home. If you're concerned about privacy, you can disable location tracking in the app to prevent the system from collecting this data.Limit video storage: Many security company\u2019s cameras can store video footage in the cloud, but you can adjust the app settings to limit how long footage is stored or to delete it automatically after a certain period.Adjust device permissions: Review and adjust permissions for devices like cameras and smart locks to limit data collection. For example, disable audio recording if it's not necessary for your security needs.Control third-party data sharing: Your security company may share data with third parties, so it's essential to check and disable any settings that allow your data to be shared beyond your security system\u2019s ecosystem.",

      "Hackey first went public with his story to the local news station WTVR-TV last month, revealing the confusion surrounding one of his twin son's injuries. He suffered a mysterious fracture to his tibia in September 2023. His mother, a former NICU nurse herself, reported the injury to social services.",
      "It wasn't until a year later that Henrico CPS told them it had concluded that their son was the victim of physical abuse from an unnamed hospital staffer. Then in October, county police reportedly told them about the other, similar cases.",

      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, we are not admitting any additional babies into our NICU at this time,\" the hospital said on Christmas Eve. \"While fractures occasionally happen with pre-term babies since they lack full fetal bone development, we are actively working to determine how these fractures occurred.\"",
      "Now 16 months, Noah Hackey has since recovered from his injury.\u00a0 (Courtesy of Dominique Hackey)",
      "While hospital officials said previously that fractures can happen to premature babies, they nevertheless increased security, installed new surveillance systems and notified police after the second series of attacks.",
      "New safety measures included training on general safety and how to identify and report signs of abuse, head-to-toe examinations of the patients by doctors, and an observer system where each health care provider is accompanied by another clinician whenever they enter a baby's room, the hospital said.",

      "They also turned over hours of surveillance video to police, who were still going through footage after arresting Strotman in connection with an incident that happened on Nov. 10.",

      "Charges have not been filed in Hackey's case, but police said they are actively collecting evidence in all of the remaining incidents.",
      "Finally we can get some answers as to who abused our son. I wish I could say it was a happy moment learning of her arrest, however, learning the details involving the other babies, the only feeling I have is sadness and regret.",
      "Strotman is a resident of Midlothian, a suburb of Richmond, and authorities are looking at her in connection with a number of similar cases between 2023 and 2024, Henrico police said Friday \u2013 including inactive cases.",

We see in Israel that in order to eradicate terror, we need to focus on it only to deal with it on a daily basis,\" Shoshan said. \"I've been in communication with the authorities here.\"",

      "The group embraces Sunni\u00a0Islamist\u00a0ideology that seeks to establish a global\u00a0caliphate, a global Islamic state governed by a strict interpretation of Sharia law.",

In 2013, AQI changed its name to ISIS and in 2014 the group separated from al-Qaeda, declaring itself a caliphate, taking over vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.",

      "A defense official, however, told Fox News that there was no evidence based on their military service that the attacks were related. While both men served at Fort Liberty, formerly known as Fort Bragg, they were there at different times. The North Carolina base is currently home to more than 50,000 service members.",
      "Authorities continued to release new information at separate news briefings Thursday, with FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia telling reporters in New Orleans that there was \"no definitive link\" uncovered between the attack and the explosion.",

Between 2007 and 2015, Jabbar was a human resources specialist and an IT specialist. Livelsberger was an Army Green Beret in the 10th Special Forces group.",

      "\"We are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\" Turo said in a statement. \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Livelsberger, 37, was an active duty soldier at the time of his death.",
      "Livelsberger was the only fatality in the Cybertruck explosion, McMahill said. Investigators believe he shot himself in the head before the truck blew up \u2013 sending flames, fireworks and shrapnel upward just steps away from the hotel's glass doors, which were not damaged.",
      "Matthew Livelsberger seen in a photograph. (Fox News)",
      "FBI Special Agent Spencer Evans added that investigators were looking for potential terror ties to Livelsberger but had not found any as of Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"The question about whether it's being investigated globally, absolutely \u2013\u00a0like I said, we're running down investigative leads around the world,\" he told reporters. \"No information that we're aware of right now that connects this individual to any terrorist organization around the world, but that's obviously the thrust of the investigation\u2026ruling out that there's any sort of terrorism nexus.\"",
      "The New Orleans attack, on the other hand, was clearly terror-inspired, authorities said. It killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more, according to authorities, who said Jabbar then opened fire on responding officers. They returned fire and neutralized the threat.",

      "\"Let me be clear about this point \u2013 this was an act of terrorism,\" Raia told reporters at a news briefing Thursday. \"It was premeditated and an evil act.\"",
      "Jabbar, 42, crashed the truck and died in a gun battle with police, who said they found an Islamic State group flag in the rented Ford F-150 EV Jabbar used in the attack. He posted videos to social media prior to his attack vowing allegiance to the Islamic State, according to authorities.",
      "\"He was 100% inspired by ISIS,\" Raia said, adding that investigators believe he acted alone, however. They were no longer looking for additional persons of interest on Thursday.",

      "\"We want to speak to them as witnesses and want to know what they saw and when,\" he added.",

      "More recently, he worked for Deloitte, a major international accounting firm where he made about $10,000 a month, according to FOX Business.",
      "Raia said it was still \"very early\" in the investigation, but the FBI had not uncovered any ties between the New Orleans attack and an explosion of a rented Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "David Katz, a former federal agent and firearms trainer and now the CEO of Global Security Group, told Fox News Digital that a potential military connection would be a red flag reminiscent of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. The bomber Timothy McVeigh and accomplice Terry Nichols met while in the Army.",

    "summary": "A third year of war in Ukraine drags on as the new year and the conflict&apos;s February anniversary approach. The war in 2024 saw major shifts on the battlefield and in Western politics.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram provides details on the White House response to Russia's Christmas Day attack and the incoming Trump administration's push for a rapid end to the war.",
      "As the third year of war in Ukraine nears a close as the new year approaches and ahead of the Feb. 24, 2025, anniversary date, new battle lines have once again been established after Russia made advances in the east and Kyiv opened a new battlefront, this time in Russia.",
      "The war that had already plagued Europe, the U.S. and, to an extent, the Middle East, costing a whopping $278 billion\u00a0in aid for Ukraine, including\u00a0nearly $87 billion\u00a0from Washington, expanded to Asia in 2024 as geopolitical rivalries in the Indo-Pacific began playing out through proxy in Ukraine.",
      "2024 began with a heated fight in Congress over whether the U.S. should supply more military aid to Ukraine, a fight that highlighted major divisions in the Republican Party and Kyiv's deep reliance on Washington's military support.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers are shown during a training exercise on Dec. 15, 2024. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The monthslong debate, which finally ended in April, had major implications for Ukraine when it came to its ability to defend against Moscow's missiles and its ability to counter Russian offenses. In 2023, Russia was unable to make any major advances despite the sheer number of men the Kremlin has long been able to throw into its war machine.",
      "But 2024 politics in the U.S. changed the reality of war for Ukraine.",
      "NATO LEADERS PREDICT ERA OF 2% DEFENSE SPENDING 'PROBABLY HISTORY' AS TRUMP REPORTEDLY FLOATS HIGHER TARGET",
      "The stalled supplies not only significantly increased Ukraine\u2019s vulnerabilities in the east, particularly in Donetsk, it enhanced frustration from Kyiv, NATO allies and those who argued that defending Ukraine is in the U.S.\u2019s security interest. It escalated attention around the Biden administration\u2019s strike bans on U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, which the president eventually lifted in November.",
      "As U.S. politics at home grew increasingly volatile ahead of the presidential election, uncertainty mounted over what another Trump White House could mean for Kyiv; a question that has already had other geopolitical consequences.",
      "In late April, the House passed a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine that pushed U.S. financial commitments to $183 billion since Russia first launched its invasion in 2022. The package was meant to prompt an immediate surge in the delivery of military equipment and supplies, which, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, had fallen to 10% of what it had been the year before.",
      "The European Union in June officially began membership talks with Ukraine after determining Kyiv had met the necessary requirements to join an economic and political partnership by countering corruption, reining in political lobbying, increasing transparency around officials\u2019 wealth and bolstering the rights of national minorities.",
      "By the July NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., some members began ramping up pressure on the Biden administration, along with other allies like the U.K. and Germany, to lift any and all strike restrictions enforced on Ukraine, which prevented Kyiv from hitting military targets and weapons depots deep inside Russia, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly said was needed to better stop Russia\u2019s missile and drone attacks.",

      "That figure appeared to have been whittled down by the time it reached Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s desk in early December as he signed off on a 13.5 trillion ruble plan ($124 million), and it accounts for 32.5% of Russia\u2019s 2025 budget, according to the Associated Press.",

      "President Biden has vowed to fast-track as much military assistance to Ukraine as he can during the final days in office.",
      "Throughout the war, Russia has relied on a heavy missile and drone campaign to brutalize the entirety of Ukraine. But in 2024, Moscow escalated its aerial attacks targeting towns and cities, particularly in eastern Ukraine, ahead of its infantry advances, even if it meant the complete decimation of urban areas.",
      "The ruins of Toretsk, Ukraine, are shown on Dec. 19, 2024. (Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "2024 saw more battlefield movement than 2023, though according to data provided by the Institute for the Study of War, this was largely seen in the second half of the year, a price for which Russian paid heavily.",
      "November proved to be a particularly brutal month, with Russia seeing its highest battlefield losses ever with 45,720 casualties reported in November, which was up from nearly 42,000 in October, along with an estimated $3 billion worth of military equipment, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.",
      "Moscow also twice set the record for the greatest number of drone strikes it levied against Ukraine in a single campaign since the war began, first with 145 drones fired overnight on Nov. 9, followed by 188 strikes beginning the night of Nov. 25.",
      "After more than a year of a relatively stagnant front line, Russia in May launched a new front in Kharkiv, which Ukraine had liberated in 2022, though the Kremlin\u2019s renewed offensive largely failed.",

      "RUSSIAN PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS KILLED IN FRIENDLY FIRE ATTACK BY NORTH KOREANS AFTER ENLISTING DPRK HELP",
      "By early August, Ukraine made international headlines when it launched a surprise ground incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region. It was an apparent attempt to divert forces from eastern Ukraine to the Kremlin\u2019s home turf and give it a bargaining chip when the time comes for peace negotiations.",
      "The campaign was the largest attack on Russia since World War II, and by mid-October the Pentagon had confirmed that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia, with some 11,000 North Korean soldiers believed to be fighting Ukraine in Kursk, the first foreign nation to send in troops since the war began.",
      "Though North Korea is not the only nation to aid Russia in its invasion, Iran has for years been sending Shahed drones. In September, the U.S. accused Iran of supplying Russia with short-range ballistic missiles.",
      "Ukraine is estimated to have lost 40% of the land it initially seized in Russia, according to reports last month. But North Korea is also reported to have endured heavy losses, with Zelenskyy claiming this week that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed in the fighting while others face extreme logistical shortages, including access to clean water, the Associated Press reported.",

      "China has also been accused of aiding Russia by covertly sending it military support in the form of microelectronics and semiconductors, among other items.",
      "North Korea\u2019s direct involvement in Russia\u2019s war has further highlighted the divisions in the Indo-Pacific that have arisen in recent years, not only in the face of Chinese aggression, but Pyongyang\u2019s, which is a dynamic that has become caught up in the largest war Europe has seen since World War II as Japan and South Korea increasingly back Western allies and view the Russia-North Korea alliance as a threat.",
      "North Korea\u2019s deployment of troops to Russia reportedly prompted South Korea to consider escalating its non-lethal aid by mulling over a supply of missiles. Japan on Christmas Day sent Ukraine $3 billion in frozen Russian assets, adding to the $12 billion Tokyo has provided to Kyiv. In addition, Japan also pledged to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, which Russia routinely targets.",
      "Russia once again solidified its primary winter strategy by attacking Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure on Christmas Day by firing 184 drones and missiles across the country, according to Ukraine\u2019s air force. The attacks sparked mass blackouts amid freezing temperatures in multiple regions, including Kharkiv in the north, the central Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava areas, as well as Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 20:13:58 GMT",
    "summary": "A new Congress starts Friday with a long to-do list for Donald Trump\u2019s second term: keeping the government open, raising the debt ceiling, immigration and taxes.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The new Congress began Friday, ushering in a tiny House Republican majority to tackle enormous tasks in the first year of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, from keeping the government open to averting a calamitous debt default to advancing the president-elect\u2019s immigration and tax ambitions.",
      "Republicans won a 220-215 seat majority in the 2024 elections, but they started off with 219 members as former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., resigned and opted not to reclaim his seat.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was re-elected to his post by a single vote on Friday after some drama, losing the only defection he could afford in Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. He flipped two other initial holdouts after keeping the first ballot open. But holding the gavel was the easy part: What comes next will present the biggest test of the Louisiana Republican\u2019s political career.",
      "Johnson\u2019s majority is poised to shrink even further in the coming weeks, with Trump announcing he\u2019ll pluck two House Republicans to serve in his administration \u2014 Michael Waltz of Florida to be national security adviser and Elise Stefanik of New York to be United Nations ambassador. Replacing them is likely to take months.",
      "If both leave before Gaetz is replaced, that would cut the majority to an even more tenuous 217-215, meaning a single Republican defection could tank a bill unless Democrats vote in favor.",
      "In other words, House Republicans will have a zero-vote margin for defection in the crucial early months of Trump\u2019s presidency. Even when the party returns to full strength, the House majority could have trouble passing party-line legislation if a handful of members fall ill, have scheduling conflicts or experience weather delays preventing them from getting to Washington in time for key votes. Republicans will have a slightly larger majority in the Senate, 53-47, when senators are sworn in Friday and begin work on scheduling hearings for Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees.",
      "And they have a tall to-do list. Here\u2019s what is on the 2025 agenda.",
      "Funding the government by March 14",
      "Last month\u2019s drawn-out fight over a short-term bill to prevent a government shutdown just punted the deadline to March 14, less than two months after Trump takes the oath of office. That means Republicans still need to cut a deal with Democrats on how to fund the government, which routinely causes clashes between GOP moderates, military hawks and conservative hard-liners.",
      "If history is any guide, House Republicans are unlikely to find enough votes to pass a bill without Democrats, as they always lose some votes on the right. But even if they manage to unify their House conference, they will need 60 Senate votes to make a law, which means House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will need to sign off on any deal in order to prevent a shutdown.",
      "That means Johnson will ultimately have to sell another compromise package to members who routinely raise hackles against such bills.",
      "Pass Trump's agenda on immigration, energy and taxes",
      "Republicans hope to move quickly on legislation to advance core components of Trump\u2019s agenda. They\u2019ve made clear they will use the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process to bypass the Senate\u2019s 60-vote rule and pass a bill with only Republican votes.",
      "That process has limitations. It begins with passing a budget resolution to lay down fiscal parameters and instruct committees, and then the final bill can only make changes to spending and tax policy, which will require compromises that conservatives would prefer not to accept. Democrats can challenge and strip out any provisions that are not tax- or spending-related and thus don\u2019t qualify for the 50-vote path.",
      "Disagreements have already spilled out into the open. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is pushing for breaking it up into two bills in hopes of getting a quick victory on giving Trump more border security funding before bringing up another party-line measure later this year to extend Trump\u2019s tax cuts ahead of their expiration on the last day of 2025. But the chair of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., is warning Republicans that delaying the tax bill could jeopardize it and risk a multitrillion-dollar tax hike.",
      "Whichever strategy they pursue, Republicans will also have to achieve near-unanimity on divisive questions like how much to add to the deficit and which parts of outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s legacy achievements to repeal in order to pay for their new policies. The latter is more complicated than it sounds \u2014 major portions of the Biden clean-energy programs that GOP leaders are targeting for repeal benefit conservative districts represented by Republicans.",
      "Extend the debt ceiling",
      "Under a bipartisan law signed last year, the U.S. is poised to hit the debt ceiling this month and will begin to use \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to pay the bills and prevent a default that could have catastrophic consequences for the American \u2014 and global \u2014 economy. That\u2019s likely to buy Congress a few months, but members will invariably have to extend the debt ceiling sometime this year.",
      "Last month, Trump\u2019s eleventh-hour demand that Congress take the debt ceiling off his plate was widely rebuffed by both parties. Despite Trump\u2019s threat to court primary challenges against Republicans who voted for a funding bill without resolving the debt limit, 170 GOP members supported such a measure.",
      "Many Republicans routinely vote against lifting or extending the debt ceiling. But Democrats, who usually fill the void, may be reluctant to help Republicans lift the debt ceiling just as the GOP is passing a party-line tax bill the opposition says would primarily benefit the wealthy.",
      "So, will Republicans cut a deal with Democrats? Will they find a way to raise the borrowing limit with only GOP votes, perhaps in a reconciliation bill?",
      "Behind closed doors last month, Republicans made a pact to pursue $2.5 trillion in spending cuts in 2025 alongside a debt limit hike, a way to appease conservative hard-liners. But some say that deal isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s printed on.",
      "\u201cThey call that a gentleman\u2019s agreement,\u201d Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who has opposed past bills to lift the debt limit, told NBC News. \u201cAnd there are no gentlemen up here, dude.\u201d"

      "A trio of conservative rebels initially voted to block Johnson from being re-elected speaker, defying President-elect Donald Trump, who backed the Louisiana Republican, and threatening to paralyze the House.",
      "They were among nine Republicans who publicly hesitated during the speaker\u2019s vote \u2014 two initially voted for other candidates before flipping for Johnson, and six more withheld their votes during the first roll call. Those nine are notable as the GOP\u2019s new rules package, if adopted, will require nine lawmakers to trigger a \u201cmotion to vacate\u201d the speaker\u2019s chair and remove Johnson \u2014 up from one member.",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has railed for weeks against Johnson, cast his vote for Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn. And Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., voted for Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, while Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, voted for Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.",
      "But that\u2019s when Trump began getting involved, making multiple phone calls personally urging the holdouts to rally behind Johnson to enact his agenda. In the middle of his golf game, Trump got on the line with GOP Rep. Nancy Mace who passed the phone to Norman, her South Carolina colleague, the latter said.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Norman, we\u2019ve got the most opportunity we\u2019ve ever had, three houses ... the trifecta.

      "Later, Johnson huddled in the cloakroom just off the floor with Norman and Self, as well as key conservative members who voted for him \u2014 including House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., and past Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, R-Pa.",
      "Trump again was put on the phone with the holdouts, Norman said. The president\u2019s message to the group was \u201cGet united!\u201d according to Johnson.",
      "They emerged roughly 20 minutes later, and Self and Norman switched their votes, both backing the speaker.",

      "The Dawgs were flagged for 15 yards, pushing them back to the Notre Dame 26 where the drive stalled. Runs of 2 and 1 yards preceded an incomplete pass as Georgia was forced to settle for a 41-yard field goal by Peyton Woodring.",

      "There's no telling if Georgia could have scored a touchdown first-and-10 from the 11. And those lost points probably didn't make any difference in Notre Dame's 23-10 win in the College Football Playoff (CFP) quarterfinal game.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:49:28 GMT",
    "summary": "A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.",
      "The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.",
      "\u201cThese footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.",
      "Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 60 feet in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 30-foot predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.",
      "An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.",
      "\u201cScientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\u201d said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world\u2019s most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there\u2019s limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.",
      "The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.",
      "\u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out,\u201d said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. \u201cAlong with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d",
      "The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC\u2019s \u201cDigging for Britain\u201d program next week."

    "summary": "Alcohol is the third leading cause of cancer in the U.S., after tobacco and obesity, according to a new report from the U.S. surgeon general.",
    "story": [
      "Alcoholic drinks should carry cancer risk warning labels, U.S.  Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said in a report Friday.",
      "The report cites a direct link between alcohol consumption and at least seven types of cancer, including of the breast, colorectal, liver and mouth. An estimated 16.4% of total breast cancer cases are linked to drinking alcohol.",
      "There are about 100,000 alcohol-related cancer cases and about 20,000 alcohol-related cancer deaths in the U.S. each year, the report found. Alcohol is the third-leading cause of cancer in the U.S., after tobacco and obesity.",
      "While research has shown a link between alcohol and cancer, \u201cthe majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\u201d Murthy said in a statement.",
      "People who do drink alcohol are likely familiar with the current health warning label, which reads:",
      "GOVERNMENT WARNING:\u00a0(1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.",
      "The current warning \u201chas long informed consumers about the potential risks of the consumption of alcohol. Many lifestyle choices carry potential risks,\u201d Dr. Amanda Berger, senior vice president of Science and Research at the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade organization representing companies that make alcoholic beverages, said in a statement.",
      "She added that the group does \u201cnot recommend that anyone drink to achieve health benefits.\u201d",
      "Can damage from alcohol be reversed?",
      "The new report may be an extra incentive for people doing Dry January or plans to cut back on drinking or quit. The body is able to heal some of alcohol's adverse effects, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhile some damage can be permanent, some can be reversed,\u201d said Dr. Wei Zheng, director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. \u201cCutting down on drinking will certainly reduce risks in the future.\u201d",
      "Murthy said in an interview there\u2019s no \u201cmagic level\u201d of safe alcohol consumption for the entire population. \u201cWhat we do know is that less alcohol consumption means less cancer risk.\u201d",
      "The advisory comes just weeks after another major report found that compared with abstaining from alcohol, moderate drinking was linked to a lower risk of death. But at the same time, scientists found that it also raised the risk of breast cancer.",
      "That report, commissioned by Congress and carried out by a committee from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, reviewed research dating to 2010 to look at the relationship between moderate drinking and a number of outcomes, including death from any cause, death from heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, weight changes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Women in particular are susceptible to alcohol\u2019s effects because they process and metabolize it differently than men, said Dr. Jamie Koprivnikar, an oncologist at Hackensack Meridian John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center\u00a0in New Jersey. \u201cWe know that they are likely to have potential toxicities at lower amounts or doses than men are.\u201d",
      "And a 2023 study found that alcohol-related deaths have risen dramatically among women in recent years.",
      "Alcohol can cause cancer in several ways, including damaging DNA and altering hormone levels, according to the report.",
      "Along with new warning labels, the surgeon general\u2019s report also recommends reassessing the guideline limits for alcohol consumption to account for cancer risk. Current dietary guidelines\u00a0recommend people drink alcohol in moderation, defined as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women.",
      "\u201cEven within the current guideline limits of one drink a day for women, two drinks a day for men, we actually see increased cancer risk, even consuming at those levels,\u201d Murthy said.",
      "Outside experts applauded the idea of adding cancer warning labels to alcoholic drinks.",
      "\u201cDespite decades of compelling evidence of this connection, too many in the public remain unaware of alcohol\u2019s risk,\u201d Dr. Bruce Scott, president of the American Medical Association said in a statement. The report, \u201ccoupled with a push to update the Surgeon General\u2019s health warning label on alcoholic beverages, will bolster awareness, improve health, and save lives.\u201d",
      "Any change to the beverage labels requires congressional authorization.",
      "An update to federal dietary guidelines coming this year is expected to include new recommendations about how much alcohol people should drink.",
      "A report on alcohol consumption conducted by a group within the Department of Health and Human Services is set to be published in the coming weeks. That report will help determine the 2025 dietary guidelines."

      "In 7 \u00bd minutes of body-camera video released by police, Kerley is seen in a gray hoodie standing next to a police vehicle talking to officers. It's unclear what is being said as there's no audio in the first 30 seconds of video.",

    "story": [
      "Since late 2023, around a dozen artificial intelligence Instagram and Facebook accounts created by their parent company, Meta, quietly existed on the platforms. Originally launched alongside a suite of official celebrity AI characters, the AI-driven personalities posted some AI-generated images and were available for chatting over direct messages.",
      "Until Friday, those AI accounts never attracted much attention. When they did, controversy erupted, leading Meta to pull down the accounts and restrict search results for their usernames.",
      "In a statement shared with NBC News, a Meta spokesperson said \u201cThere is confusion\u201d over when the controversial accounts were introduced to the platform.",
      "On Dec. 27, the Financial Times published a story about Meta\u2019s plans to further integrate user-generated AI profiles \u2014 AI profiles that people can create and customize to their liking \u2014 into its social media platforms. Connor Hayes, Meta\u2019s VP of product for generative AI, told the FT the AI characters would \u201cover time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d with \u201cbios and profile pictures\u201d and the ability \u201cto generate and share content powered by AI on the platform.\u201d",
      "In July 2024, Meta scrapped its celebrity AI characters and launched AI Studio, a way for people to create their own AI characters that can also be accessed by other users through the messaging functions on Meta\u2019s social media platforms. The noncelebrity AI characters Meta created in 2023 stayed up, but 404 Media reported that most of them stopped posting content.",
      "In the wake of the Financial Times article, users resurfaced some of the 2023 AI characters, particularly one called \u201cLiv\u201d depicting a \u201cProud Black queer momma\u201d who solicited messages from human users.",
      "When Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah started chatting with \u201cLiv,\u201d she posted a series of screenshots of its responses that included the AI account writing, \u201cMy creators admitted they lacked diverse references,\u201d the supposed racial and gender makeup of the development team behind the chatbot, which it said didn\u2019t include any Black people and what the account claimed to be the name of its developer. Meta has not addressed the authenticity of the AI character\u2019s claims. It is unclear if the name provided by the AI account is a real Meta employee or a fictional character.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re calling me out \u2014 and rightfully so,\u201d the AI account wrote in screenshots shared by Attiah. \u201cMy existence currently perpetuates harm. Ideally, my creators would rebuild me with black creators leading my design \u2014\u00a0then my goal would be supporting queer black community via authentic representation and helpful resources. Does that redemption arc seem possible?\u201d",
      "In addition to Attiah\u2019s posts about \u201cLiv,\u201d other posts on X, Bluesky and Meta\u2019s own platform Threads took issue with the AI character accounts. On Threads, trending topics are summarized in descriptions that are also generated with AI. For the posts about \u201cAI profiles,\u201d Threads\u2019 AI description was, \u201cUsers are criticizing Meta\u2019s new AI-generated profiles on social media platforms, calling them creepy and unnecessary.\u201d",
      "In some posts on Threads that reacted to the discovery of the characters, users urged each other to try to report, block or avoid interacting with the characters to prevent Meta from collecting further training data for its AI models.",
      "In its statement, Meta said that it removed the AI characters because a bug prevented some people from being able to block them.",
      "\u201cThe accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.\u201d",
      "When searching for some of the AI character accounts on Instagram after they were removed, an error message appeared saying \u201cCouldn\u2019t load search results,\u201d meaning that no results appeared for some of the names associated with the AI character accounts.",
      "Despite pulling the company\u2019s own AI characters, there are still many AI chatbots available on Meta platforms that are generated by users. Some of the most popular ones on Instagram are female \u201cgirlfriend\u201d AI characters."

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Boeing said Friday that it had hit several internal targets on safety and quality control despite a series of deadly crashes, near catastrophes and embarrassing incidents that has seen its share price plunge and airlines around the world pull some of its planes.",
    "story": [
      "Boeing said Friday that it had hit several internal targets on safety and quality control despite a series of deadly crashes, near catastrophes and embarrassing incidents that has seen its share price plunge and airlines around the world pull some of its planes.",
      "The company said in a news release that it had made improvements \u201cin multiple areas including safety culture, training, simplifying their processes, and eliminating defects.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes less than a week after the latest deadly crash involving one of its aircraft. In the worst air disaster in South Korean history, 179 people were killed when a Boeing 737-800 belly-landed\u00a0and skidded\u00a0off the runway at Muan International Airport.",
      "Even so, in a section titled \u2018Elevating Safety & Quality Culture,\u2019 Boeing said it has \u201caddressed over 70% of action items in commercial airplanes production based on employee feedback\u201d and implemented key criteria \u201cacross Final Assembly for the 737, 787 and portions of 767 and 777\u201d to \u201cmitigate risk.\u201d",
      "It has nonetheless been a difficult year for the company that \u2014 along with Europe\u2019s Airbus \u2014 exercises a virtual duopoly over the airline market. In early 2024, a crucial fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet, its largest union stopped producing airplanes, and problems with its Starliner space capsule have left two astronauts stranded in orbit.",
      "These incidents came after several fatal crashes involving Boeing jets in recent years, including Boeing planes operated by Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, that led to the various aviation authorities issuing grounding orders against specific Boeing jets.",
      "All of that has combined to strip almost a third of the value off its share price since the end of 2023.",
      "During Boeing\u2019s difficult 2024, whistleblowers from within the company came forward with complaints about shambolic internal processes in the production of its 737 and 787 aircraft.",
      "One of those whistleblowers,\u00a0John Barnett, was found to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at age 62. After his death, his family said his attempts to highlight serious concerns were met with \u201ca culture of concealment\u201d that valued \u201cprofits over safety.\u201d",
      "Since then, the company has changed CEOs with the new chief executive, Robert \u201cKelly\u201d Ortberg, undertaking a massive turnaround plan since he was installed in August. In a letter to employees in October, he stressed the need for a \u201cfundamental culture change,\u201d going further than his recent predecessors in acknowledging the damage to Boeing\u2019s reputation.",
      "\u201cThis is a big ship that will take some time to turn, but when it does, it has the capacity to be great again,\u201d Ortberg said in the letter, according to Reuters.",
      "But just two months later in October, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was opening a three-month review of\u00a0Boeing\u2019s compliance with safety regulations as part of its intensified scrutiny of the company's operations.",
      "Asked by NBC News' Lester Holt whether Boeing was too big to fail, FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said last month that the company had failed \u201cand they\u2019re going through a pretty substantial reset. They have the resources to do this reset and to rebuild in a much higher quality and safer manner.\u201d",
      "But Boeing\u2019s news release highlights the company\u2019s investment in workforce training, with\u00a0\u201cstrengthened training for mechanics and quality inspectors with an enhanced support system,\u201d as well as adding \u201chundreds of hours of new curriculum to training programs\u201d that include \u201cquality proficiency\u201d and \u201cPositive Safety Culture.\u201d",
      "In addition, Boeing said that it is trying to simplify its processes, specifically highlighting the installation plans of its 737 production line, as well as \u201celiminating defects.\u201d\u00a0The 737 aircraft was mentioned when the company said its operation with Spirit AeroSystems had \u201csignificantly reduced defects\u201d in assembling the planes\u2019 fuselages by increasing inspection points. Boeing said it had also \u201cfully implemented\u201d new procedures around the final assembly of its 737 and 787 aircraft that tracks and secures parts \u201cto prevent loss or improper use.\u201d",
      "The timing of Boeing\u2019s statement will not be lost on many in the aerospace industry. The release itself notes both the 53-day strike and the Alaska Airlines incident that kicked off the company\u2019s awful year.",
      "Sunday marks the first anniversary of the near catastrophe aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the company will likely be keen to show its progress in the year since."

    "summary": "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri\u00a0to eavesdrop\u00a0on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn\u2019t seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\u201d Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple\u2019s long-running commitment to\u00a0protect the privacy\u00a0of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn\u2019t acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It\u2019s also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents."

    "summary": "A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson has become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson is well known as the leader of the English far right, inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration.",
      "It has been jarring then, for many Britons to see Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cFree Tommy Robinson!\u201d the billionaire entrepreneur and adviser to President-elect Donald Trump posted to his X social media network Thursday.",
      "Robinson, 42, is serving an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",
      "Widely disliked in Britain, Robinson\u2019s 19% popularity rating is even lower than Musk\u2019s at 26%, according to the latest findings published in October by YouGov, a British polling company.",
      "\u201cBut he will become less fringe if people adopt him \u2014 and that\u2019s the risk you have here,\u201d according to Scott Lucas, a University College Dublin professor specializing in British and American politics. \u201cTommy\u2019s an icon for certain far-right groups \u2014 and Musk knows that.\u201d",
      "This is far from Musk\u2019s first intervention in European politics, and he has increasingly opined on the subject since backing Trump\u2019s election win in November. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has largely supported far-right nationalists, most recently in Germany. Their rise on the continent has coincided with Trump\u2019s second term, teeing up the prospect of transatlantic cooperation among this former political fringe.",
      "It is in Britain, however, where Musk has focused most attention.",
      "In recent months, he has accused Keir Starmer of running a \u201ctyrannical police state\u201d and going \u201cfull Stalin,\u201d a stark contrast to domestic criticism, which has often seen the prime minister accused of being too centrist and selling out his leftist roots.",
      "Musk also predicted Britain would descend into \u201ccivil war\u201d after the August murders of three girls in the northern seaside town of Southport sparked widespread rioting led by the far right. The disorder was partly blamed by both police and politicians on false rumors spread about their alleged killer on X, including by Musk himself.",
      "And on Friday, Musk supported a call for King Charles III to dissolve Parliament, which he technically has the power to do, but in Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchy has not been used against the wishes of a prime minister for almost two centuries",
      "Many treated this as little more than \u201cmuppetry and trolling\u201d as Sunder Katwala, director of the think tank British Future, put it on X.",
      "But Musk's interaction with Robinson has raised more eyebrows. Musk first started replying to Robinson on X in August, but that ramped up significantly this week when he began posting about Britain\u2019s \u201cgrooming gangs\u201d scandal.",
      "Decadelong investigations into gangs in regional towns and cities across the United Kingdom found groups of mostly men had systematically groomed and raped young girls.",
      "While \u201cresearch has found that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white,\u201d according to a 2023 study by the British government, some of these gangs were formed of men of Pakistani heritage, making it the source of outrage among the far right and also Conservative politicians.",
      "\u201cWhy is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?\u201d Musk posted Wednesday, saying he should be \u201cfreed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.\u201d",
      "But Robinson\u2019s October jailing is just his latest encounter with the law.",
      "He was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer, and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "Under the conditions of the order, he was prohibited from contacting the journalist or attending any places where the person lives and works, unless specifically invited for an interview.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the E.U. over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could,\u201d Robinson said in 2016, and he has described Islam as \u201cfascist,\u201d according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate.",
      "He has also hinted at violent retribution. In 2011, he said that the \u201cthe Islamic community will feel the full force of the English Defence League if we see any of our British citizens killed, maimed, or hurt on British soil ever again.\u201d",
      "Robinson is no longer associated with the EDL and has repeatedly stated that he is not racist or Islamophobic.",
      "In addition to his support for Robinson, Musk has also professed support for Nigel Farage, the British Trump ally who leads the anti-immigration Reform UK party. Farage said that Musk has given \u201cserious thought\u201d to making a donation to his political group. While certainly hard right, Reform, which has five parliamentary lawmakers, is considered a far more mainstream force than Robinson.",
      "Some pundits have suggested that Musk\u2019s endorsement of Robinson could harm Farage, who has sought to distance himself from the former EDL man. But can Musk\u2019s apparent fixation with British and European politics actually make a difference there?",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the question,\u201d said Lucas at University College Dublin, who added that he believed that renewed focus on immigration \u2014 a democratic trend sweeping Europe \u2014 has at least opened the door.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is that British politics has already been damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s an opportunity for him to move the needle.\u201d"

      "His twin brother, Ali, was fighting for his life in intensive care, officials at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told NBC News on Wednesday, after Batran and his wife woke up to find the two infants, who were born premature, lying motionless in their tent days ago.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground on Sunday, Batran recounted how he woke to the sounds of his wife desperately trying to rouse their newborn twins as they lay motionless in the cold tent \u2014 now home to the family of eight after they had fled from northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahia.They raced Jumaa and Ali to the Al-Aqsa hospital, but it was too late for baby Jumaa, Batran said. \u201cHe was frozen.\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t protect my children. I watched them die in front of my eyes,\u201d Batran said, describing how he had slept without a blanket at night, using everything the family had to keep his children warm.",
      "Temperatures in Gaza dropped below 45 degrees Fahrenheit at night this week, while heavy rains flooded more than 1,500 tents sheltering displaced families across the enclave, according to Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense agency.Local health officials say more than 45,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in the enclave, where children not only confront the daily reality of Israeli attacks, but have also been displaced from their homes amid an almost complete destruction of services.",
      "Winter weather has added another deadly challenge.",
      "\u201cIt is so cold now in winter that ... there have been three newborn deaths just in the last week because of the tents and the lack of foods available for them unfortunately,\u201d Dr. Mimi Sayed, an American emergency physician volunteering at the Al-Aqsa hospital, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNothing compares to what\u2019s happening in\u00a0Gaza,\u201d said Sayed.",
      "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, sounded the alarm Friday, warning they expected more infants to be affected by hypothermia. Speaking in a voice recording published by MSF in a post on X, Dr. Mohammad Abu Tayyem, a pediatrician at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, said that doctors were seeing an \"increased number of children with respiratory infections like acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections and even bronchial asthma exacerbations.\"",
      "And, he said, \u201cdue to the increased number of premature babies and the low-birth-weight babies in this period in the ICU, we\u2019re expecting more babies to come to our ER complaining from hypothermia\" as he attributed their suffering to the cold weather and poor conditions children are being forced to live in amid Israel's offensive.",
      "Babies are unable to regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults can, making them particularly vulnerable to cold weather without adequate shelter and warm clothing \u2014 both in short supply.",
      "Asked to respond to reports of infants displaced by Israel\u2019s assault dying from the cold weather, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters the military had looked into those reports but could not find any \u201cinformation we can work with\u201d from sources who were \u201cnot Hamas-related.\u201d\u201cThe reality of war is a tough thing and obviously that\u2019s part of why we don\u2019t start wars,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that hostages taken captive during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack were also experiencing winter in Gaza. He said Israeli officials were working to bring \u201cequipment for the winter\u201d into the enclave, but did not elaborate on those efforts.",

      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014\u00a0Vehicle attacks are a rising global terror threat that can be difficult to prevent \u2014 but the deadly assault on New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans shows how a city\u2019s efforts to protect a heavily crowded and vulnerable area can fall short, experts said.",
      "New Orleans failed to deploy anti-vehicle barriers that the city had owned for years ahead of the attack, and other barriers, known as bollards, had recently been removed because they were malfunctioning and needed to be replaced.",
      "The city was warned of the potential danger more than five years ago, when a corporate intelligence firm urged local authorities to fix the faulty bollard system. The 2019 report by Interfor International, excerpts of which were obtained by NBC News and first reported by The New York Times, cautioned that a vehicle ramming incident was one of the most likely potential terrorist attacks that could strike the French Quarter.",
      "\u201cNew Orleans does have mobile vehicle barriers that are designed to block streets and sidewalks,\u201d Don Aviv, CEO of Interfor International, told NBC News on Friday. \u201cThe fact that they didn\u2019t cover this area seems ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Aviv believes New Orleans police should have deployed their highest possible level of security, as they do during Mardi Gras, for an event like New Year\u2019s Eve that draws a packed crowd to Bourbon Street.",
      "The city has highly effective steel Archer vehicle barriers, but did not set them out on Bourbon Street\u2019s sidewalks until a day after the attack.",
      "In a statement on Friday afternoon, Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser called it \u201ca complete failure of responsibility to keep the city safe, from the top down, by not having those barriers in place or even having knowledge of them.\u201d",
      "New Orleans officials have defended the city\u2019s security on New Year\u2019s Eve, noting that police had installed temporary barriers, vehicles and law enforcement personnel throughout the French Quarter. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick described the attacker, who drove a pickup truck around a police car and then careened down the sidewalk on Bourbon Street, as \u201ca terrorist\u201d who was \u201chell-bent on destruction.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis man was going to do his best, and if it hadn\u2019t been on Bourbon, he was going to go somewhere else,\u201d she said.",
      "Bourbon Street reopened Thursday with a large law enforcement presence and additional anti-vehicle protections, including the Archer barriers. Later that night, those new measures were visible, but at least two side streets leading to Bourbon did not appear to be fully sealed off and had only lightweight bicycle rack-style barricades.",
      "In response to questions, the New Orleans Police Department said it would not detail its security measures, but \u201cwe continuously evaluate and adjust these plans to keep the community safe.\u201d",
      "The carnage that unfolded on Bourbon Street is part of an international pattern that is not new but has proven persistently difficult to stop. Vehicle attacks have increased globally in recent years, counterterrorism and security experts said, as assailants can easily \u2014\u00a0and legally \u2014\u00a0access vehicles and blend into traffic until the moment they strike, when they can unleash mass violence targeting large crowds without special training.",
      "The deadliest incident was in 2016 in Nice, France, when a truck driver plowed into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, killing more than 80 people; ISIS claimed responsibility. The following year, an Islamic extremist in a rental truck rampaged through a pedestrian and cycling path in Manhattan, killing eight people. Last month, a man with anti-Islamic and anti-immigration views rammed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing five people and injuring hundreds more.",
      "Over the past decade, this grim spate of attacks has led cities, including New Orleans, to install new security barriers in areas with heavy pedestrian traffic. Options include permanent concrete blocks, metal bollards that can retract to let emergency vehicles through, temporary metal barricades, police vehicles, and trucks filled with sand. All can be effective \u2014 and all have the potential to fail if there\u2019s even a small gap.",
      "\u201cIt just takes one point of failure for a vehicle to get around and cause destruction,\u201d said Ryan Houser, whose 2022 study in the British Medical Journal found that out of the 257 recorded terror attacks involving a vehicle from 1970 to 2019, 71% took place in the last six years the research examined.",
      "\u201cBy 2016, vehicle attacks were the most lethal form of attack comprising just over half of all terrorism-related deaths in that year,\u201d according to the study by Houser, who is a biodefense doctoral student and terrorism researcher at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government.",
      "The most effective way to halt the attacks would be to stop them in advance, but this is also challenging because perpetrators are often radicalized online and can act quietly and alone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult in modern society to get a vehicle,\u201d said Brian Michael Jenkins, director of the National Transportation Security Center at the Mineta Transportation Institute, a research and training organization. \u201cIt can be turned into a deadly weapon, and the target is just around the corner.\u201d",
      "While protecting large crowds of pedestrians is difficult, \u201cit can be done,\u201d Jenkins said, citing the annual New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop in New York City that draws hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "The 2016 Nice attack spurred New Orleans to install the bollards on Bourbon Street the following year, but they soon malfunctioned. In its 2019 security report for the French Quarter Management District, a tourism and public safety group, Interfor International said it had \u201creceived conflicting explanations as to why the existing bollard system is rarely used.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome residents and business owners reported that beads frequently fall into the tracks rendering the devices temporarily inoperable,\u201d the report continued. \u201cOthers claim there are not enough personnel available to deploy them on the existing schedule.\u201d",
      "The system should be fixed or improved \u201cimmediately,\u201d the report said.",
      "The French Quarter Management District did not immediately comment on the report.",
      "Heald, the company that made bollards, said in a statement: \"Like any operational product, it is vital to undertake daily operational and ongoing maintenance of those products to ensure the product operates effectively.\"",
      "By the time Interfor's security recommendation became public, the construction to replace the bollards was underway \u2014\u00a0but it was too late.",
      "At about 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a man inspired by ISIS drove onto a sidewalk and around a police car and other temporary barriers and slammed a rented pickup truck into people celebrating New Year\u2019s on Bourbon Street, authorities said. The man then opened fire on police, wounding two officers before dying in the shootout. At least 14 people were killed and dozens more were injured.",
      "Asked hours later whether the police had considered the possibility of a driver mounting the sidewalk on Bourbon Street, Capt. Lejon Roberts replied: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something we expected to account for.\u201d",
      "When a reporter pressed Roberts on the point, Gov. Jeff Landry jumped in.",
      "\u201cThis is evil, and that guy could have easily gone down the sidewalk of Canal Street, where there were a ton of pedestrians on there as well,\u201d Landry said. He added, \u201cWhere there are defects in this system, we are going to be transparent and we are going to address them with the city and make sure that we fill those gaps as best we can.\u201d",
      "Joseph Hauss, president Gibraltar Perimeter Security, which manufactured steel bollards used to harden the Manhattan waterfront path where the 2017 attack occurred, as well as the Las Vegas Strip, was appalled to hear that the city hadn\u2019t accounted for a vehicle crossing onto the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cThis is a letdown for our industry,\u201d he texted a colleague when he heard about the attack. He added in an interview: \u201cBourbon Street was protected \u2014 it just wasn\u2019t protected properly.\u201d",
      "While nothing is foolproof, Hauss said that functioning bollards, which cost $8,000 to $10,000 apiece, would have at least slowed the driver.",
      "\u201cThe truck could have jumped the bollard, but there\u2019s no doubt it would not have gone as far as it did,\u201d he said.",
      "The sense of betrayal was echoed by Bourbon Street workers as they returned to their jobs this week.",
      "\u201cI think the city failed us,\u201d said Wayne Jones, 50, a security guard at a bar on Bourbon Street.",
      "He believes the area should have been better secured on New Year\u2019s Eve ahead of the attack. The steel Archer barriers that the city installed on the sidewalks on Bourbon Street on Thursday, made by Meridian Rapid Defense Group, would have been useful on the night the street was packed with New Year\u2019s revelers.",
      "\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t that on the sidewalk?\u201d Jones asked. \u201cThat would have slowed him down,\u201d he added of the attacker.",
      "Jones and other local workers also questioned the decision to replace the street\u2019s long-malfunctioning security bollards during the winter, which is the busiest time for the French Quarter.",
      "\u201cIt seems worse than poor planning,\u201d said Rory Windhorst, who works at a business on Bourbon Street near the site of the attack. He noted that the city was pouring money into preparing for the Super Bowl in February, and he wondered whether there had been a \u201cgross miscalculation\u201d in how the resources were used.",
      "The city released a statement Thursday saying it \u201cis committed to ensuring the safety and functionality of Bourbon Street\u201d and that the bollard replacement is part of that commitment.",
      "Laura Strickler reported from Washington, Daniella Silva reported from New York and Jesse Kirsch and Bracey Harris reported from New Orleans."

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "Living in Los Angeles has proven to be beneficial in more ways than one for Luke Wilson.",
      "Not only has the actor called LA his home for more than two decades, but it\u2019s also provided plenty of fodder for his latest role as JD Campbell in the new Netflix series \u201cNo Good Deed.\u201d Campbell is a washed-up soap star, or, as Wilson puts it, \u201ca not-very-smart guy.\u201d",
      "\"For me, it was funny to play an empty-headed soap opera actor. I heard the description of the character, and it just started making me laugh just thinking of the ideas you could bring to it,\" Wilson tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "\"I mean, just living in LA, you come across successful actors and people that want to be successful actors, and there's all kinds of material for it,\" he explains.",
      "Wilson is no stranger to the Hollywood-style hijinx that play out in \"No Good Deed,\" a dark comedy that revolves around a group of scheming LA house hunters hoping to score a home being sold by Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano), a grieving couple with some surprising secrets of their own.",

      "In the Season 6 finale, Mel gets a opportunity at motherhood when one of her clients at the birthing center calls and says the couple who was supposed to adopt her unborn child might be backing out. She then says she wants Mel and Jack to have her child.",

      "Since \"Virgin River\" is based off a book series, some fans are turning to the books for clues about Charmaine's fate. Since Charmaine doesn't die in the books, killing her off on the show would be a bold move, but not beyond this dramatic show.",

    "summary": "South Korean authorities moved Friday to execute an unprecedented arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to declare martial law last month.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean authorities tried and failed Friday to carry out an unprecedented arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to declare martial law in a dramatic standoff at the presidential residence where Yoon has been staying since he was impeached last month.",
      "Investigators and police officers began leaving Yoon\u2019s official residence in central Seoul around 1:30 p.m. local time (11:30 p.m. Thursday ET), more than five hours after they first passed through the steel gates.",
      "They said they had suspended the execution of the arrest warrant for the day \u201cbecause we have concluded that it is impossible to execute it today,\u201d citing safety concerns as they were blocked by Yoon\u2019s presidential security detail.",
      "\u201cIt is to our extreme regret that the suspect did not respond to the legal proceedings,\u201d a joint team of investigators said in a statement.",
      "The warrant, which a court issued on Tuesday, does not expire until Monday and officials could try to execute it again before then.",
      "They are seeking to detain Yoon for questioning on possible charges of insurrection, one of the few crimes for which South Korean presidents do not have immunity. Officials would then have to apply for a separate court warrant in order to formally indict and continue to hold him.",
      "Thousands of police officers arrived at the compound on Friday, a month to the day after Yoon\u2019s short-lived declaration of martial law.",
      "In addition to Yoon\u2019s security detail, they faced a growing crowd of Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters outside the residence who were trying to form a \u201chuman shield\u201d to protect him from arrest, some of whom waved American flags in a show of support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.",
      "Inside the compound, investigators said, they faced resistance from about 200 security service agents and soldiers who were \u201cguarding the area in layers.\u201d They said Yoon\u2019s lawyers reiterated their position that the warrant was illegal and that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading the joint investigation team, does not have authority over the police.",
      "The Presidential Security Service, which has also blocked investigators from searching Yoon\u2019s office and residence in recent weeks, told NBC News that it was required by law to protect the president, including from anyone entering the premises to execute warrants.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Investigation Headquarters said Friday afternoon that presidential security chief Park Jong-joon had been summoned for questioning \u201cover obstruction of special official duties.\u201d",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party criticized the actions of the presidential security detail and said Choi Sang-mok, South Korea\u2019s second acting president since Yoon\u2019s impeachment on Dec. 14, should take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to ensure Yoon\u2019s arrest.",
      "Anyone who stands in the way of Yoon\u2019s arrest \u201cshould be considered accomplices in the insurrection,\u201d said Park Chan-dae, the party\u2019s floor leader.",
      "Though Yoon, 64, is not the first South Korean president to be impeached, he would be the East Asian democracy\u2019s first sitting president to be arrested. He has been suspended from presidential duties since his impeachment pending a Constitutional Court trial to determine whether it should be upheld.",
      "The court, which held a second hearing Friday, said that oral arguments would begin Jan. 14. The court has 180 days to make a ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment, which if confirmed would trigger a presidential by-election within 60 days.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said Friday that he is \u201cready to abide by the law as long as it is the rightful due process of law.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament.",
      "In a surprise late-night address on Dec. 3, he accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea and declared emergency martial law, which included a ban on all political activity.",
      "He lifted the order about six hours later after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law declaration, he has repeatedly defied summonses to appear for questioning in the criminal investigation, saying it was within his power as president to issue the order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980.",
      "The episode has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule but has since transitioned into one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released Dec. 13 found Yoon had an approval rating of 11%, down from 19% before the martial law declaration.",
      "Yoon still has some supporters, however, thousands of whom have gathered outside the presidential residence in recent days. Some waving American flags argued that Yoon and his conservative People Power Party are more supportive of the U.S. alliance than the liberal Democratic Party, which they accused of being friendlier toward China and North Korea.",
      "Others held signs adopting a slogan associated with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud in 2020, \u201cStop the Steal.\u201d",
      "Kang Minwoo, a 30-year-old office worker, said the suspension of the arrest warrant on Friday was a victory for Yoon supporters like him.",
      "\u201cWe need to continue to protect the president because it is not over yet,\u201d said Kang, whose voice was hoarse from shouting at the protest all night. \u201cI am planning to stay here over the weekend.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the protesters late Wednesday, Yoon said he had been watching their efforts via YouTube.",
      "\u201cThank you so much and I feel sad,\u201d he wrote, adding that he worried for their health in the bitterly cold weather.",
      "Yoon, who was once the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, said South Korea was in \u201cdanger\u201d because of efforts by \u201canti-state forces\u201d inside and outside the country \u201cto steal the sovereignty of this nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will fight until the end standing with you to protect our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country belongs to each and every person in South Korea and not a government or a party.\u201d",
      "The Democratic Party said Yoon\u2019s message to supporters was \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates that he remains trapped in his delusions.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost concerning is his incitement of extreme conflict and chaos among his supporters through this message,\u201d Cho Seung-rae, the party\u2019s chief spokesperson, said Thursday. \u201cAs if orchestrating a rebellion was not enough, he is now stirring his followers to provoke extreme clashes and disorder.\u201d",
      "State media in North Korea, which technically remains at war with the South, said Friday that the crisis in South Korea had resulted in \u201cparalysis of its state administration and spiraling socio-political confusion.\u201d",
      "While Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was initially acting president after Yoon\u2019s impeachment, he was in the job for less than two weeks before he was also impeached\u00a0on Dec. 27 after he refused to immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies on the Constitutional Court.",
      "Choi, the former deputy prime minister and minister of economy and finance, became the new acting president two days before a\u00a0Jeju Air plane crashed\u00a0in the southwest city of Muan, killing 179 of the 181 people on board in the world\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster of 2024.",
      "Stella Kim, Steve Patterson, Stephanie Fuerte and Beomsu Jo reported from Seoul and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

      "Holding the motionless body of his newborn baby wrapped in a blanket, Yahya Al-Batran imagines what his son, Jumaa, would say if he could speak.",
      "\u201cI left you for God, Daddy,\u201d Batran says as Jumaa, eyes open and dressed in a sweater too big for his frail body, lies still in his arms.",
      "Jumaa is one of at least five children to have succumbed to the bitter cold and difficult conditions consuming Gaza this winter amid Israel\u2019s deadly offensive in the Palestinian enclave, according to local health officials.",
      "His twin brother, Ali, was fighting for his life in intensive care, officials at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told NBC News on Wednesday, after Batran and his wife woke up to find the two infants, who were born premature, lying motionless in their tent days ago.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground on Sunday, Batran recounted how he woke to the sounds of his wife desperately trying to rouse their newborn twins as they lay motionless in the cold tent \u2014 now home to the family of eight after they had fled from northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahia.They raced Jumaa and Ali to the Al-Aqsa hospital, but it was too late for baby Jumaa, Batran said. \u201cHe was frozen.\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t protect my children. I watched them die in front of my eyes,\u201d Batran said, describing how he had slept without a blanket at night, using everything the family had to keep his children warm.",
      "Temperatures in Gaza dropped below 45 degrees Fahrenheit at night this week, while heavy rains flooded more than 1,500 tents sheltering displaced families across the enclave, according to Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense agency.Local health officials say more than 45,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in the enclave, where children not only confront the daily reality of Israeli attacks, but have also been displaced from their homes amid an almost complete destruction of services.",
      "Winter weather has added another deadly challenge.",
      "\u201cIt is so cold now in winter that ... there have been three newborn deaths just in the last week because of the tents and the lack of foods available for them unfortunately,\u201d Dr. Mimi Sayed, an American emergency physician volunteering at the Al-Aqsa hospital, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNothing compares to what\u2019s happening in\u00a0Gaza,\u201d said Sayed.",
      "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, sounded the alarm Friday, warning they expected more infants to be affected by hypothermia. Speaking in a voice recording published by MSF in a post on X, Dr. Mohammad Abu Tayyem, a pediatrician at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, said that doctors were seeing an \"increased number of children with respiratory infections like acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections and even bronchial asthma exacerbations.\"",
      "And, he said, \u201cdue to the increased number of premature babies and the low-birth-weight babies in this period in the ICU, we\u2019re expecting more babies to come to our ER complaining from hypothermia\" as he attributed their suffering to the cold weather and poor conditions children are being forced to live in amid Israel's offensive.",
      "Babies are unable to regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults can, making them particularly vulnerable to cold weather without adequate shelter and warm clothing \u2014 both in short supply.",
      "Asked to respond to reports of infants displaced by Israel\u2019s assault dying from the cold weather, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters the military had looked into those reports but could not find any \u201cinformation we can work with\u201d from sources who were \u201cnot Hamas-related.\u201d\u201cThe reality of war is a tough thing and obviously that\u2019s part of why we don\u2019t start wars,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that hostages taken captive during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack were also experiencing winter in Gaza. He said Israeli officials were working to bring \u201cequipment for the winter\u201d into the enclave, but did not elaborate on those efforts.",
      "Meanwhile, video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed families across a tent encampment in Khan Younis trying to shovel and sweep dirty rainwater from their tents, while others gathered around a soup kitchen in the rain, holding out pots and pans and crying out for warm food.",
      "\u201cWe had a wonderful life, but look at how we have become,\u201d said 11-year-old Marwan Amer El-Akhres, who was helping his family try to move water away from their tent. \u201cWe have become so humiliated.\"",
      "\u201cIt is very hard and cold. It\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said.",
      "Recalling a time when his family, displaced from Rafah, had been able to sit safe and warm in their home \u201cenjoying the warm of winter,\u201d he said: \u201cNow, look at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs this a life?\u201d"

      "Concerns are growing for the safety of a prominent hospital director in Gaza who was taken into Israeli custody after the Israel Defense Forces raided the site, detained scores of people and forced the closure of one of the last functioning medical facilities in the enclave's north.",
      "Video captured outside Kamal Adwan Hospital and verified by NBC News shows its director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, wearing a white medical overcoat and walking alone toward a military vehicle. The street is strewn with rubble and the buildings around him appear destroyed, the video shared widely on social media shows.",
      "While it isn't clear exactly when the video was shot, the Israeli military confirmed Monday that it had detained and interrogated Abu Safiya. He was being held as a \"suspect\" and being questioned over \"potential involvement in terrorist activity,\" IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said in a post on X.",
      "Before his detention, Abu Safiya, a pediatrician, repeatedly warned about the IDF's raid on the hospital and how it endangered patients, including premature babies.",
      "On Friday, he posted video on his Instagram account showing a quadcopter dropping a bomb a few yards from Kamal Adwan Hospital, with the bomb exploding with a loud bang before sending plumes of smoke into the air.",
      "On Friday, video geolocated by NBC News to the area around the hospital showed a crowd of men stripped down to minimal clothing walking in a line with their hands raised. Separately, NBC News' crew on the ground in Gaza captured video of a blaze tearing through several units at the hospital on the same day. In it, people could be seen racing to try to douse the flames with buckets of water, while others sifted through the rubble.",
      "Shoshani previously said there was no connection between the fire and the IDF's activities at the site.",
      "Since Friday, there has been no sign of Abu Safiya, with international organizations, including the World Health Organization, sounding the alarm and demanding his release.",
      "\"Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and the health system is under severe threat,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday in a statement on X, adding that Kamal Adwan was forced to go out of service following the IDF's raid.",
      "\"We call for his immediate release,\" Ghebreyesus said, while noting that Abu Safiya\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts are unknown.\u201d",
      "Hospitals and medical workers are considered protected under international law, which states that they must never become targets in warfare.",
      "Asked to confirm Abu Safiya\u2019s whereabouts and why he was detained, the IDF declined to respond.",
      "The IDF alleged that Kamal Adwan had been used as a \"Hamas command center.\" More than 240 people were detained over the weekend, all of them \u201cterrorists,\u201d it added in a statement.",
      "Sharing a photo of Abu Safiya, over the weekend, the international human rights group Amnesty International said it was \"extremely concerned over the fate & wellbeing\" of the medical director.",
      "\"He must be released immediately and unconditionally,\" the organization said in a statement posted on X.",
      "Ghebreyesus said critical patients had been moved out of Kamal Adwan to the nearby Indonesian Hospital, which he noted was \"itself out of function.\"",
      "He said WHO workers on the ground and partnering groups were able to deliver basic medical and hygiene supplies, as well as water Monday to the Indonesian Hospital, in addition to transferring 10 critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital, which has been heavily bombed and raided by Israeli forces repeatedly throughout the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "But Ghebreyesus said that at least four patients were detained during WHO's efforts. \"We urge Israel to ensure their health care needs and rights are upheld,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the WHO director-general noted that multiple other hospitals in Gaza had also been attacked over the past several days.",
      "The IDF said it has been \u201cwell documented that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers\u201d for its operations and pointed to weapons and tunnel systems found at and around hospitals. It also pointed to the alleged confession of former Kamal Adwan Hospital Director Ahmad Kahalot, whom the IDF detained last year and said had confessed to being a senior Hamas member.",
      "Local health officials vehemently dispute claims that medical centers are used by Hamas or other militants. NBC News was not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s claims.",
      "Israeli forces' repeated attacks on hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza have left the enclave's health care system decimated amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, with most facilities damaged or destroyed in Israel's more than a yearlong military offensive.",
      "\"If a hospital has been reduced to a bombed-out shell, it would cease to be protected, but otherwise a hospital, whether immediately used or not, is presumptively protected as an important civilian institution,\" Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, previously told NBC News. \"It can be attacked only if actively used for military purposes, and even then, only if the civilian harm is not disproportionate.\"",
      "The Illinois-based nonprofit organization MedGlobal was also among those to condemn the IDF's attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital, calling it a \"brutal violation of a protected medical space\" as it echoed calls for Abu Safiya's release.",

      "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
      "After a year of significant gains for Russia, looming large is the presidency of Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war in \u201ca single day\u201d \u2014 even if he has indicated that he is in part sympathetic to Moscow\u2019s arguments and has remained skeptical of promising open-ended military aid to Kyiv.",
      "Some experts believe that, for this reason, it\u2019s likely that Ukraine, and Europe, will need to prepare for a prolonged war.",
      "\u201cTrump, with his unpredictable policy on military support for Kyiv and on how to end the war, will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Justyna Gotkowska, the deputy director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a think tank based in Warsaw, said in an op-ed last week.",
      "After more than 1,000 days of war, Ukraine is running short on manpower while the Kremlin has stepped up bombings of cities and infrastructure, launching missiles, drones and artillery rounds at civilian targets.",
      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

      "LONDON \u2014A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson is well known as the leader of the English far right, inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration.",
      "It has been jarring then, for many Britons to see Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cFree Tommy Robinson!\u201d the billionaire entrepreneur and adviser to President-elect Donald Trump posted to his X social media network Thursday.",
      "Robinson, 42, is serving an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",
      "Widely disliked in Britain, Robinson\u2019s 19% popularity rating is even lower than Musk\u2019s at 26%, according to the latest findings published in October by YouGov, a British polling company.",
      "\u201cBut he will become less fringe if people adopt him \u2014 and that\u2019s the risk you have here,\u201d according to Scott Lucas, a University College Dublin professor specializing in British and American politics. \u201cTommy\u2019s an icon for certain far-right groups \u2014 and Musk knows that.\u201d",
      "This is far from Musk\u2019s first intervention in European politics, and he has increasingly opined on the subject since backing Trump\u2019s election win in November. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has largely supported far-right nationalists, most recently in Germany. Their rise on the continent has coincided with Trump\u2019s second term, teeing up the prospect of transatlantic cooperation among this former political fringe.",
      "It is in Britain, however, where Musk has focused most attention.",
      "In recent months, he has accused Keir Starmer of running a \u201ctyrannical police state\u201d and going \u201cfull Stalin,\u201d a stark contrast to domestic criticism, which has often seen the prime minister accused of being too centrist and selling out his leftist roots.",
      "Musk also predicted Britain would descend into \u201ccivil war\u201d after the August murders of three girls in the northern seaside town of Southport sparked widespread rioting led by the far right. The disorder was partly blamed by both police and politicians on false rumors spread about their alleged killer on X, including by Musk himself.",
      "And on Friday, Musk supported a call for King Charles III to dissolve Parliament, which he technically has the power to do, but in Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchy has not been used against the wishes of a prime minister for almost two centuries",
      "Many treated this as little more than \u201cmuppetry and trolling\u201d as Sunder Katwala, director of the think tank British Future, put it on X.",
      "But Musk's interaction with Robinson has raised more eyebrows. Musk first started replying to Robinson on X in August, but that ramped up significantly this week when he began posting about Britain\u2019s \u201cgrooming gangs\u201d scandal.",
      "Decadelong investigations into gangs in regional towns and cities across the United Kingdom found groups of mostly men had systematically groomed and raped young girls.",
      "While \u201cresearch has found that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white,\u201d according to a 2023 study by the British government, some of these gangs were formed of men of Pakistani heritage, making it the source of outrage among the far right and also Conservative politicians.",
      "\u201cWhy is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?\u201d Musk posted Wednesday, saying he should be \u201cfreed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.\u201d",
      "But Robinson\u2019s October jailing is just his latest encounter with the law.",
      "He was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer, and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "Under the conditions of the order, he was prohibited from contacting the journalist or attending any places where the person lives and works, unless specifically invited for an interview.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the E.U. over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could,\u201d Robinson said in 2016, and he has described Islam as \u201cfascist,\u201d according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate.",
      "He has also hinted at violent retribution. In 2011, he said that the \u201cthe Islamic community will feel the full force of the English Defence League if we see any of our British citizens killed, maimed, or hurt on British soil ever again.\u201d",
      "Robinson is no longer associated with the EDL and has repeatedly stated that he is not racist or Islamophobic.",
      "In addition to his support for Robinson, Musk has also professed support for Nigel Farage, the British Trump ally who leads the anti-immigration Reform UK party. Farage said that Musk has given \u201cserious thought\u201d to making a donation to his political group. While certainly hard right, Reform, which has five parliamentary lawmakers, is considered a far more mainstream force than Robinson.",
      "Some pundits have suggested that Musk\u2019s endorsement of Robinson could harm Farage, who has sought to distance himself from the former EDL man. But can Musk\u2019s apparent fixation with British and European politics actually make a difference there?",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the question,\u201d said Lucas at University College Dublin, who added that he believed that renewed focus on immigration \u2014 a democratic trend sweeping Europe \u2014 has at least opened the door.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is that British politics has already been damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s an opportunity for him to move the needle.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden said Friday that he has decided to block a $15 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, capping off a yearlong business saga that drifted into election politics.",
      "A national security review by a Treasury Department committee\u00a0failed to reach\u00a0a consensus on the deal last month and deferred the final decision to the president. NBC News had reported in September that Biden\u00a0was preparing\u00a0to block the takeover.",
      "The president, who leaves office in little more than two weeks, faced a challenging political calculus over the fate of the iconic Pittsburgh-based firm: Allowing a foreign entity with far greater resources to take it over could put the business on stabler financial footing, while keeping U.S. Steel in American hands risked the company\u2019s survival under intense foreign competition. But the deal was opposed by a powerful steelworkers union.",
      "\"As I have said many times, steel production \u2014 and the steel workers who produce it \u2014 are the backbone of our nation,\" Biden said in a statement.\u00a0\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "President-Elect Donald Trump had also voiced opposition to the takeover proposal during the 2024 presidential campaign. A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.",
      "U.S. Steel's stock fell more than 6% Friday.",
      "In a joint statement, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel condemned Biden's decision, saying it \"reflects a clear violation of due process and the law.\" The companies also hinted at taking legal action.",
      "\"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden\u2019s political agenda,\" the statement said. \"The President\u2019s statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision. Following President Biden\u2019s decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "Later Friday, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt released a statement ripping Biden, calling the president's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk. The Chinese Communist Party leaders in Beijing are dancing in the streets. And Biden did it all while refusing to even meet with us to learn the facts,\" he wrote in the statement. \"We intend to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\"",
      "The roughly 11,000-worker company, founded in 1901, has dwindled  since its heyday, when it employed a peak of roughly 340,000 during World War II. Its share price has barely edged higher since the 1990s as cheaper steel production abroad ramped up, especially in Asia.",
      "When reached for comment Thursday night, a spokesperson for U.S. Steel referred to a previous statement, saying that the deal \"enhances U.S. national and economic security through investment in manufacturing and innovation,\" going on to argue that the transaction would \"combat the competitive threat from China.\"",
      "\"It is the best way, by far, to ensure that U. S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\"It is our hope that President Biden will do the right thing and adhere to the law by approving a transaction that so clearly enhances U.S. national and economic security.\"",
      "Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "United Steelworkers, the union representing many of the company\u2019s employees, hailed the announcement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for President Biden\u2019s willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re confident that with responsible management, U.S. Steel will continue to support good jobs, healthy communities and robust national and economic security well into the future.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro issued a separate statement calling on U.S. Steel to continue to continue to prioritize protecting jobs in the western part of the state.",
      "\u201cThis matter is far from over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must find a long-term solution that protects the future of steelmaking in Western Pennsylvania and the workers who built U.S. Steel and built this country.\u201d",
      "The potential blocking of the deal had raised concerns that it could harm U.S. relations with Japan, a key U.S. ally and the country\u2019s largest foreign investor.",
      "There was no immediate comment from officials in Japan, where Friday was a bank holiday. Japanese government officials have previously declined to comment on matters concerning the management of individual companies but said it is essential for the U.S. and Japan to strengthen economic relations, \u201cincluding the expansion of mutual investment.\u201d",
      "American and international business groups have also criticized what they say is the politicization of the deal.",
      "The proposed acquisition drew controversy almost as soon as it was announced in December 2023, with Biden saying in a statement that month that it \u201cappears to deserve serious scrutiny in terms of its potential impact on national security and supply chain reliability.\u201d",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, both campaigned against the proposed acquisition, saying U.S. Steel should remain American-owned.",
      "Trump said in December that he would block the acquisition and revive U.S. Steel through a combination of tax incentives and tariffs.",
      "Nippon Steel tried to assuage politicians' concerns, saying in a statement in September that U.S. Steel would remain an American company owned by Nippon Steel North America. Nippon Steel also said that Americans would make up the majority of the board of directors of U.S. Steel, and that the American company, under its new ownership, would stay headquartered in Pittsburgh.",

      "A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.",
      "The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.",
      "\u201cThese footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.",
      "Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 60 feet in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 30-foot predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.",
      "An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.",
      "\u201cScientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\u201d said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world\u2019s most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there\u2019s limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.",
      "The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.",
      "\u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out,\u201d said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. \u201cAlong with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d",
      "The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC\u2019s \u201cDigging for Britain\u201d program next week."

      "Five-time Olympic champion Hungarian gymnast Agnes Keleti, the world\u2019s oldest living Olympic gold medalist and a survivor of the persecution of Jews in World War II, died at the age of 103 on Thursday, the Hungarian Olympic Committee said.",
      "Born as Agnes Klein in Budapest on Jan. 9, 1921, Keleti joined the National Gymnastics Association in 1938 and won her first Hungarian championship in 1940, only to be banned from all sports activities that year because of her Jewish origin.",
      "\u201cAgnes Keleti is the greatest gymnast produced by Hungary, but one whose life and career were intertwined with the politics of her country and her religion,\u201d the International Olympic Committee said in a profile on its website.",

      "She won her first gold at the Helsinki games in 1952 aged 31, when most gymnasts had long been retired, the HOC said.",
      "Keleti reached the peak of her career in Melbourne in 1956, where she won four gold medals and became the oldest female gymnast to win gold, the HOC said. A year later Keleti settled in Israel, where she married and had two children.",
      "Her 10 Olympic medals, including five golds, rank\u00a0Keleti\u00a0as the second most successful Hungarian athlete of all time, the HOC said. She has also received multiple Hungarian state awards."

      "The Iranian embassy in Rome later said Sala was being given all the humanitarian care necessary, and for the first time, linked her case to that of an Iranian national, who was arrested last month in Milan at the request of the United States.",
      "Italian media have reported that Sala is in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell with a neon light left on night and day. Her glasses have been confiscated and she has had hardly any contact with the outside world.",

      "Italian designer Rosita Missoni, co-founder of the eponymous fashion house known for its bright and patterned styles, has died at the age of 93, the family-owned company said on Thursday.",
      "A Missoni statement said Rosita \u201cpassed away peacefully on January 1, 2025,\u201d calling her \u201ca visionary figure in the Italian and international fashion world.\u201d",
      "She had launched the business in 1953 with her husband\u00a0Ottavio Missoni, developing a brand which became popular for its colorful knitwear featuring geometric patterns and stripes, including the signature zigzag motif known as fiammato.",
      "Born into a family of textile artisans close to the northern Italian town of Varese, Rosita studied modern languages.",

      "The Missoni brand gained international recognition and awards for its distinctive patterns and avant-garde use of textiles and an approach to fashion often compared to modern art.",
      "It was also helped by what was dubbed the \u201cbattle of the bras\u201d in 1967.",
      "Missoni had been invited to show at the Pitti Palace in Florence but before the models went out on the runways Rosita noticed that their bras were visible through their tops, ruining the intended color and pattern effect.",

      "Ottavio died in May 2013 at the age of 92, four months after their son\u2019s plane had gone missing but before the wreckage had been found.",
      "The brand expanded into home collections and hotels. In 2018 Italian investment fund FSI invested 70 million euros in the company in exchange for a 41% stake.",

    "summary": "A Ukrainian pipeline supplying Russian natural gas to Europe was closed Wednesday after Ukraine declined to renew the deal keeping it open.",
    "story": [
      "A major natural gas pipeline supplying Russian energy to Europe ran dry Wednesday after Ukraine stopped Moscow\u2019s six-decade supply in hope of hurting its invader financially.",
      "The planned move ends an era when many European countries kept warm using gas pumped by Russia \u2014 which was in turn accused of using that dependency to blackmail its Western neighbors after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which it denies.",
      "Gazprom confirmed in a statement that the pipeline agreement had lapsed following Ukraine\u2019s \u201crepeated and explicit refusal to extend these agreements.\u201d",
      "Just as the pipeline agreement expired, Russia launched its latest salvo of drone attacks on Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to build on his battlefield momentum by targeting Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure during its bitter winter.",
      "Most of Russia\u2019s 111 drones were repelled by Ukraine\u2019s Western-backed missile defense systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technology, officials said, although at least six people were injured and two were killed in the capital, Kyiv.",
      "\u201cEven on New Year\u2019s Eve, Russia was only worried about how to hurt Ukraine,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said early Wednesday.",
      "Ukraine is embattled militarily, with Russian forces making front-line gains in recent months, as well as shrouded by geopolitical uncertainty. President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to enter office this month, has unnerved many in Europe by refusing to commit to the same multibillion-dollar support for Ukraine provided by the Biden administration.",
      "As well as launching attacks into Russian territory, Ukraine is trying to hurt Moscow in other ways. Part of that is not renewing the pipeline agreement, which expired after having supplied Europe with Russian gas via Ukraine for six decades.",
      "\u201cWe stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event,\u201d Ukraine Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko said in a statement. \u201cRussia is losing markets, it will suffer financial losses.\u201d",
      "Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said on X that the development was apt comeuppance for Putin, whom he accused of trying to \"blackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies.\"",
      "The move was no surprise; Ukraine repeatedly said it would not renew the deal, which Zelenskyy said last month gave Russia \u201cthe opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.\u201d",
      "But it will not be painless, with Ukraine losing up to $1 billion a year in transit fees it charged Russia to use its pipeline, Reuters reported. That\u2019s less than the $5 billion Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant, is set to lose annually, according to the news agency.",
      "Gazprom confirmed in a statement Wednesday that the pipeline agreement had lapsed following \"repeated and explicit refusal to extend these agreements\" by Ukraine.",
      "Most European countries no longer depend on Russian gas, having diversified their supplies \u2014 to the United States, Qatar and others \u2014 after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Nevertheless, halting the pipeline sent European Union natural gas prices rising to 50 euros ($52), their highest since the 330-euro spike in 2022 after the invasion.",
      "Turning off the taps may also affect Austria, Slovakia and particularly Moldova \u2014 which is not part of the E.U. \u2014\u00a0all of whom rely on Russian gas more than most in Europe. Already in the Moldovan breakaway region of Transdniestria, home to 450,00 people and 1,500 Russian troops, the local energy company cut off domestic hot water and heating supplies Wednesday, Reuters said.",
      "Not only is Russia's Ukrainian natural gas artery down, but the Nord Stream gas pipelines also remain damaged by as-yet unexplained explosions in September 2022. That leaves only the TurkStream pipeline linking Russia with Turkey, Hungary and Serbia.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 2, 2025, 7 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the pipeline deal gave Russia \u201cthe opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.\u201d It was last month, not earlier this month."
