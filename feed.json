      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s royal family is always in the public eye, their every move documented by reporters and captured for posterity by photographers. But even for a group of people who live their lives under a microscope, 2024 was something unique.",
      "In a year marked by illness and recovery that sidelined both King Charles III and the Princess of Wales for extended periods, the eyes of the public and the telephoto lenses of the press corps probed every appearance for clues about what was to come.",
      "The year began peacefully enough as Charles seemingly got on with the business of being king after celebrating his coronation in 2023 and mourning the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, the previous year.",
      "But things became complicated very quickly. In early January, Kensington Palace revealed that the Princess of Wales, usually known as Kate, had undergone planned abdominal surgery, without specifying why the operation was needed. Just 10 days later, Charles was admitted to the same London hospital for treatment of an enlarged prostate.",
      "Social media went crazy over Kate\u2019s condition, filling a vacuum of information on specifics with a tsunami of uninformed speculation.",
      "Soon both revealed they were suffering from cancer, putting enormous strain on the royal family.",
      "With two of the most visible royals out sick \u2014 and Prince William taking time off to support his wife \u2014 it was challenging for the rest of the family to keep up with the never-ending whirl of public appearances that the British public demands.",
      "But both slowly returned to duty after receiving treatment. The public studied the pictures to judge for themselves how the royals were responding.",
      "Charles, 76, came back first, marking his return with a visit to a cancer center, where he shared his experiences with patients undergoing chemotherapy. Sometimes seen as stuffy and out of touch, Charles left the clinic as a king who could understand and empathize with those facing illness and the uncertain path to recovery.",
      "As the monarch walked out the doors, his face broke into a broad grin and he held a bouquet of pink spring flowers aloft in triumph, celebrating with the crowd that had turned out to wish him well.",
      "Underscoring his improvement, Charles took a stamina-sapping trip in October, traveling across 12 time zones to visit Australia and Samoa.",
      "Kate\u2019s return took longer.",
      "The public got their first post-diagnosis glimpse of the 42-year-old princess through a carriage window as she attended the king\u2019s birthday parade, known as Trooping the Color, in June. Kate also appeared at the national Remembrance Day ceremony honoring fallen servicemen and women in November as well as her annual Christmas carol service in December as she slowly took on more duties.",
      "But there\u2019s one picture that captures the princess\u2019 year.",
      "It\u2019s from the day in July when Kate attended the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final, stepping in front of the public for the first time without a hat brim or a window between her and the cameras.",
      "The crowd is blurred, and she\u2019s looking over her shoulder. Her smile is huge."

    "title": "\u2018The Bibi Files,\u2019 with leaked Netanyahu footage, can't be seen in Israel. Israelis are finding ways",
    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:42:16 -0500",
    "summary": "&ldquo;The Bibi Files&rdquo; started with a sudden leak that turned into a deluge",
    "story": [
      "\u201cThe Bibi Files\u201d started with a sudden leak that turned into a deluge",
      "NEW YORK -- Veteran documentarian Alex Gibney, who in a decades-long career has tackled many a thorny issue, wasn't planning a film about Israel \u2014 until one day last year, when a stunning leak fell into his hands.",
      "The leak turned out to be more like a deluge.",
      "Suddenly, Gibney, through a source who contacted him on the Signal messaging app, was being offered access to copious video recordings of police interviews with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his wife Sara, his son Yair, and a host of associates and benefactors, all conducted as part of the sprawling corruption case against Netanyahu. It amounted to an astonishing 1,000-plus hours of tapes.",
      "The Oscar-winning filmmaker didn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but sensed this was something big. He turned to longtime Israeli investigative reporter Raviv Drucker, who did a deep dive into the material, Gibney says, and showed him that \u201cwe had something that was very explosive.\u201d Then Gibney enlisted colleague Alexis Bloom, who had worked in Israel, to direct.",
      "The result: \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d a hard-hitting documentary that certainly has timing on its side \u2014 this week, as it was released on streaming, Netanyahu took the stand in the long-running case.",
      "If the timing is fortuitous, the film faced other obstacles. For one thing, Gibney and Bloom had to raise funds without disclosing to potential backers what they had, given the secrecy involved. Many potential backers and distributors were also nervous about getting involved, especially once war broke out after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Then there was the biggest obstacle of all: The film cannot legally be shown in Israel, due to privacy laws regulating such proceedings.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Israelis aren\u2019t seeing it, though. Many have managed to watch the film either by using a VPN to bypass streaming restrictions, or by watching leaked versions that made their way to social media. \u201cThe film is being pirated like wildfire in Israel,\u201d says Bloom.",
      "And it has made a predictable splash, just as Netanyahu becomes the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. On Tuesday, he promised defiantly to knock down the \u201cabsurd\u201d corruption allegations against him.",
      "The longest-serving prime minister in Israel\u2019s history is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests, and of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage.",
      "In the leaked police videos, the 75-year-old leader sits at his desk in a surprisingly cramped office, a map of the region behind him. He expresses outrage at the proceedings, calls witnesses liars, and notes he has much weightier matters to attend to. At one point, asked about numbers of champagne bottles, he says he spends his time counting missiles threatening Israel, not bottles. Frequently, his answer is he doesn't remember.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of people on the record telling us what a great memory he has,\u201d says Gibney. \u201cAnd almost every question that could be possibly incriminating, he says \u2018I can\u2019t recall.\u2019\"",
      "Reviews in Israeli media for \u201cThe Bibi Files\u201d have mostly been positive, while noting that Netanyahu is portrayed in a harsh light. Not surprisingly, public reaction reflects longstanding divisions over the polarizing leader. He and his supporters say he\u2019s the subject of a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and biased justice system out to topple his rule.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s opponents will swear by the film and will only become more convinced that he is corrupt, dizzy with power and leading us to destruction,\u201d Nir Wolf, TV critic for the Netanyahu-friendly Israel Hayom paper, wrote. \u201cHis supporters will want to embrace him more.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has also noticed the film. In September, his lawyer asked the country\u2019s attorney general to investigate Drucker, who is a co-producer with Gibney, accusing him of trying to influence the legal proceedings. No investigation has been launched. (In the film, Drucker notes that Netanyahu has previously sued him three times.)",
      "The film, which intersperses police footage with commentary from former officials, Netanyahu associates, journalists and other analysts \u2014 including, frequently, Drucker \u2014 begins with the prime minister sitting for his first interview.",
      "\u201cWith Netanyahu, nothing concentrates his mind more than the sound of the prison gate slammed behind his back,\u201d comments Nimrod Novik, a former adviser to late Prime Minister Shimon Peres. One of Gibney and Bloom's key arguments will be that Netanyahu\u2019s fear of potential prison time has influenced his policy decisions \u2014 from judicial reform to war.",
      "Netanyahu appears indignant throughout. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me delusional questions,\u201d he tells his questioners. \u201cThis is preposterous and insane.\u201d",
      "In other footage, Arnon Milchan, the billionaire Hollywood mogul, Netanyahu friend and, more recently, prosecution witness, describes delivering fancy pink champagne on demand for Sara Netanyahu, sometimes toting a cooler himself, as part of an alleged gifts-for-favors scheme. Elsewhere, Sara Netanyahu sits for questioning herself. \u201cHow are you not ashamed of yourselves?\u201d she sharply admonishes the interviewers. She tells them that outside Israel, her husband is justly received as a king.",
      "Footage also includes interviews with Israeli-American billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. Sheldon Adelson expresses discomfort with the friendship \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll continue the relationship with them\" \u2014 and dismay over the cost of Netanyahu's preferred Cuban cigars: $1,100 for a box of 10.",
      "And a combative Yair Netanyahu, the couple\u2019s 33-year old son, tells his questioners: \u201cYou\u2019re investigating me because the Israeli police has become the Stasi secret police, wanting to overthrow the government.\u201d",
      "Director Bloom insists the film is not intended to preach to the choir \u2014 that it is made not for leftist opponents of Netanyahu, but for centrists.",
      "\u201cYou know, a hardcore Bibi-ist is probably going to remain a hardcore Bibi-est,\u201d the director says. \u201cBut there are a lot of centrists. \u2026 And it\u2019s very much a portrait of one family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anti-Israel, in the slightest.\u201d",
      "The filmmakers say they paused after the Oct. 7 attack, trying to figure out how to approach it. As part of the historical context in the film, they include chilling scenes of the raid on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhat was this going to mean?\u201d Gibney says they wondered. \u201cWith a bit of time, it became clear that this tale that we started before Oct. 7 remained a story of corruption \u2014 the size of the corruption kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\u201d",
      "The film, which began streaming Wednesday on the new service Jolt.film, draws a direct connection between Netanyahu's legal problems and the war. Through various commentators, it argues that the criminal cases led the prime minister to launch a campaign to weaken the country\u2019s judiciary, which in turn sparked mass protests and divisions that created an image of national weakness and led Hamas to attack. (Netanyahu rejects all such accusations).",
      "Bloom says she hopes people will, having watched \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d consider the idea that \u201cterm limits are a good idea.\" (Netanyahu has served a total of 17 years as prime minister.)",
      "And she also hopes they will take away a simple concept. \u201cIt's OK to criticize the prime minister of Israel, and it\u2019s not antisemitic and it\u2019s not anti-Israel,\u201d the director says. \"He\u2019s a political leader, like any other. \u201c",

      "Wallen, who appeared in court alongside his attorney, was sentenced to spend seven days in a DUI education center and be under supervised probation for two years.",
      "\u201cConditionally guilty,\u201d Wallen said when Judge Cynthia Chappell asked how he would plead.",
      "According to the arrest affidavit, Wallen was accused of throwing a chair off the roof of Chief\u2019s bar on April 7. The chair landed about a yard (meter) from the officers, who spoke to witnesses and reviewed security footage. Witnesses told officers that they saw Wallen pick up a chair, throw it off the roof and laugh about it.",
      "Shortly after the incident, Wallen issued a statement in which he said he accepted \u201cresponsibility\u201d and was \u201cnot proud\u201d of his behavior. The statement did not include an apology but did mention making \u201camends\u201d and touching base with law enforcement.",

      "Their bond, built over 30 years of brotherhood, began when Dr. Dre shaped Snoop's game-changing debut, \u201cDoggystyle,\u201d a cornerstone of hip-hop history. From young dreamers chasing stardom to legends cementing their legacies, the duo has always moved in sync.",
      "Now, the dynamic pair reunites for Snoop's \u201cMissionary,\u201d his milestone 20th studio album, which releases Friday. In a music industry where lasting relationships are rare, their bond remains solid.",
      "\u201cWe were just playing on our raw ability, and it worked ... But now you're dealing with professionals who are like perfectionists and skilled at what they do,\u201d Snoop said while smoking a blunt inside his dressing room trailer. The 15-track project features several big-name guest appearances, including Eminem, 50 Cent, Sting, Method Man, Jelly Roll, Tom Petty and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko.",
      "Before the interview, the ultra-smooth entertainer had just wrapped up rehearsals for \u201cThe Voice\u201d with British musician Sting, delivering a performance that aired this week on NBC. Both hit the stage on the competition series to perform Snoop's album single \u201cAnother Part of Me,\u201d which was sampled from The Police's \u201cMessage in a Bottle,\u201d a 1979 song that Sting wrote and sang as lead singer.",
      "Sting quickly approved the sample for \u201cAnother Part of Me,\u201d getting to know Snoop's personality during the superstar rapper's meteoric rise at the Paris Olympics this summer, despite never meeting him in person. Snoop carried the Olympic torch, captivated audiences as NBC\u2019s prime-time correspondent, swam with Michael Phelps, attended a U.S. women\u2019s soccer game with Megan Rapinoe, danced with Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles and cheered on Caeleb Dressel alongside the swimmer\u2019s wife and son.",
      "When Sting first heard the track, he was impressed by Snoop's vocal ability but found himself contemplating how he could contribute to the song.",
      "\u201cHe asked me to sing a verse, which is difficult,\" said Sting, who met Snoop for the first time on \u201cThe Voice\u201d set. \"It's a different style from the one I normally sing. It's a very, very rapid rap style, which is kind of challenging for me. But I love a challenge. I played the guitar on the track, so I feel very much a part of it. I think it's going to be a hit.\u201d",
      "Like Sting, many others across the globe have witnessed Snoop ascend to new heights. Along with being a breakout star at the Paris Games, he's been seen in TV commercials and co-hosting a cooking show with Martha Stewart. He stepped in during a Wrestlemania match and even threw out the first pitch at the Reds-Brewers MLB game before giving his unique play-by-play commentary.",

      "This year, Dr. Dre and Snoop launched two alcohol brands: A canned cocktail, Gin & Juice, and the premium gin, Still G.I.N., which is a play on \u201cStill D.R.E.,\u201d the hit single from Dr. Dre\u2019s multiplatinum \u201c2001\u201d album released in 1999.",
      "\u201cIt's like you don't have to speak. Your work speaks for you now as opposed to you knocking on doors. Now, people are opening doors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand who I am as a person and what my love vessel is and that makes them want to get next to me.\u201d",
      "Amid Snoop's hustle and bustle, he said Dr. Dre felt it was time to head back into the studio to start recording a new album \u2014 a process that began nearly two years ago. They recorded in spurts.",
      "\u201c(Dr. Dre) was watching me in the entertainment world and figuring that my music hand ain't matching my entertainment hand,\u201d Snoop said. \u201cHe wanted to put music back in the foreground with his production. leadership and guidance on the project.\"",
      "While recording, Snoop said Dr. Dre musically knew him better than himself at times. He said no other producers \u2014 except for Pharrell and Battlecat \u2014 have the cachet to critique him like Dr. Dre.",
      "\u201cHe would basically write it for me, tell me how to say it, give me the enunciation and the way I\u2019m supposed to punctuate it,\u201d Snoop said of Dr. Dre. \u201cHe\u2019s like a real (expletive) producer, director. He acts for me and knows what I\u2019m supposed to do in his body and then he makes me do it in my body. And if it\u2019s not right, it ain\u2019t right.\u201d",
      "Snoop credited Dr. Dre's influence for enhancing the track \u201cNow or Never,\u201d a deeply sentimental song that left him feeling emotional at times. He described it as a \u201ctears of joy\u201d record, dedicated to the memory of recently deceased loved ones, including his younger brother, who died earlier this year.",

So, to have a moment of reflection sometimes makes the mood damp or a little bit light. But it\u2019s needed. It\u2019s necessary because it happens in life. It\u2019s good to speak on it. ... My pen is my mightiest sword. I always write where I live.",
      "Snoop is determined to restore Death Row Records to its former glory. After acquiring the brand in 2022, he faced some skepticism \u2014 even from Dr. Dre and Interscope Records at first before eventually winning them over \u2014 due to the label's troubled reputation. He's on a mission to rewrite its story and steer it toward a brighter legacy \u2014 just like he's done for his career.",
      "Snoop's new album was released in conjunction with his label, Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records and Interscope, which was co-founded by music industry entrepreneur Jimmy Iovine.

He credits his turning point to his acquittal on murder charges in 1996, a moment that marked a significant shift in his life and career.",
      "\u201cMy mother raised me the right way, but I chose the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to separate from certain people on Death Row (at the time). ... I could say that those were decisions that I\u2019m happy I made, even though I may have ruffled feathers and made people look at me like I\u2019m soft or weak.\u201d",
      "Snoop added: \u201cNah, I\u2019m smart. I\u2019m thinking. When you grow old, that\u2019s called wisdom. And when you get old, that\u2019s because you have wisdom.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker RaMell Ross adapts Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer-winning \u201cNickel Boys\u201d in a new film out Friday",
      "A movie shot in first person sounds like a gimmick. Part of the magic of filmed storytelling is accepting that something can be from someone\u2019s point of view and yet also from a distance. Using the camera as a character\u2019s actual eyes is the domain of university students and niche experimental filmmakers. In a commercial film, it\u2019s to be deployed only in very limited doses.",
      "And yet, with \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d filmmaker RaMell Ross not only commits to the idea but delivers one of the most powerful films of the year in the process \u2014 a lyrical, heartbreaking and haunting journey into the darkness of a brutal reform school in the Jim Crow South.",
      "Ross and co-writer Joslyn Barnes weren\u2019t working from scratch, but Colson Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer-winning novel about two teenage boys, Elwood and Turner, who become friends while wards of a juvenile reform school in Florida. It\u2019s called the Nickel Academy in the novel and the film, which is fiction, but based on the horrific abuses at the very real Dozier School for Boys, in the Florida panhandle, where boys were beaten, raped and killed. Some of the bodies were shipped back to their homes. Others were buried in unmarked graves that only have recently come to light.",
      "The haunting truth of the broader picture, the all-too-recent displays of inhumanity and racism, looms over every frame. \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is not exploitation porn, however. In fact, when one brutal beating does happen, Ross directs his gaze elsewhere: A wall, a shoe, a nervous hand, the corner of a bible. The sounds from the other room, the cracking of the whip and the grunts are undeniable. As in \u201cThe Zone of Interest,\u201d we don\u2019t need to see it to feel its impact.",
      "This is more of a memory piece than anything else, a reconciling of unspeakable traumas and human resilience through the eyes of two boys. Elwood (Ethan Herisse) is our way in. We see his youth in Tallahassee, growing up with his grandmother Hattie (an especially impactful Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor ) who is as playful as she is protective of this young boy who has only her. He\u2019s smart and attuned to the civil rights movement at large, listening in on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s speeches and impressing his teachers, one of whom recommends him for classes at a technical college. He hitches a ride on his way with a man in a slick suit and car, not knowing that it was stolen. When the man is caught Elwood, the innocent, gets sent to Nickel.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be in Nickel,\u201d a younger white employee ( Fred Hechinger ) says to Elwood early on. He\u2019s just received his draft notice and might even really believe it. While he seems like perhaps he\u2019s more friend than jailor, his truest nature will be revealed down the line. Others are more sniveling and obvious, like Hamish Linklater as the school\u2019s administrator who is more than ready to dole out violent punishments with his own hands.",
      "It\u2019s not all Black kids in Nickel, but there\u2019s a segregated hierarchy with the students, one that\u2019s neatly tucked away when inspectors come to the grounds as the employees and administrators scurry to present a good face. Even they knew that their practices are something to be ashamed of.",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of the first-person camera is its attention to details. It\u2019s not acting like a camera, but a person who doesn\u2019t always see everything \u201cimportant.\u201d Sometimes it's one\u2019s own hand, sometimes shoes, tattered shirts, darkness, or a puff of smoke.",
      "And while we\u2019d gotten glimpses of Elwood before, in a camera booth with a girlfriend, the first time we really see him is through Turner (Brandon Wilson) one fateful day in the cafeteria. Turner is laid back and a little world weary, an orphan and a realist counterpart to Elwood\u2019s hopeful idealism. Though opposite in sensibility, these two stick together, finding light and joy even in their hellish surroundings. The camera even starts to shift between them \u2014 when they\u2019re looking at one another, they\u2019re also looking through the lens, at us. There are also flashes forward to a man at a computer ( Daveed Diggs ), seen mostly from behind, reading about the discoveries of unmarked graves on the grounds.",
      "The threads do come together, but it requires a bit of patience and giving yourself over to the film, which is both formally and emotionally eye-opening. Adapting great literature can sometimes send filmmakers running towards the conventional; Thank goodness Ross charted his own path instead.",
      "\u201cNickel Boys,\u201d an Amazon MGM and Orion release in limited theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201cviolent content, some strong language, racial slurs, smoking, racism and thematic material.\u201d Running time: 140 minutes. Four stars out of four."

      "\u201cThis is a long overdue opportunity for the victims to take the power back after carrying the burden of the assaults in silence for several years,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile a lawsuit will not undo the wrongs done to them, it enables the survivors to regain the power and dignity that was stripped from them by Sean Combs.\u201d",

      "The lawsuits involve incidents taking place from 2019 to 2022. The men, all identified as John Doe, say they were unwittingly served drugged drinks and then sexually assaulted by Combs and others.",
      "They each seek a jury trial and to be awarded unspecified damages from Combs.",
      "One of the men claims Combs drugged and raped him in 2020 when the two met at Combs' suite at the InterContinental hotel in Times Square to discuss payments the man was owed as a longtime employee of the entrepreneur.",

      "A block in downtown San Francisco has been renamed for acclaimed photojournalist Joe Rosenthal, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his iconic photo of U.S. Marines raising the flag on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima during WWII",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A photojournalist who captured one of the most enduring images of World War II \u2014 the U.S. Marines raising the flag on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima \u2014 had a block in downtown San Francisco named for him Thursday.",
      "Joe Rosenthal, who died in 2006 at age 94, was working for The Associated Press in 1945 when he took the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo.",
      "After the war, he went to work as a staff photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle, and for 35 years until his retirement in 1981, he captured moments of city life both extraordinary and routine.",
      "Rosenthal photographed famous people for the paper, including a young Willie Mays getting his hat fitted as a San Francisco Giant in 1957, and regular people, including children making a joyous dash for freedom on the last day of school in 1965.",
      "The 600 block of Sutter Street, near downtown\u2019s Union Square, became Joe Rosenthal Way after a short ceremony Thursday morning. The Marines Memorial Club, which sits on the block, welcomed the street\u2019s new name.",
      "Aaron Peskin, who heads the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, welcomed the city's political elite, military officials and members of Rosenthal's family to toast the late photographer, who was born in Washington, D.C., to Russian Jewish immigrant parents.",
      "The famous photo became the centerpiece of a war bonds poster that helped raise $26 billion in 1945. Tom Graves, chapter historian for the USMC Combat Correspondents Association, which pushed for the street naming, said the image helped win the war.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve grown over the years to appreciate also his role as a San Francisco newspaper photographer who, as Supervisor Peskin says, went to work every day photographing the city where we all live, we all love,\u201d he said.",
      "Graves and others said they look forward to tourists and locals happening upon the street sign, seeing Rosenthal's name for perhaps the first time, and then going online to learn about the photographer with the terrible eyesight but an eye for composition.",
      "Rosenthal never considered himself a wartime hero, just a working photographer lucky enough to document the courage of soldiers.",
      "When complimented on his Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, Rosenthal said: \u201cSure, I took the photo. But the Marines took Iwo Jima.\u201d"

      "Pro Shop raised nearly $20 million this summer from Powerhouse Capital, the PGA Tour and EP Golf Ventures, among others. It also acquired Skratch, a digital and social media network the PGA Tour created about a decade ago to appeal to a younger audience.",
      "The Skins Game was the cornerstone of what once was known as the \u201csilly season\u201d in golf. It began in 1983 with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson and Gary Player (Vin Scully was the announcer) and held over Thanksgiving weekend in the California desert.",

      "NEW YORK -- RaMell Ross sometimes sends his photography students out on a unique assignment. He tells them to photograph a white person, a Black person, an Asian person and an Indian person. \u201cAnd,\u201d he adds, \u201cI want you to ask them how they want to be represented.\u201d",
      "Before Ross was a photographer, a professor, a documentarian and, most recently, a feature filmmaker, he was a point guard whose 6-foot-6-inches height allowed him to peer over defenders to see the entire court. Ross\u2019 basketball career was derailed by injuries while at Georgetown University. But he has, ever since been fascinated with the ways we see.",
      "In \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d one of the most thrillingly innovative American films of the decade, Ross adapts Colson Whitehead\u2019s 2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. It\u2019s about two young men \u2014 Elwood (Ethan Herisse) and Turner (Brandon Wilson) \u2014 who\u2019ve been sent to an abusive, mid-century Florida reform school called Nickel Academy.",
      "The story, laced with the cruelties of the Jim Crow-era South, has commonalities with films made before. But the grammar of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is entirely its own. Ross shot the film, which opens Friday in New York and expands in coming weeks, almost entirely from the point of view of Elwood and Turner. As we watch, we\u2019re looking through their eyes. We gaze up at the sky or feel a blow to the head or feel the warmth of someone affectionately looking back at us.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ode to looking out of the eyes of those whose eyes have been owned by others, and whose perception has been managed by others,\u201d Ross says. \u201cFilms that take place in the past reproduce the aesthetics of the past. I question the aesthetics of the past.\"",
      "In a medium that has been called \u201can empathy machine,\u201d \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is a striking leap forward. In situating the viewer within the inner world of Elwood and Turner, it brings us closer to their experience, while shedding many of the conventions of both modern moviemaking and historical depictions from the time period of \u201cNickel Boys.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know if any person in here that has wild stereotypes about the world that they acknowledge or don\u2019t if they saw through my eyes, they would be other gone, challenged or would collapse,\u201d said Ross in a recent interview over coffee in midtown Manhattan. \u201cThe power is in the self and the eyes.\u201d",
      "For Ross, who teaches visual art at Brown University, \u201cNickel Boys\u201d isn\u2019t just about finding a new way to photograph. It\u2019s an attempt to uncover a visual language of consciousness, and specifically Black consciousness. In the time of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d the dominant imagery was created overwhelmingly through a perspective that wasn\u2019t Elwood\u2019s, that wasn\u2019t Turner\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThe question is,\u201d says Ross, \u201ccan you repopulate the missing archive?\u201d",
      "POV camerawork has been tried occasionally through movie history. Robert Montgomery\u2019s 1947 Raymond Chandler adaptation \u201cThe Lady in the Lake\u201d is generally credited as the first mainstream film shot in first person. That same year, \u201cDark Passage\u201d began with a first-person prison escape, and doesn\u2019t change perspective until the escapee (Humphry Bogart) undergoes plastic surgery.",
      "But Ross wasn\u2019t thinking about any precedents. Ross, who wrote the script with Joslyn Barnes complete with head turns and camera moves, wanted something much deeper than a gimmick.",
      "In his most celebrated photography series, \u201cSouth County, AL (a Hale County),\u201d Ross examined Blackness across a Southern terrain indelibly traversed by photographers like Walker Evans. (Ross had moved to Greensboro, Alabama, to do social work and teach a college readiness program.) His images tend to be in dialogue with the photography of the past. Time, Ross says, became his medium.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely interested in thickening the present,\u201d he says.",
      "For a month before shooting, Ross and cinematographer Jomo Fray rehearsed with a small digital camera. Fray, who shot Raven Jackson\u2019s lyrical 2023 mosaic drama \u201cAll Dirt Roads Taste of Salt,\u201d found the process of finding new filmic vernacular enthralling.",
      "\u201cWe have only begun to scratch the very surface of what cinema is capable of. Cinema is a medium that shares a language with our dreams,\u201d says Fray. \u201cWe\u2019re still at the infancy of this as an artistic form.\u201d",
      "Ross and Fray, each of whom can be dazzlingly analytical about filmmaking and photography, found they weren\u2019t exactly seeking POV. In reality, that would be too shaky and uncentered. Instead, they honed what they call \u201csentient perspective\u201d \u2014 a POV that didn't mimic eyes but came closer to the feeling of being within a body.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an invitation,\u201d says Fray. \u201cThe image is an invitation for the viewer to really place themselves in a body that they may or may not recognize. For two hours, you truly are walking in the shoes of another person. And that\u2019s at the heart of the promise of cinema.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. Countless basic actions would need to be rethought. What would a hug look like? Production design, by Norah Mendis, essentially needed to be in all directions, 360 degrees. Operating the camera, Fray almost had to be an actor in the film, himself.",
      "\u201cThe second that we started getting into how to make the film, I understood immediately why films like this aren\u2019t made,\u201d says Ross.",
      "Yet, part of the beauty of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is how impressionistic the imagery still is. We get to know Elwood and Turner not just by what they do or what they say, but how they look upon the world, what they notice. Herisse and Wilson had the unique experience of always acting either alongside the camera rig or staring back into a lens.",
      "\u201cA lot of time we\u2019d be trading places with Jomo or RaMell, but we\u2019d stay really close and try to stay as present as possible,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cOn the other side, when you have to look down a lens, that\u2019s a different thing. You\u2019re trying to not look like you\u2019re looking at a camera, but seeing the other person on the other side of the camera.\"",
      "\u201cThe first time I watched it, there was a complete detachment,\u201d says Herisse. \u201cI didn\u2019t make the connection that that was me.\u201d",
      "The experience of watching \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has been transcendent for many, though some critics have been more tepid about how the subjective POV alters your relationship to the characters. Some have said that connection is harder without the benefit of regular close-ups.",
      "While Ross grants that \u201cNickel Boys\u201d \u2014 a Golden Globe nominee for best feature film, drama, and a winner with several major awards groups \u2014 might be challenging for those who don\u2019t regularly engage with art or go to the theater, it\u2019s not a criticism he has much patience for.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive) that you want these Black boys\u2019 narratives to be told in a way you think makes you feel good, or make you feel connected emotionally. Can you hear yourself? Do you know how self-centered you sound?\u201d says Ross, addressing those critics. \u201cDo you know a way to treat the viewer not as a voyeur in the death of Black folks? I don\u2019t know, but I think there\u2019s an interesting way to try that doesn\u2019t repeat the brutality in the minds of others. It gives them life. It restores something. It\u2019s not about their death.\u201d",
      "Ross imagines he\u2019ll be making more movies, but, he says, he\u2019s in no rush. As a professor he gets to watch movies, look at photography, and talk to smart young people who have been trained in words but not in images.",
      "And Ross is still working out his own vernacular. \u201cShooting\u201d film, for example, doesn\u2019t sound right to him. What\u2019s better?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Ross says. \u201cEngage the world. Go participate. Go make images.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange after being recognized for the second time by Time magazine as its person of the year.",
      "The honors for the businessman-turned-politician are a measure of Trump's remarkable comeback from an ostracized former president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a president-elect who won the White House decisively in November.",
      "Before Trump rang the opening bell at 9:30 a.m., a first for the native New Yorker, he spoke at the exchange and called it \u201ca tremendous honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cTime magazine, getting this honor for the second time, I think I like it better this time actually,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump, daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and Vice President-elect JD Vance, grinned as people chanted \u201cUSA\u201d before he opened the trading day. He then raised his fist.",

      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a tremendous run. We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Sam Jacobs, the magazine's editor in chief, made the announcement on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d show, saying Trump was someone who \u201cfor better or for worse, had the most influence on the news in 2024.\u201d Trump was Time\u2019s Person of the Year in 2016, when he was first elected to the White House.",
      "\u201cThis is someone who made an historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who\u2019s reordering American politics,\" Jacobs said.",
      "In an interview with the magazine that was published Thursday, Trump spoke about his final campaign blitz and election win.",
      "\u201cI called it \u201872 Days of Fury,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe hit the nerve of the country. The country was angry.\u201d",

      "The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the bell-ringing, which has become a marker of culture and politics.",
      "Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time, where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs.",

      "In his latest interview, Trump reaffirmed plans to pardon most of those convicted in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons.",
      "He said he would not ask members of his administration to sign a loyalty pledge. \u201cI think I will be able to, for the most part, determine who\u2019s loyal,\u201d he said. But he said he will fire anyone who doesn\u2019t follow his policies.",

He suggested that daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who recently announced she is stepping down from her role as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, could be a part of his political dynasty.",
      "\u201cI think there could be, yeah. I see the people we\u2019re talking about. Lara has been amazing. Look, she was the head of the Republican Party,\u201d he said.",
      "With Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., awaiting confirmation to be secretary of state, Lara Trump has said serving in the Senate is \u201csomething I would seriously consider.\u201d",

      "Owens is scheduled to speak at events in several Australian cities and in Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March.

      "More than 3,700 residents have returned to their Malibu homes as weather conditions improved enough to help firefighters battling a Southern California blaze",
      "MALIBU, Calif. -- More than 3,700 residents were allowed to return to their Malibu homes on Thursday after calmer winds and rising humidity in Southern California helped firefighters battle a blaze that had forced thousands, including college students and celebrities, to evacuate earlier this week.",
      "But another 1,600 people with homes in Malibu \u2014 a city typically known for its rugged canyons, stunning bluffs and celebrities' seaside mansions \u2014 remained under evacuation orders. All told, some 20,000 residents in the city and neighboring areas had been affected by mandatory evacuation orders and warnings since the fire broke out late Monday.",
      "Firefighters continued to battle the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, which was only 20% contained over about 6.3 square miles (16.3 square kilometers) Thursday. The flames were fed by powerful winds that swept through the region in the beginning of the week. But the weather improved so much Wednesday that meteorologists discontinued all red flag warnings, which indicate high fire danger, and fire crews were able to successfully push back against the flames.",
      "Winds would continue to ease, said meteorologist Mike Wofford with the National Weather Service's office for Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll even get a little sea breeze there that will increase humidity in the fire zone,\u201d Wofford said Thursday. \u201cGenerally everything\u2019s getting better.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the fire started. Officials said four homes have been destroyed and at least six others have been damaged, though crews had only surveyed about 25% of the affected area, said Deputy Chief Eleni Pappas of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.",
      "\u201cThis is a tragedy that goes beyond our personal residences,\u201d Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart said, adding that restaurants have lost food in their freezers from power outages and people who travel to Malibu for employment are out of work.",
      "The 3,700 residents were allowed to return Thursday after the county sheriff's department lifted mandatory evacuation orders.",
      "Flames also reached just short of Pepperdine University, where students were forced to shelter in place on campus on Monday and again Tuesday.",
      "An early analysis showed little to no damage to structures on campus, the university said. Final exams were postponed or canceled and faculty members were determining how best to complete the semester, which ends at Pepperdine this week.",
      "Lonnie Vidaurri\u2019s four-bedroom home in the Malibu Knolls neighborhood was one of those impacted. He evacuated to a hotel in Santa Monica with his wife and two young daughters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty torched all around,\u201d Vidaurri said of his house. He expects that the family\u2019s pet bunnies did not survive the fire, and that they lost most of their things. \u201cMy girls cried, obviously, but it could have been worse.\u201d",
      "Mimi Teller, a Red Cross spokesperson who works at a shelter in nearby Pacific Palisades, said many evacuees arrived in pajamas and were \u201cdefinitely in shock.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody even had a backpack, it was, \u2018Get out now,\u2019\u201d Teller said.",
      "Cher, one of many celebrities with homes in Malibu, evacuated from her home when ordered and was staying at a hotel, her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said Tuesday. Jane Seymour also fled the seaside city. \u201cThe fires in our community are a stark reminder of how quickly life can change,\u201d the actress wrote on Instagram Tuesday.",
      "And Dick Van Dyke said in a Facebook post that he and his wife, Arlene Silver, evacuated as the fire swept in. The actor later told NBC's \u201cToday\u201d that neighbors helped them get out.",
      "\u201cI was trying to crawl to the car. I had exhausted myself. I couldn\u2019t get up,\u201d said Van Dyke, who turns 99 on Friday. \u201cAnd three neighbors came and carried me out, and came back and put out a little fire in the guesthouse and saved me.\u201d",
      "The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Monday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean. It was propelled by Santa Ana winds, with erratic gusts that topped 40 mph (64 kph). Santa Anas are notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Utilities preemptively shut off power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses, starting Monday night, to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Anas, which can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. As of Thursday morning, electricity had been restored for all Southern California Edison customers, said utility spokesperson Gabriela Ornelas.",
      "The Woolsey Fire that roared through the area in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. Asked Thursday if Edison equipment was involved in the Franklin Fire, Ornelas referred all questions regarding the cause to fire officials."

      "Allen and Soon-Yi Previn \u201csimply decided that a military professional who wanted to be paid fairly was not a good fit to work in the Allen home,\u201d private chef Hermie Fajardo said in a civil complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Allen and Previn knew Fajardo would need time off for military training exercises when they and their home manager hired him as their full-time chef in June 2024 at an annual salary of $85,000, the complaint said.

      "When Fajardo returned to work, \u201che was immediately met with instant hostility and obvious resentment by defendants,\u201d according to the lengthy complaint.",
      "At the time, Fajardo had been raising concerns about his pay \u2014 first that his employers weren't properly withholding taxes or providing a paystub, then that they shortchanged him by $300, according to the complaint.",
      "Allen, Previn and manager Pamela Steigmeyer are accused in the lawsuit of violating the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and New York labor law, as well as causing Fajardo humiliation, stress and a loss of earnings.",
      "Representatives for Allen did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Fajardo said he was hired after being showered with compliments following a meal of roasted chicken, pasta, chocolate cake and apple pie he prepared for the defendants and two guests. According to the complaint, it was only after Previn fired him and he hired a lawyer that he was told his cooking was not up to par, a claim Fajardo said was untrue."

    "story": [
      "The new film \u201cSeptember 5\" is a fictionalized account of ABC\u2019s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics",
      "News junkies will find much to love in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a fictionalized account of ABC\u2019s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics. There are spirited debates about reporting with only one source, use of words like \u201cterrorism\u201d and what to do if violence breaks out during a live shot. There are negotiations with rival networks over satellite usage, disguises and fake badges made to get reels of 16mm film in and out of the locked down Olympic village and plenty of confused men (and a few women) trying to keep up with an ever-escalating situation.",
      "The film is a moment by moment retelling of how a group of sports broadcasters brought this story to the world in real time, despite the technical limitations and their own inexperience across a confusing 22 hours. Everyone came to the studio that night ready for breaking sports news, scores and pre-packaged interviews. Even that was going to be a test for the man running the control room for the first time. Geoffrey Mason, portrayed by John Magaro, was a 28-year-old coordinating producer. Someone wonders about his experience and is assured that he\u2019s covered minor league baseball games.",
      "But in the early hours of Sept. 5, 1972, eight members of a Palestinian group called Black September broke into the Olympic village and attacked the Israeli delegation killing wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano. Some escaped, but nine others were taken hostage.",
      "While the tragedy of the Munich Olympics has certainly been told many times, writer and director Tim Fehlbaum saw an opportunity in the team behind the live broadcast. And he commits fully to staying in the newsroom, with all of its glorious old technologies, from the walkie-talkies they used to stay in touch and to taking time to show how they had to manually add text to the screens. He and his screenwriter were able to reconstruct the events almost minute-by-minute, which helped shape the screenplay.",
      "The players are many in this large ensemble. Peter Sarsgaard, who\u2019s looked right in a newsroom since \u201cShattered Glass,\u201d gives gravitas to Roone Arledge, then-president of ABC Sports, and Ben Chaplin is operations engineer Marvin Bader. Leonie Benesch is Marianne Gebhardt, a German-speaking interpreter who is the only person there able to understand the language of the country. She might be a bit of a composite who checks off a lot of boxes as both an entrepreneurial woman and a younger German offering perspective and insight into what this moment might mean for the country trying to put on a good front in the aftermath of World War II. An actor (Benjamin Walker) plays broadcaster Peter Jennings, and real archival footage of anchor Jim McKay from that day is used in the film.",
      "And while they all rise to the occasion, mistakes are made \u2013 including a rather big one at the end, following imperfect secondhand information from the Fuerstenfeldbruck airfield. They don\u2019t call it the first draft of history for nothing, after all, and it may be illuminating for audiences to see how it\u2019s handled.",
      "The film looks of its time, but it also feels fairly modern in its sensibilities which makes it always seem more like a re-telling than an in-the-moment experience. This may be to its detriment, yet it\u2019s still an undeniably riveting and compelling watch. The word thrilling doesn\u2019t seem appropriate, however. This is not \u201cApollo 13\u201d after all. The end is not a happy one.",
      "But at time when trust in the media is in crisis, this film is a great humanizer, reminding audiences that the media is far from a monolith, but a group of individuals under immense pressure to get the story right, get the story out and go back and do it again the next day.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 94. Three stars out of four."

      "A federal judge in Utah has sentenced Louisiana rap artist NBA Youngboy to just under two years in prison on gun-related charges after he acknowledged having possessed weapons despite having a felony conviction",
      "LOGAN, Utah -- A federal judge in Utah sentenced Louisiana rap artist NBA Youngboy to just under two years in prison on gun-related charges after he acknowledged having possessed weapons despite being a convicted felon.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden, reached an agreement that resolved Utah state charges against him and settled two sets of federal charges against him \u2014 one carries a 23-month sentence and the other orders five years of probation and a $200,000 fine.",
      "Gaulden, 25, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reached the agreement with federal prosecutors in September, and he and the attorneys signed the deal Tuesday, court documents show.",
      "The rapper acknowledged that, while filming a rap video in Baton Rouge, he possessed a Glock 21 .45-caliber pistol and a Masterpiece Arms MPA30T 9mm handgun. Also, he said, in April he possessed a Sig Sauer 9mm semi-automatic pistol at his home in Huntsville, Utah. He agreed to give up the guns.",
      "Gaulden had previously been convicted in Louisiana of aggravated assault with a firearm, according to his statement released in advance of the plea agreement.",
      "Utah agents raided Gaulden\u2019s home in April amid a complaint that he had posed as a doctor in an effort to obtain prescription painkillers, multiple news outlets reported. As part of the federal plea deal, he would plead guilty to 10 state charges and be sentenced to time served plus a $25,000 fine.",
      "Gaulden apologized to the court and his family before federal Judge Howard Nielson handed down the sentence, KSL.com reported.",
      "\u201cI let my situation get the best of me,\u201d Gaulden said. He added, \u201cI take full responsibility.\u201d",
      "Nielson said he hopes Gaulden will get to a place where he can make decisions that are \u201ctotally unfettered\u201d by substances, noting that he would have to \u201cwalk the straight and narrow\" by completing court-ordered substance abuse treatment and mental health evaluations.",
      "\u201cThis has been a long road that involved extensive litigation and ultimately extensive negotiation,\u201d Atlanta attorney Drew Findling said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cKentrell\u2019s defense team is very happy for Kentrell and we look forward to his many future successes.\u201d"

      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer",
      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer. But there's something this slab of human beef can't do: Anchor a decent movie.",
      "Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the titular hero in \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d the sixth attempt in Sony's sputtering efforts to stock enemies for Spider-Man in movies that don't feature the webslinger. It's stuck in time, a callback to years ago when convoluted superhero origin stories were hot, and studios were dusting off even the poorest IP to tell stories.",
      "The screenplay by Richard Wenk, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway attempts to build the backstory of Kraven but soon loses interest and begins adding origin stories for third-rate bad guys, like The Rhino and The Foreigner, before introducing Chameleon right at the end, as if another Kraven movie is coming. (Sony, make it stop).",
      "Kraven, we learn, was born Sergei Kravinoff, the son of a Russian mobster who is turned into a superhero in a laughably weird plot twist. After being attacked by a lion on safari in Ghana, he's given a mystical botanical serum mixed with lion's blood and some mumbo jumbo about a tarot card. Clinically dead for three minutes, Kraven wakes up and is a world-class hunter. At least that's what he keeps saying.",
      "\u201cHunting people down is kind of my thing,\u201d he says. And later: \u201cI am the greatest hunter on the planet.\u201d Soon he's assassinating bad guys, but his motives aren't always clear. Hunting isn't exactly the same as infiltrating a high-security Siberian prison and killing a cartel boss.",
      "Director J.C. Chandor has a very lose hand, never shaping a taut narrative or reining in his actors and sometimes letting scenes just sort of drop. The additional villains distract from what seems to be a meditation on masculinity, and the special effects are jerky and ludicrous, like a fistfight between Kraven and The Rhino \u2014 somehow still wearing pants \u2014 that prompted some laughter at a recent screening.",
      "Part of the problem is that Kraven's powers aren't clearly defined. He\u2019s supposed to use animal skills to hunt, but are there many four-legged predators out there proficient with a blow dart or a pen to the trachea? He hates poachers but wears a tooth necklace and a leather bomber jacket.",
      "Kraven's eyes sometimes glow but with no apparent benefit other than to make Taylor-Johnson look even more badass as he glares into the camera, shirtless. He does have the ability to focus his attention on faraway objects, like when he spots a dropped cigarette and identifies it as a Turkish brand, a skill really low on the superhero must-haves.",
      "The movie suggests Kraven can communicate with animals, like Aquaman, but, if so, he's really, really bad at it. At best, they just sort of tolerate him. A tiger at one point jumps him and you can't blame it.",
      "Kraven has been shaped largely in opposition to his drug kingpin dad played by Russell Crowe, who has apparently watched \u201cThe Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\u201d to nail his thick, comical Russian accent. \u201cNever fear death,\u201d he tells his son. \u201cMan who kill legend, become legend.\u201d",
      "Crowe's dad is a whisky-neat, all-testosterone, Tony Bennett-loving guy who detests any sign of weakness or kindness. He kills animals for fun, uses cocktail waitresses as human shields, doesn't pay ransoms because that makes him seem soft and dismisses his wife's suicide with the comment: \u201cShe was weak.\u201d",
      "If Crowe is cartoonish to the point of parody, Alessandro Nivola as a human-rhino hybrid makes him look like Sir Laurence Olivier. There are few instances of someone overacting more in a movie, unnecessarily adding an undercurrent of murderous, jokey psychotic to an already bizarre creation. The costume department has also dropped the ball here, giving The Rhino a small, stringed backpack that looks like it was found in the discount bins at Kohl\u2019s.",
      "Two good actors \u2014 Fred Hechinger as Kraven's younger brother and Ariana DeBose as his lawyer-ally \u2014 are left marooned in a movie that tumbles and slips to a unsatisfactory end. Is Kraven a hero or a villain? Who cares? Without Spider-Man, what's really the point, right?",
      "\u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d a Sony Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong bloody violence and language.\u201d Running time: 127 minutes. One star out of four."

      "IRVING, Texas -- A rape allegation against rapper Jay-Z, whose company Roc Nation has produced some of the NFL's entertainment presentations including the Super Bowl halftime show, won\u2019t impact the league's relationship with the music mogul.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the civil allegations and Jay-Z\u2019s really strong response to that,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday after the conclusion of the league's winter meetings. \"We know the litigation is happening now. From our standpoint, our relationship is not changing with them, including our preparations for the next Super Bowl.\u201d",
      "A woman who previously sued Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, alleging she was raped at an awards show after-party in 2000 when she was 13 years old, amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z was also at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, said the rape allegation made against him is part of an extortion attempt. The 24-time Grammy Award winner called the allegations \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cheinous in nature\u201d in a statement released by Roc Nation, one of his companies.",
      "The NFL teamed up with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation in 2019 for events and social activism. The league and the entertainment company extended their partnership a few months ago.",

      "Beyonce, who is married to Jay-Z, will perform at halftime of the Baltimore Ravens-Houston Texans game on Christmas.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re getting incredibly comfortable with not just with the Super Bowl but other events they\u2019ve advised us on and helped us with,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a big help in the social justice area to us on many occasions. They\u2019ve been great partners.\u201d",

      "Specially trained miniature horses visit hospital wards and residential care homes in the Greek capital, providing pet therapy to sick and disabled children and adults",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl\u2019s face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse.",
      "Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway.",
      "\u201cI really want them to come again,\u201d Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. \u201cThey made me feel really happy.\u201d",
      "Ivi and Calypso are two of eight miniature horses from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes.",
      "Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the tiny equines, which stand about 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes.",
      "But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet \u2014 run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team.",
      "Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued.",
      "When she saw photos of the charity\u2019s work in pediatric oncology wards, \u201cI was touched and I was moved, and I said: \u2018OK, we have to bring this to Greece,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013.",
      "Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of eight horses \u2014 the American six, one that was later born in Greece, and Billy, the rescued pony.",
      "Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small caf\u00e9 and an area to host children\u2019s parties and baptisms.",
      "At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs \u2013 specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program.",
      "From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children.",
      "But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the caf\u00e9 and hasn\u2019t been able to re-open since.",
      "With even the tiny income from the caf\u00e9 drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 \u00bd years, \u201cwe fell apart,\u201d she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just starting to get myself back together again now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I\u2019m trying.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly,\u201d Karagianni said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can. But I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it without a team.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe saw things we didn\u2019t expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the ponies get close to them,\u201d Volikaki said. \u201cAnd we saw \u2026 spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn\u2019t see.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while sheriff\u2019s deputies pushed him into a courthouse.",
      "There\u2019s no indication Mangione was ever insured by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an interview Thursday with NBC New York.",
      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.",
      "Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione\u2019s arrest, but little information has emerged about his recent mental and physical health.",
      "Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts reference a spinal condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when a fracture causes a vertebra to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on spinal nerves.",
      "The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione\u2019s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.",
      "After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a theme in his time there,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a big complainer. So it wasn\u2019t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.\u201d",
      "In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.",
      "\u201cI got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20\u2019s and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to his posts, the operation was a success.",
      "An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal rod and multiple screws inserted into his lower spine.",
      "\u201cSurgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,\u201d Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. \u201cObviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.\u201d",
      "Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.",
      "\u201cIn the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,\u201d said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Center at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",
      "Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.",
      "\u201cIf you have underlying mental health issues \u2014 anxiety, depression \u2014 your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,\u201d Gulur said. \u201cBut, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "Little is known about Mangione\u2019s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.",
      "His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November, police said.",
      "Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain fog and restless sleep.",
      "In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, \u201cstaying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn\u2019t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.",
      "He posted in early April about the gear he brought on a two-month backpacking trip through Asia that included some cross-country motorcycling, saying he had found \u201cthe perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.\u201d",
      "In late April, he advised another Reddit user with a back problem to \u201ckeep trying different surgeons\u201d and, if necessary, convey an inability to keep working.",
      "\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d",

      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told NBC New York in an interview Thursday that investigators have uncovered evidence that Luigi Mangione had prior knowledge UnitedHealthcare was holding its annual investor conference in New York City.",
      "Mangione also mentioned the company in a note found in his possession when he was detained by police in Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cWe have no indication that he was ever a client of United Healthcare, but he does make mention that it is the fifth largest corporation in America, which would make it the largest healthcare organization in America. So that\u2019s possibly why he targeted that company,\u201d said Kenny.",
      "UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S. health insurer.",
      "Mangione remains jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday after being spotted at a McDonald's in the city of Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City. His lawyer there, Thomas Dickey, has said Mangione intends to plead not guilty. Dickey also said he has yet to see evidence decisively linking his client to the crime.",
      "Mangione's arrest came five days after the caught-on-camera killing of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel.",
      "Police say the shooter waited outside the hotel, where the health insurer was holding its investor conference, early on the morning of Dec. 4. He approached Thompson from behind and shot him before fleeing on a bicycle through Central Park.",
      "Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him back to New York so that he can face a murder charge in Thompson's killing. A hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 30.",
      "The 26-year-old, who police say was found with a \u201c ghost gun \u201d matching shell casings found at the site of the shooting, is charged in Pennsylvania with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police.",
      "Mangione is an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family. In posts on social media, Mangione wrote about experiencing severe chronic back pain before undergoing a spinal fusion surgery in 2023. Afterward, he posted that the operation had been a success and that his pain had improved and mobility returned. He urged others to consider the same type of surgery.",
      "On Wednesday, police said investigators are looking at his writings about his health problems and his criticism of corporate America and the U.S. health care system.",
      "Kenny said in the NBC interview that Mangione's family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November."

      "In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, Donald Trump weighs in on Jan. 6 pardons, immigration issues and world affairs",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump was on the verge of backing a 16-week federal abortion ban earlier this year when aides staged an intervention.",
      "According to Time magazine's cover story on his selection as its 2024 Person of the Year, Trump's aides first raised concerns in mid-March that the abortion cutoff being pushed by some allies would be stricter than existing law in numerous states. It was seen as a potential political liability amid ongoing fallout over the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that includes three justices nominated by Trump in his first term.",
      "Trump political director James Blair went to work assembling a slide deck \u2014 eventually titled \u201cHow a national abortion ban will cost Trump the election\" \u2014 that argued a 16-week ban would hurt the Republican candidate in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the magazine reported.",
      "\u201cAfter flipping through Blair\u2019s presentation\" on a flight to a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in April, Trump dropped the idea, according to the report. \"So we leave it to the states, right?\" Trump was quoted as saying. He soon released a video articulating that position.",
      "At the time, Trump\u2019s campaign denied that he was considering supporting the 16-week ban, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and saying Trump planned to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion if elected to the White House.",
      "Here are other highlights from the story and the president-elect's 65-minute interview with the magazine:",
      "Trump reaffirmed his plans to pardon most of those convicted for their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons. \u201cMaybe the first nine minutes.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would look at individuals on a \u201ccase-by-case\" basis, but that \u201ca vast majority of them should not be in jail.\u201d",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump insisted he has the authority to use the military to assist with his promised mass deportations, even though, as his interviewers noted, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military in domestic law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help.\"",
      "Trump did not deny that camps would be needed to hold detained migrants as they are processed for deportation.",
      "\u201cWhatever it takes to get them out. I don\u2019t care,\" he said. \u201cI hope we\u2019re not going to need too many because I want to get them out and I don\u2019t want them sitting in camp for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Trump told Time he does not plan to restore the policy of separating children from their families to deter border crossings, but he did not rule it out. The practice led to thousands of children being separated from their parents and was condemned around the globe as inhumane.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll have to because we will send the whole family back,\u201d he said. \u201cI would much rather deport them together, yes, than separate.\u201d",
      "Trump dismissed the idea that Elon Musk will face conflicts of interest as he takes the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory group that Trump has selected him to lead. The panel is supposed to find waste and cut regulations, including many that could affect Musk's wide-ranging interests, which include electric cars, rockets and telecommunications.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\" Trump said. \u201cI think that Elon puts the country long before his company. ... He considers this to be his most important project.\"",
      "Trump lowered expectations about his ability to drive down grocery prices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to bring them down. It\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up. You know, it\u2019s very hard. But I think that they will,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said he is planning \u201ca virtual closure\" of the \"Department of Education in Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to need some people just to make sure they\u2019re teaching English in the schools,\" he said. \u201cBut we want to move education back to the states.\u201d",
      "Yet Trump has proposed exerting enormous influence over schools. He has threatened to cut funding for schools with vaccine mandates while forcing them to \u201cteach students to love their country\" and promote \u201cthe nuclear family,\u201d including \u201cthe roles of mothers and fathers\u201d and the \u201cthings that make men and women different and unique.\u201d",
      "Asked to clarify whether he was committed to preventing the Food and Drug Administration from stripping access to abortion pills, Trump replied, \u201cIt\u2019s always been my commitment.\u201d",
      "But Trump has offered numerous conflicting stances on the issue, including to Time.",
      "Earlier in the interview, he was asked whether he would promise that his FDA would not do anything to limit access to medication abortion or abortion pills. \"We\u2019re going to take a look at all of that,\u201d he said, before calling the prospect \u201cvery unlikely.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve stated it very clearly and I just stated it again very clearly. I think it would be highly unlikely. I can\u2019t imagine, but with, you know, we\u2019re looking at everything, but highly unlikely. I guess I could say probably as close to ruling it out as possible, but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to do anything now.\u201d",
      "Pressed on whether he would abandon Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia's invasion, Trump said he would use U.S. support for Kyiv as leverage against Moscow in negotiating an end to the war.",
      "\u201cI want to reach an agreement,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way you\u2019re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.\u201d",
      "Trump would not commit to supporting a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state alongside Israel, as he had previously.",
      "\u201cI support whatever solution we can do to get peace,\" he said. \"There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can\u2019t go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he trusted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told Time: \u201cI don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d",
      "Trump would not rule out the possibility of war with Iran during his second term. \u201cAnything can happen. It\u2019s a very volatile situation,\" he said.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Nov. 5 election, Trump continued to play coy: \"I can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s just inappropriate.\u201d",
      "Trump insisted that his bid to install Matt Gaetz as attorney general \u201dwasn\u2019t blocked. I had the votes (in the Senate) if I needed them, but I had to work very hard.\u201d",
      "When the scope of resistance to the former Republican congressman from Florida became clear, Trump said, \u201cI talked to him, and I said, \u2018You know, Matt, I don\u2019t think this is worth the fight.'\"",
      "Gaetz pulled out amid scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations, and Trump tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the Cabinet post.",
      "Trump, who has named anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, did not rule out the possibility of eliminating some childhood vaccinations even though they have been proved safe in extensive studies and real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades and are considered among the most effective public health measures in modern history.",
      "Pressed on whether \u201cgetting rid of some vaccinations\u201d \u2014 neither Trump nor the interviewers specified which ones \u2014 might be part of the plan to improve the health of the country, Trump responded: \u201cIt could if I think it\u2019s dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very controversial in the end.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there could be, yeah,\" Trump said of the prospect of others in his family continuing in his footsteps.",
      "He pointed to daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who served as co-chair of the Republican National Committee and is now being talked about as a potential replacement for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Trump has chosen for secretary of state.",
      "Trump said the former and soon-to-be first lady Melania Trump will be joining him at the White House during second term and will \"be active, when she needs to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very beloved by the people, Melania. And they like the fact that she\u2019s not out there in your face all the time for many reasons.\u201d"

    "summary": "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid certain surgeries",
    "story": [
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid certain surgeries",
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid specific surgeries, according to two studies exploring ways to lessen treatment burdens.",
      "One new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, examines whether removing lymph nodes is always necessary in early breast cancer. Another in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests a new approach to a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS.",
      "The research was discussed Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.",
      "Every year, about 50,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, where the cells that line milk ducts become cancerous, but the nearby breast tissue remains healthy. Many choose to have surgery, although it\u2019s unclear whether they could instead take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach with more frequent monitoring.",
      "The new study, based on two years of data, suggests that such active monitoring is a safe alternative to surgery for many of these women, though some doctors will want to see if the results hold up over time.",
      "\u201cThis is an option that patients should consider for their DCIS,\u201d said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor a long time, we\u2019ve had the feeling that we\u2019re overtreating some patients with DCIS. This is a confirmation of what we suspected is happening.\u201d",
      "Taking a more cautious view, Dr. Monica Morrow of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study, said a two-year study isn't long enough to draw conclusions.",
      "The finding is based on following more than 950 U.S. patients randomly assigned to surgery or active monitoring. All had low-risk DCIS with no sign of invasive cancer. They had the type of DCIS that responds to hormone-blocking drugs and many in the study took those drugs as part of their treatment.",
      "After two years, the rates of invasive cancer were low and did not differ significantly between the groups, with about 6% in the surgery group and about 4% in the monitoring group diagnosed with invasive cancer.",
      "Among patients in the monitoring group, changes spotted on a mammogram would prompt a biopsy. They also could opt for surgery at any time for any reason.",
      "Some study participants didn\u2019t stick with the treatment they were randomly assigned. So in a separate analysis looking at those who actually had surgery or not, the rates of invasive cancer were about 9% for the surgery group and 3% for the monitoring group.",
      "The researchers will continue to follow the patients to see if the finding holds up over a decade.",
      "Tina Clark, 63, of Buxton, Maine, joined the study after being diagnosed with DCIS in 2019. Randomly assigned to the monitoring-only group, she was able to avoid surgery and radiation during a time when she was raising a teenage nephew and going through the illness and death of her husband.",
      "\u201cI feel just so grateful and fortunate that I found this study when I did,\u201d Clark said.",
      "She has mammograms every six months to keep watch on the DCIS in her right breast, which has not advanced. The mammograms spotted a small cancer in her other breast in 2023, unrelated to the DCIS. She had a lumpectomy to remove it.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re diagnosed with low-risk DCIS, you have time to understand more about your disease and understand what your options are,\u201d said study author Dr. Shelley Hwang of Duke University School of Medicine.",

      "Nigeria is the latest African country to give a new malaria vaccine to young childen",
      "BAYELSA, Nigeria -- Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child.",
      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",
      "Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases.",
      "According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths.",
      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",
      "There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University.",
      "Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate malaria.",
      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",

      "Fewer grandparents were taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in the number of preschoolers and more people were staying put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s",
      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compare the years 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely because opioid-related deaths stabilized and then declined during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life \u2014 either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelley said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens hitting 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from nearly 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared with the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

      "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes says she is suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness over what she calls \u201cexcessive pumping\u201d of groundwater",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county.",
      "The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts of water that accelerated depletion of the basin\u2019s aquifer. The company is a subsidiary of Saudi dairy giant Almarai Co.",
      "\u201cWe find the allegations of the Attorney General totally unfounded, and we will defend any potential action against Fondomonte and our rights vigorously before the competent authorities,\u201d Fondomonte said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe company has invested significantly to bring the latest conservation technology and applies environmentally sustainable practices on these long-established farms,\u201d it said. \u201cFondomonte has continued to develop responsibly during its time farming in the state and the company complies with all state regulations. \u201d",
      "Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater \u2014 long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction \u2014 even more important for users across the state.",
      "\u201cProtection of Arizona\u2019s precious groundwater is certainly important, but this lawsuit could open a can of worms,\u201d said Kathryn Sorensen, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cNearly every farm, city, mine, tribe, and power company in the state relies on groundwater.\u201d",
      "Water attorneys said they did not feel qualified to address the legal theory of public nuisance but emphasized the lack of regulation of groundwater pumping in rural Arizona.",
      "Kathleen Ferris, an attorney and Arizona water policy expert who directed the study that led to the current law overseeing the state\u2019s groundwater management, said rural groundwater use in the state \u201cis \u201cgoverned by the rule of reasonable use.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone may drill a well and pump groundwater as long as the use of the groundwater is reasonable,\u201d said Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Kyl Center. \u201cUnfortunately, no use of groundwater has been determined by the courts to be \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 It\u2019s basically a rule that benefits the biggest landowners with the deepest wells.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mayes told reporters Wednesday that the Arizona Legislature has done nothing to fix the groundwater problem despite knowing about the problem for years.",
      "\u201cWhile laws regulating groundwater pumping could have prevented this situation, the legislature\u2019s inaction has allowed the crisis to grow,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cWhen the legislature fails to protect our most basic resources, the attorney general must step in.\u201d",
      "La Paz County Supervisor Holly Irwin, a Republican, commended Mayes, a Democrat, for attempting to address what she described as her community\u2019s \u201cmost challenging\u201d concern.",
      "\u201cI know that my constituents will be thrilled over this, that somebody is actually paying attention to the real problems here,\u201d Irwin said during Wednesday\u2019s news briefing via a video conference call.",
      "Mayes' lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte's actions are a public nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures health, obstructs property use, or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by a community.",
      "Mayes called the company\u2019s groundwater pumping \u201cunsustainable\u201d and said it caused \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for people in the area.",
      "\u201cArizona law is clear: no company has the right to endanger an entire community\u2019s health and safety for its own gain,\u201d she said.",

      "Mayes said the dollar figure hasn't been determined but it will be established through the course of litigation.",
      "Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or canceling the company's leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona.

      "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria.",
      "But it\u2019s led to exploitation of children who are often poor and take work in small, illegal mines to support themselves and their families.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including some where children work. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "Some takeaways from AP's report:",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in the pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to six children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them.",
      "None of the children in the group AP saw was attending school. Only two ever had. One, a 5-year-old boy, stopped when he was orphaned. The other was a 6-year-old girl who was pulled out of school by her family, who felt they couldn't afford to send two children to school and prioritized her 11-year-old brother.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. He said the work helps them survive.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "RSIN Nigeria Limited did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited a program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",

      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in these pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse \u2014 all fates Rabiu has seen befall other miners.",
      "\u201cBut it is God that protects,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children\u2019s homes.",
      "In Juliet's group, only she and a 5-year-old boy named Zakaria Danladi had ever attended the local elementary school. Zakaria stopped when he was orphaned. Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said.",
      "Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet\u2019s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty.",
      "Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. \u201cI used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.\u201d He denied the school charges fees.",
      "Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth \u2014 including lithium \u2014 is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor.",
      "\u201cIt is dangerous, but the work helps them survive, while the government has abandoned poor people,\" he said.",
      "Some of the bush miners avoid middlemen like Ibrahim and sell directly to Chinese companies or Chinese nationals.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments.",
      "The Chinese embassy's statement to AP said its government has a zero-tolerance policy toward any illegal mining activity or illegal labor by Chinese companies operating abroad.",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited the program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining.",
      "Abigail Samaniya, 6-year-old Juliet's mother, said she hopes her daughter will someday escape the mine.",
      "\u201cI still want her to go to school, have a better life, work in an office, not a mine forever,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Montana Supreme Court is continuing to block a law that sought to ban gender-affirming medical care for minors while it goes through the courts",
      "HELENA, Mont. -- A Montana law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors will remain temporarily blocked, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, after justices unanimously agreed with a lower court judge who found the law likely violates the state's constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The case against the Montana law now goes to trial before District Court Judge Jason Marks in Missoula.",
      "\u201cI will never understand why my representatives are working to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,\u201d Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy and lead plaintiff, said in a statement. \u201cJust living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office said it looks forward to defending the law, with a spokesperson noting there are recent scientific and legal developments that fall in the state's favor. This comes as the British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria, citing an unacceptable safety risk.",
      "\u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue,\u201d spokesperson Chase Scheuer said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month heard arguments over Tennessee\u2019s ban on puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for transgender minors, with observers saying it appeared the justices were likely to uphold the ban. The Biden administration had sought to block similar bans that exist in more than half the states.",
      "\u201cBecause Montana's constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads,\u201d said Kell Olsen, an attorney for Lambda Legal.",
      "Republican Sen. John Fuller, who sponsored the bill, said Wednesday's decision \u201cis an egregious example of the hyperpartisanship of the Montana Supreme Court.\" He criticized the courts for upholding the \u201cability to sterilize and mutilate children\u201d and denying protection to children \"from unscientific and experimental drugs and operations that have grown increasingly evident as a danger to children.\u201d",
      "Fuller hasn't decided if he will bring a similar bill in the 2025 Legislature.",
      "Legislative debate over Montana\u2019s bill drew national attention in the spring of 2023 after Republicans punished Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr \u2014 the first transgender woman elected to the state\u2019s Legislature \u2014 for admonishing lawmakers who supported the bill.",
      "The Montana Supreme Court \u201chas reaffirmed what we have known all along \u2014 gender-affirming care saves lives, and like all health care decisions, it should be left between doctors and patients,\u201d Zephyr said Wednesday.",
      "Marks blocked the law in late September 2023, just days before it was to take effect. He agreed with transgender youth, their families and health care providers that the law is likely unconstitutional and would harm the mental and physical health of minors with gender dysphoria, rather than protect them from experimental treatments, as supporters said it would.",
      "Marks said he could only conclude the Legislature's stated intent in passing the law was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and it seemed more likely its purpose is to \u201cban an outcome deemed undesirable by the Montana Legislature, veiled as protection for minors.\"",
      "The law sought to prohibit the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. However, cisgender minors would still be able to receive puberty blockers to treat early puberty or surgical procedures to treat intersex conditions, the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Montana is one of at least 26 states that have passed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors and most face lawsuits. Some bans have been temporarily blocked by courts, while others have been allowed to take effect. Fifteen states have enacted protections for gender-affirming medical care for minors.",
      "In Montana\u2019s case, transgender youth argued the law would ban them from continuing to receive gender-affirming medical care, violating their constitutional rights to equal protection, the right to seek health care and the right to dignity. The state Supreme Court upheld the injunction based on the right to privacy, which court rulings have said includes the right to make personal medical decisions free from government interference.",
      "Two justices argued the court should have also clarified that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited by the equal protection clause of the state constitution.",
      "The parents of the plaintiffs argued the law would violate their constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children and two medical providers said it would prevent them from providing effective and necessary care to their patients.",
      "Treatments for gender dysphoria meet standards of care approved by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the ACLU argued in its complaint.",
      "One of the young plaintiffs was dismissed from the lawsuit in September 2024 after turning 18.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the Tennessee ban earlier this month, not in June."

      "LONDON -- The British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication.",
      "The decision, which will be revisited in 2027, effectively bans a common approach to medical gender transitions for youths. It also goes against standards held by medical groups elsewhere, including the European and World Professional Associations for Transgender Health, as well as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The ban will prevent prescribing medications that can suppress or pause puberty in children with gender dysphoria, providing more time to consider options that could include gender reassignment.",
      "The announcement comes after a judge this summer upheld an emergency ban in a ruling that said the treatment was potentially harmful. The emergency ban was put in place by the center-right Conservative government and has now been extended by the center-left Labour government.",
      "The ban does not apply to those already receiving puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, to their use in clinical studies or in treatment of children with precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "It applies across the United Kingdom after consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and an agreement with Northern Ireland.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said a clinical trial will be set up next year to better evaluate use of the drugs.",
      "\u201cWe need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "The National Health Service in England stopped prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics last year, saying there was not enough evidence about the benefits and harms.",
      "In July, Justice Beverley Lang said a review commissioned by the NHS found \u201cvery substantial risks and very narrow benefits\u201d to the treatment.

      "TransActual criticized Wednesday's decision, saying that evidence of danger from 40 years of puberty blockers remains elusive.",

      "While the case is in early stages, police believe the suspect may have been motivated by animus toward the health care industry.",
      "Investigators are looking into an accident that injured Mangione\u2019s back and sent him to an emergency room on July 4, 2023, police said Wednesday. They\u2019re scrutinizing his Facebook page, where he posted X-rays of numerous screws that were inserted into his spine. And police are studying his writings about the injury and his disdain for corporate America and the U.S. health care system.",
      "Authorities recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a three-page, handwritten letter found when he was arrested Monday in Pennsylvania, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was in the notebook.",
      "The letter teased the possibility that clues to the attack \u2014 \u201csome straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it\u201d \u2014 could be found in the notebook, the law enforcement official said. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to disclose information about the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "A law enforcement bulletin obtained by the AP earlier this week said the letter disdained corporate greed and what Mangione called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies. The prep school and Ivy League graduate wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that major corporations' profits continue to rise while life expectancy doesn't, according to the bulletin.",
      "In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione shouted about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d on his way into court Tuesday.",
      "At a brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said that he didn't believe there was evidence to support a forgery charge and questioned whether the gun allegation amounts to a crime. Dickey also said Mangione would contest his extradition to New York and wanted a hearing on the issue.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t rush to judgment in this case or any case,\u201d Dickey said afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s presumed innocent. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald\u2019s customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.",
      "New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference.",
      "There were no fingerprints on the ammunition found at the shooting scene, but work is ongoing to analyze a print on cellphone left nearby, police said Wednesday.",
      "Police are continuing to search for more surveillance video showing Mangione's movements in New York between Nov. 24, when they say he arrived in the city, and the shooting. From video collected already, investigators determined the suspect quickly fled the city, likely by bus, after the killing.",
      "His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at Mangione's Pennsylvania hearing this week that when arrested, he had what are known as Faraday bags for his cellphone and laptop to block signals authorities can use to track electronic devices.",
      "Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he bunked at a co-living space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain.",
      "His relatives have said in a statement that they are \u201cshocked and devastated\" at his arrest.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about taking action to ensure that underserved communities have access to mental health resources,\u201d Gomez said Tuesday at the Academy Women's Luncheon. The singer-actor has been public about her mental health struggles, revealing she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trumbull counties would be used to fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999.",

      "Corrects a previous version that said the judge awarded money to Trump County, rather than Trumbull County."

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Young adult immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d in 19 U.S. states will be temporarily blocked from getting health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's public marketplace, a federal judge has ruled, limiting an effort by the Biden administration to help immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.",
      "Judge Daniel Traynor of the U.S. District Court in North Dakota issued the order Monday from Bismarck, dealing a setback to a Biden administration rule that was estimated to allow 147,000 immigrants to enroll for coverage. Traynor's ruling came in a lawsuit filed over the policy and will remain in effect until the matter can go to trial.",
      "The ruling applies to immigrants in 19 states where Republican attorneys general sued to avoid having to comply with the new policy. They cited concern over immigrants possibly qualifying for public subsidies available to many people insured under the ACA.",
      "The GOP state officials argued that the rule created earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be a strong incentive for immigrants to remain in the U.S. illegally and could creating costs for states. They argued that both the Affordable Care Act and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits flowing to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. However, President-elect Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election promising \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d He will succeed President Joe Biden on Jan. 20.",
      "Traynor, a Trump appointee during his first term in office, concluded through what he called \u201ca common-sense inference\u201d that access to subsidized ACA coverage is a powerful incentive for people to remain in the U.S. illegally, creating a substantial risk that states will \u201csuffer monetary harm.\u201d",
      "Federal law gives CMS the authority to determine whether someone is living in the U.S. legally, but, Traynor wrote, \u201cIt by no means allows the agency to circumvent congressional authority and redefine the term \u2018lawfully present.\u2019\u201d",
      "CMS said in a statement Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit but does not comment on litigation.",
      "Nicholas Esp\u00edritu, deputy legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said some \u201cDreamers\u201d have been waiting for more than a decade to get \u201clife-sustaining\u201d health coverage through the ACA.",
      "\u201cJudge Traynor\u2019s ruling is both disappointing and wrong on the law,\u201d Esp\u00edritu said, promising his group would continue to fight the issue.",
      "But Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach called the decision \u201ca victory for the rule of law.\" He told reporters after a hearing in Bismarck in October that the Biden administration sought to redefine what it means to be an immigrant living in the U.S. legally by \u201cexecutive fiat,\u201d calling the rule \u201cAlice in Wonderland stuff.\u201d",
      "North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley added then that American taxpayers, through Congress, determine how the federal government treats immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t always come across as friendly and nice and cuddly, but it speaks to the access to our health care system, the cost of our health care system, and the burden on the American public, the taxpayer,\u201d he said.",
      "Kansas and North Dakota are the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in August. They've been joined by Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.",

      "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables, all while continuing to limit added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",
      "That's the advice released Tuesday by a panel of nutrition experts charged with counseling the U.S. government about the 2025 edition of the dietary guidelines that will form the cornerstone of federal food programs and policy.",
      "But the 20-member panel didn't weigh in on the growing role of ultraprocessed foods that have been linked to health problems, saying there's not enough evidence to tell people to avoid them. And the group steered clear of updating controversial guidance on alcohol consumption, leaving that analysis to two outside reports expected to be released soon.",
      "Overall, the recommendations for the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans sound familiar, said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert.",
      "\u201cThis looks like every other set of dietary guidelines since 1980: eat your veggies and reduce consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fat,\u201d Nestle said in an email. \u201cThis particular statement says nothing about balancing calories, when overconsumption of calories, especially from ultra-processed foods, is the biggest challenge to the health of Americans.\u201d",
      "The nutrition panel concluded that a healthy diet for people aged 2 years and older is higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and and vegetable oils that are higher in unsaturated fat.",
      "It is lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fat. It may also include fat-free or low-fat dairy and foods lower in sodium and may include plant-based foods.",
      "The panel, which met for nearly two years, was the first to focus on the dietary needs of Americans through what they called a \u201chealth equity lens,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert who was part of the group. That meant considering factors such as household income, race, ethnicity and culture when recommending healthy diets. It will help ensure that the guidance \u201creflects and includes various population groups,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods include the snacks, sugary cereals and frozen meals that make up about 60% of the American diet.",
      "The panel considered more than 40 studies, including several that showed links between ultraprocessed foods and becoming overweight or developing obesity. But the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research, leaving them to conclude that the evidence was too limited to make recommendations.",
      "That decision is likely to bump up against the views of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the nominee to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, who has questioned potential conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines panel and vowed to crack down on ultraprocessed foods that contribute to chronic disease.",
      "The panel also didn't revise recommendations that suggest limiting alcohol intake to two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women.",
      "In 2020, the last time the guidance was updated, the government rejected the advice of scientific advisers to recommend less alcohol consumption.",
      "Two groups \u2014 the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and a committee of the government agency that oversees substance abuse \u2014 are expected to release reports in the coming months on the effects of moderate alcohol use to inform the guidelines.",
      "The advisory panel acknowledged that the diets of most Americans don't meet the current guidelines. More than half of all U.S. adults have one or more diet-related chronic health conditions and 18 million U.S. households have insecure sources of food, according to the report.",
      "\u201cNutrition-related chronic health conditions and their precursors continue to threaten health through the lifespan,\" the report concludes. \u201cWhich does not bode well for the future of health in the United States.\u201d",
      "The scientific report informs the dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. Tuesday\u2019s recommendations now go to HHS and the Agriculture Department, where officials will draft the final guidance set for release next year.",
      "Starting Wednesday, the public will have 60 days to comment on the guidance. HHS and USDA officials will hold a public meeting Jan. 16 to discuss the recommendations.",
      "The new guidance, which will be finalized by the incoming Trump administration, is consistent with decades of federal efforts to reduce diet-related disease in the U.S., said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cBroadly, I think these are well-formulated recommendations that the incoming administration would do well to adopt,\u201d Lurie said.",

      "Her neighborhood reported five cases in six weeks, which she blames on heavy rains at the time and stagnant and accumulated water. One of the cases was her 17-year-old daughter. Plat\u00f3n said she now lights incense and sprays herself with repellant every afternoon.",
      "Puerto Rico officials are urging people to get rid of stagnant water where mosquitoes lay eggs. The government in Trinidad and Tobago has started issuing fines to people whose properties have become breeding sites for mosquitoes.",
      "This year, more than one-third of cases in Costa Rica, Mexico and Paraguay have been reported in children younger than 15, with Guatemala reporting a high number of child deaths, Barbosa said.",

      "Federal officials suggested spending more money and making sure the state's Medicaid program makes adequate payments for programs called assertive community treatments.",
      "Under the prgrams, teams visit people with serious mental illnesses in their home. There is at least one psychiatrist, two psychiatric nurses, specialists in employment and substance abuse, and other professionals.",
      "Research has found the teams often can head off a mental health crisis. They also can provide crisis teams that can respond quickly to prevent bigger issues, from police involvement to psychiatric hospital stays, the Justice Department investigation found.",
      "There are only four teams in South Carolina \u2014 in Columbia, Greenville and Dillon \u2014 and they don't provide statewide coverage. They also have low staffing.",
      "Currently, about 1,000 people live in group homes. A large number of them told federal investigators they wanted to live on their own, but ran into problems.",
      "Federal officials spent months investigating what are officially called community residential care facilities, talking to residents, administrators and people who provide treatment outside the homes for those with mental illnesses who are living independently.",
      "The identities of those who spoke were kept anonymous for their privacy, including one group home resident who pointed out the living conditions weren\u2019t much different than decades ago when people with mental illness were housed in giant centers with no private rooms and little individualized care.",
      "Residents of the group home often only get to leave for a monthly outing to Walmart or Dollar General. They have no way of working because they can\u2019t get transportation to a job. Sometimes the home is fenced in with locked doors and security cameras.",
      "\u201cSomething like a little asylum in here,\u201d the resident told investigators.",
      "The homes are required by law to post calendars with activities. Investigators found almost all of them were events inside the home like arts and crafts, \u201cname that tune,\u201d Bible study, bingo, \u201cbubble-blowing fun\u201d and coloring pages, federal officials told the state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vision of ever getting out. There\u2019s no vision of having a real life. \u2026 There\u2019s no vision of anything. They just feel stuck. That\u2019s almost like hospitals used to be, 150 years ago,\u201d a state employee who regularly visits one home told investigators.",
      "The report cited the case of a 40-year-old man who lived independently for three years when a break-in at his apartment caused a mental health crisis that led to several months in a psychiatric hospital. He was released to a group home, where he has lived for 11 years. He told investigators he wants to live independently but has been offered no help.",
      "A 43-year-old woman told investigators she had a mental crisis in 2020 and went to a group home because her parents thought it would help her rebuild her independence. Now the parents are trying to get her out because she got no help for living skills.",
      "Others had a financial crisis that coincided with a mental crisis and need help with affordable housing or job skills."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world\u2019s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.",
      "The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.",
      "A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.",
      "New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale\u2019s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d van Helden said in a statement.",
      "All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn\u2019t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.",
      "The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.",
      "Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.",
      "\u201cThese little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It\u2019s remarkable to see this and it\u2019s just another thing that we had no idea about,\u201d van Helden said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week I\u2019ll never forget in my life, it\u2019s certainly a highlight and it\u2019s the start of the storytelling around this beautiful animal,\u201d van Helden added.",
      "The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local M\u0101ori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.",
      "Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.",
      "To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature has been treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation.",
      "The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",

      "Specially trained miniature horses visit hospital wards and residential care homes in the Greek capital, providing pet therapy to sick and disabled children and adults",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl\u2019s face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse.",
      "Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway.",
      "\u201cI really want them to come again,\u201d Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. \u201cThey made me feel really happy.\u201d",
      "Ivi and Calypso are two of eight miniature horses from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes.",
      "Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the tiny equines, which stand about 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes.",
      "But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet \u2014 run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team.",
      "Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued.",
      "When she saw photos of the charity\u2019s work in pediatric oncology wards, \u201cI was touched and I was moved, and I said: \u2018OK, we have to bring this to Greece,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013.",
      "Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of eight horses \u2014 the American six, one that was later born in Greece, and Billy, the rescued pony.",
      "Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small caf\u00e9 and an area to host children\u2019s parties and baptisms.",
      "At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs \u2013 specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program.",
      "From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children.",
      "But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the caf\u00e9 and hasn\u2019t been able to re-open since.",
      "With even the tiny income from the caf\u00e9 drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 \u00bd years, \u201cwe fell apart,\u201d she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just starting to get myself back together again now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I\u2019m trying.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly,\u201d Karagianni said.",
      "Running Gentle Carousel single-handedly is taking its toll. \u201cI\u2019m making super-human efforts,\u201d said Karagianni, who at 68 wonders for how long she can go on and is searching for someone to ensure the program\u2019s continuity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can. But I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it without a team.\u201d",
      "Despite her financial struggles, Karagianni said seeing the horses' effect, particularly on children, makes her determined to continue for as long as she can.",
      "During a visit to the Athens special needs primary school, staff lined up children in wheelchairs so each could spend a few moments with the horses. Some reached out to stroke them; others bent their heads forward over the miniature horses for a kiss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the reactions. It\u2019s like something awakens their senses,\u201d said special needs teacher Eleni Volikaki.",
      "The state-run school, which shares facilities with a private charity for disabled children, ELEPAP, caters to children aged 6-14 with cognitive or mobility problems, or both. Anything that encourages the children to make even small hand gestures, such as reaching out to stroke a horse, \u201cis very important for us. Especially when it\u2019s spontaneous and comes directly from the child and isn\u2019t instigated by us,\u201d Volikaki said.",
      "\u201cWe saw things we didn\u2019t expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the ponies get close to them,\u201d Volikaki said. \u201cAnd we saw \u2026 spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn\u2019t see.\u201d",
      "The tiny horses don't just enchant children.",
      "In the seaside area of Nea Makri northeast of Athens, residents of an adult psychiatric care home gather to greet Omiros \u2013 Homer in Greek \u2013 a 12-year-old miniature gray and white stallion with a flowing mane and blue eyes.",
      "Some show their excitement at the long-anticipated visit. Others are shyer at first, but nearly all eventually approach Omiros, leading him around the home\u2019s recreation room or simply whispering to him.",
      "The interaction is invaluable, said social worker Alex Krokidas, who heads the staff at the Iasis home.",
      "\u201cIt offers, even if only briefly, the chance to create a bond that isn\u2019t threatening, that has tenderness, quietness,\u201d Krokidas said. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, these people have faced many difficulties in their lives.\u201d",
      "Meeting Omiros and having a few moments each with him \u201cgives them the opportunity to be a bit calmer, to not feel threatened, to stroke the animal,\u201d Krokidas said. \u201cAll of that is very therapeutic, it is deeply therapeutic.\u201d",
      "Giorgos, one of the residents, initially kept his distance before letting Omiros come close. He leaned his head near the flowing mane.",
      "\u201cHe gave me a beautiful feeling when he was here,\u201d he said after Omiros headed back into the recreation room. \u201cNow that it\u2019s gone, I feel an absence.\u201d",

      "Iran\u2019s capital and outlying provinces have faced rolling power blackouts for weeks in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people\u2019s lives and businesses",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s capital and outlying provinces have faced rolling power blackouts for weeks in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people\u2019s lives and businesses. And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages.",
      "Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement.",
      "The demand on the grid has not let up, however \u2014 even as Iranians stopped using air conditioners as the weather cooled in the fall and before winter months set in, when people fire up their gas heaters.",
      "Meanwhile, bitcoin's value has rocketed to all-time highs after the U.S. election was clinched by Donald Trump. It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining \u2014 sucking away huge amounts of power \u2014 has played a part in the outages in Iran.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, some opportunistic and exploitative individuals use subsidized electricity, public networks and other resources for cryptocurrency mining without authorization,\" Mostafa Rajabi, the CEO of Iran's government-owned power company, said back in August.",
      "Iran\u2019s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities. Then in October and November, rolling power cuts across Tehran's neighborhoods became the norm in daylight hours.",
      "Climate change has been blamed in part, with persisting droughts and less water running through Iranian hydroelectric dams.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered several power plants to stop burning mazut, a high-polluting heavy fuel common in the former Soviet Union countries. Tehran has used it in the past to make up the difference in electricity generation.",
      "Fuel reserves, both in diesel and natural gas, also remain low even though Iran is an OPEC member and home to one of the world's second-largest reserves of natural gas, behind only Russia. There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls.",
      "For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must \"honestly tell the public about the energy situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no choice but to consume energy economically, especially gas, in the current conditions and the cold weather,\u201d he said in mid-November. \u201cI myself use warm clothes at home; others can do the same.\"",
      "Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran \u2014 raising questions where the power is going.",
      "In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power.",
      "And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool.",
      "Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer.",
      "Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. \u201cThey distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,\" Alavi said.",
      "In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally.",
      "Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms.",
      "The farms have caused \u201can abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,\u201d Rajabi said.",
      "The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province \u2014 one of the country's chief manufacturing sites.",
      "Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran. A voice off camera asks how it was possible the electrical company did not discover the farm sooner.",
      "The U.S. Treasury and Israel have targeted bitcoin wallets that they\u2019ve alleged are affiliated with operations run by Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to finance allied militant groups in Mideast war zones.",
      "That suggests the Guard itself \u2014 one of the most-powerful forces within Iran \u2014 may be involved in the mining.",
      "In contrast, Iranian media nearly every day report on individual mining operations being raided by police.",
      "Iran may see bitcoin as a hedge against increased pressure from the incoming Trump administration and as regional allies are engulfed in turmoil, said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "\"The question for the economists inside Iran is do we trust this enough to fund the government,\" said Nephew, who has long worked on Iran issues and sanction strategies in the U.S. government.",
      "However, he cautioned against thinking of bitcoin as a magic bullet for Iran, particularly as bitcoin wallets can be targeted in sanctions.",
      "\u201cA pattern of behavior screams out to intelligence services,\" Nephew said. \"It screams out to bank compliance departments.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's new state agency for nonlethal military procurement is an example of the type of reform that the country hopes will clear the path toward NATO",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry unveiled a new state agency for its armed forces last year. It was the government's answer to the rampant corruption within the ministry's procurement companies, and meant to be a driver of reform on the elusive path toward NATO membership.",
      "The enterprise, in charge of purchasing nonlethal military goods such as food, clothes and fuel, has already contracted 95% of the products requested for supply, and saved 25% in the process, says Arsen Zhumadilov, the CEO of the State Logistics Operator, known by the local abbreviation DOT. Soon, he says, DOT also will begin procuring drones.",
      "It's an example of the type of reform that Ukraine hopes will help clear the path toward NATO, a key deterrent against Russia, officials have argued. Membership in the alliance remains largely a political question, with key states reluctant to grant it, fearing escalation from Moscow.",
      "Western officials are also keenly awaiting the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before making declarations. But NATO officials have also demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join.",
      "Change has been a difficult pill for many within Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet institutions to swallow.",
      "DOT's promising results so far stand in contrast to the deeply-rooted challenges that continue to plague the tenure of Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, including slow progress with restructuring the institution and ongoing allegations of corruption within lethal military procurement.",
      "Western officials are closely monitoring DOT, three Western diplomats told The Associated Press. So far, they have been pleased with the results one year since it was formed. They spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about their assessments.",
      "DOT embodies the uneasy coexistence of a digital-savvy youthful ethos and paper-heavy post-Soviet bureaucracy. Its office exudes a fresh startup culture vibe, while catering to one of the most stubbornly rigid ministries in the country. The contrast underscores the spirit of how Russia's war in Ukraine is being fought, in which innovative drone wars coincide with World War II-style trenches.",
      "\u201cWe understand that we have been on the radars of NATO, of G7 (Group of Seven) countries, of all NATO member countries in terms of whether we manage or not to put in place a procurement system that is resilient, that is effective, efficient, and that is not prone to corruption,\u201d Zhumadilov said.",
      "Nonlethal military purchases became the focus of two corruption scandals under the leadership of Oleksii Reznikov, the previous defense minister. The first involved inflated prices for food supplies and the other was connected to low-quality winter jackets.",
      "Umerov, Reznikov\u2019s successor, has described DOT as not just a new agency, but as the beginning of a new public procurement architecture in Ukraine\u2019s defense sector. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically tasked Umerov to increase transparency in defense procurement where corruption has always been rife.",
      "Zhumadilov, an influential public figure with Crimean Tatar origins known for spearheading reforms in public procurement, was selected because of his previous track record of success. He previously headed Ukraine's procurement of medical supplies.",
      "Plastered on the wall of the agency is a mood board devised by the company's marketing department.",
      "A photo of a military vehicle is placed next to a snaking jungle dirt road, a drone in flight next to a fluffy puppy in midair, a Rubik's Cube and a designer candle. Staff wear oversized hoodies and T-shirts, a contrast to the military fatigues adorned by ministry officials.",
      "DOT\u2019s answer to increasing transparency is DOT-Chain, an IT system that manages the army\u2019s supply demands by digitizing the entire process, from the submission of applications to issuing invoices. Developed by a team of DOT IT specialists, it could reduce delivery time fourfold and is the largest digital project in the institution. For now it will cover foodstuff, but Zhumadilov envisions scaling it up.",
      "There were blips on the road. A planned merger with the Defense Procurement Agency, the state company in charge of purchasing lethal military supplies, was aborted after NATO officials recommended against it, casting Umerov\u2019s decision-making in negative light.",
      "Acknowledging that corrupt practices in defense purchases has plagued Ukraine for years, Umerov has said the state needed to eliminate the \u201cSoviet, oligarchic\u201d approach to public funds.",
      "But, like most things in the war, that is easier said than done.",
      "Zhumadilov said their company still faces resistance from ministry officials set in their old ways.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to be open to our colleagues at Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but at the same time, and this is also good news, we are an autonomous agency within a larger ecosystem, we can preserve our own culture here.\u201d",
      "DOT-Chain, which was designed to lower the burden of army paperwork, for instance, still faces pushback from bureaucrats who prefer signing thousands of papers per week to clicking a smartphone.",
      "\u201cThey say that we don\u2019t need that. We just want to keep on signing papers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are saying, \u2018Look, the sheer amount of papers that you are signing on a weekly basis \u2026 it is just unsustainable.\u2019\u201d",

      "A prominent human rights attorney has quietly parted ways with the International Criminal Court to protest what he sees as an unjustified failure of its chief prosecutor to indict members of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government for crimes a...",
      "MIAMI -- A prominent human rights attorney has quietly parted ways with the International Criminal Court to protest what he sees as an unjustified failure of its chief prosecutor to indict members of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2019s government for crimes against humanity, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The Chilean-born Claudio Grossman, a former law school dean at American University in Washington and past president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, was appointed special adviser to ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan in November 2021. In that unpaid position, he advised Khan on the deteriorating human rights situation in Venezuela.",
      "In a harshly worded email last month to Khan, Grossman said his ethical standards no longer allow him to stand by silently as Maduro\u2019s government continues to commit abuses, expel foreign diplomats and obstruct the work of human rights monitors from the United Nations \u2014 without any action from the ICC.",
      "\u201cI can no longer justify the choice not to take correspondingly serious action against the perpetrators of the grave violations,\u201d Grossman wrote in an email rejecting an offer by Khan's office in September to renew his contract.",
      "A copy of the email, which has not been made public, was provided to the AP by someone familiar with the ICC investigation into Venezuela. A phone call by Khan asking Grossman to reconsider also failed, according to the person on the condition of anonymity to discuss the politically sensitive investigation.",
      "Following AP's inquiries with Khan's office, Grossman's name was removed from the court's website listing him as a special adviser.",
      "\u201cThe Prosecutor is extremely grateful to Professor Grossman for the expertise and work he has rendered,\u201d the prosecutor's office said in a statement without addressing Grossman's stated reasons for cutting ties with the court based in The Hague, Netherlands. Grossman declined to comment.",
      "The pressure on Khan to indict Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, comes as he battles allegations of misconduct with a female aide and the threat of U.S. sanctions over his decision to seek the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza.",
      "The Rome Statute that established the court took effect in 2002, with a mandate to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide \u2014 but only when domestic courts fail to initiate their own investigations.",
      "Calls for faster progress in the court's only ever investigation in Latin America have grown louder as Maduro tightens his grip on power, preparing to be sworn in for a third term Jan. 10 following an election marred by serious allegations of ballot box fraud and a post-election crackdown. More than 2,000 people were arrested and 20 killed following the vote.",
      "The U.S. and even some fellow leftist leaders in Latin America have demanded authorities present voting records, as they have in the past, to refute tally sheets presented by Maduro\u2019s opponents showing their candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, prevailed by a two-to-one margin.",
      "Many in Venezuela's opposition have complained that the ICC is applying a double standard, moving aggressively to seek the arrest of Netanyahu and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin for atrocities in Gaza and Ukraine while showing undue leniency with Venezuelan officials Khan has been investigating for more than three years.",
      "\u201cThere is no justification whatsoever for the inaction,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado wrote in a recent letter to Grossman and 18 other special advisers to the court appealing for their help.",
      "\u201cWhat is at stake is the life and well-being of Venezuelans,\u201d they added in the letter, which was also provided to the AP by the person familiar with the ICC investigation. \u201cThis unjustifiable delay will cast legitimate doubts about the integrity of a system of accountability that has been an aspiration for the whole world.\u201d",
      "At the request of several Latin American governments, Khan three years ago opened an investigation into Venezuelan security forces\u2019 jailing, torture and killing of anti-government demonstrators. At the same time, he promised technical assistance to give local authorities an opportunity to take action before the ICC, a tribunal of last resort.",
      "Earlier this month, Khan delivered some of his harshest comments to date about the human rights situation in Venezuela, warning that officials\u2019 repeated promises to investigate alleged abuses \u201ccannot be a never-ending story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have not seen the concrete implementation of laws and practices in Venezuela that I hoped for,\u201d he said in a speech at ICC headquarters. \u201cThe ball is in Venezuela\u2019s court. The track of complementarity is running out of road.\u201d",
      "Maduro's government, in response, said in a statement that it \u201cdeeply regrets that the prosecutor is being led astray by campaigns that have emerged on social networks promoted by the extreme right, Zionism and Western powers seeking to apply legal colonialism against Venezuela.\"",
      "Some Venezuelan critics have linked what they view as foot-dragging to a potential conflict of interest involving Khan's sister-in-law, international criminal lawyer Venkateswari Alagendra, who has appeared on behalf of the Venezuelan government in two hearings before the court.",
      "An ICC code of conduct directs prosecutors to abstain from any conflicts that may arise from \u201cpersonal interest in the case, including a spousal, parental or other close family, personal or professional relationship with any of the parties.\u201d Alagendra has previously worked with Khan and his wife defending Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the Libyan dictator, at the ICC.",
      "Khan's office declined to comment about the relationship. But in a filing this month seeking dismissal of a request for recusal filed by the Washington-based Arcadia Foundation, he said a sister-in-law is not a close enough personal relationship requiring automatic disqualification and that he doesn't recall ever discussing the Venezuela probe with Alagendra, who is just one of several attorneys defending the South American government.",
      "\u201cNo fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there is a real possibility of bias,\u201d Khan wrote, adding that he continues to actively and independently investigate the situation in Venezuela.",
      "Those claiming to be victims of the Maduro government have pushed for the court to wrap up its investigation without taking a position on whether Khan should be recused.",
      "After millions of Venezuelans have fled Maduro's rule, many for neighboring countries, regional governments are also anxiously awaiting progress.",
      "\u201cMany in Latin America expect the ICC prosecutor to have a more muscular response,\" said Juan Papier, deputy director for the Americas at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s office has spent too much time, so far fruitlessly, trying to work with Venezuela authorities to push for domestic investigations. Widespread impunity and lack of judicial independence in Venezuela make the ICC the most viable path for justice.\u201d",

    "summary": "Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish &mdash; one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world &mdash; were caught and released in Cambodia recently in just a few days, offering new hope for the survival for the species",
    "story": [
      "Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released in Cambodia recently in just a few days, offering new hope for the survival for the species",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish \u2014 one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world \u2014 were caught and released recently in Cambodia, reviving hopes for the survival of the species.",
      "The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weigh up to 300 kilograms (661 pounds), or as heavy as a grand piano. They now are only found in Southeast Asia's Mekong River but in the past inhabited the length of the 4,900-kilometer (3,044 mile)-long river, all the way from its outlet in Vietnam to its northern reaches in China's Yunnan province.",
      "The species' population has plummeted by 80% in recent decades due to rising pressures from overfishing, dams that block the migratory path the fish follow to spawn and other disruptions.",
      "Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within 5 days, is unprecedented.",
      "The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 2 meters (6.5 feet) that weighed 120 kilograms and 131 kilograms (264 pounds and 288 pounds), respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent, like in the next few years, risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,\u201d said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project.",
      "Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species.",
      "\u201cThis information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,\u201d said Hogan.",
      "The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region\u2019s cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually.",
      "Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them.",
      "\"Their cooperation is essential for our research and conservation efforts,\u201d Heng Kong, director of Cambodia\u2019s Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, said in a statement.",
      "Apart from the Mekong giant catfish, the river is also home to other large fish including the salmon carp, which was thought to be extinct until it was spotted earlier this year, and the giant sting ray.",
      "That four of these fish were caught and tagged in a single day is likely the \u201cbig fish story of the century for the Mekong\u201d, said Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center\u2019s Southeast Asia Program. He said that seeing them confirms that the annual fish migration was still robust despite all the pressures facing the environment along the Mekong.",
      "\u201cHopefully what happened this week will show the Mekong countries and the world that the Mekong\u2019s mighty fish population is uniquely special and needs to be conserved,\u201d he said.",

      "One by one, the toys that show the wear and tear of love are restored for the holidays: sewed and combed, stuffed and dressed",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- The doll\u2019s golden curls are intact and soon her head is, too. One by one, the toys that show the wear and tear of love are restored for the holidays: sewed and combed, stuffed and dressed.",
      "From Barbie dolls to a Kung Fu Panda with a paw raised in triumph, the toys that have been left behind by children are made ready to be gifted once more.",
      "This is the work of the Hospital for Soft Toys, a project in Venezuela's capital.",
      "Its volunteers pick up the pace this time of year. It began with a mother's question: What to do with all the toys once children outgrow them?",
      "Mirady Acosta, a 63-year-old architect who represents the Hospital for Soft Toys, said the idea came from Lilian Gluck, a teacher who in 2017 considered what to do as some of her children left the country.",
      "Throw toys out? Let them fall apart? Neither were good options. She decided to wash them, fix them up and donate them to pediatric patients of the University Hospital of Caracas.",
      "Months later, encouraged by the response, she opened the Hospital for Soft Toys at her home as a nonprofit foundation that also collects and restores other toys and educational games.",
      "About 60 volunteers now meet at least twice a week. The project estimates it has recycled about 70,000 toys in the past seven years.",
      "The foundation also receives donations from abroad that can include school supplies, diapers, shoes, food and candy.",
      "All have been welcome in a country that has seen years of economic crisis and renewed political anxiety after July's election.",
      "Restoring a soft toy's nubby fur or untangling a doll's hair for another round of affection is also helpful for the volunteers.",
      "\u201cBy doing this, all of us who come here are in therapy, a therapy of support for one another,\u201d said Silvia Heiber, 72, who has volunteered for almost three years.",
      "Mirna Morales, a 76-year-old teacher and another volunteer, called it \u201cone of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda Poleo, 84, was mending a giant stuffed animal. The work is not complicated, she said, as they all have been \u201cseamstresses and menders at one time or another.\u201d",
      "On some days it seems the number of toys to repair runs low, but then the doorbell rings. And more boxes and bags have arrived.",
      "The toys are delivered to hospitals and schools in poor neighborhoods, but also to homes for older people \u2014 anyone \u201cwho needs a little bit of affection,\u201d Heiber said.",
      "Each restored toy comes with a message encouraging its new owner to embrace the value of recycling.",
      "\u201cHello, I am your new friend,\" it says. \"I am a doll with experience because I played with another girl. Love me and take care of me and I will do the same with you. When you grow up give me to another girl who will love me and play with me like you.\u201d",

The outages also are blamed on a lack of maintenance and investment in its electric grid for decades.",
      "In addition, Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority is still struggling to restructure more than $9 billion in debt \u2014 the largest of any public agency on the island \u2014 nearly a decade after the government announced it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion debt load."

      "\u201cBBC broadcasts false information aimed at destabilizing social calm and undermining the troops' morale,\u201d communications minister Raliou Sidi Mohamed said in letters to radio stations that rebroadcast BBC content. Mohamed asked the stations to suspend BBC's programs \u201cwith immediate effect.\u201d",
      "The BBC said it had no comment on the suspension.",
      "Popular BBC programs, including those in Hausa \u2014 the most-spoken language in Niger \u2014 are broadcast in the Central African country through local radio partners to reach a large audience across the region.",

      "Niger's authorities denied that an attack happened in the area in a statement read on state television and said it would file a complain against RFI for \u201cincitement to genocide.\u201d",
      "Niger, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Mali, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia\u2019s mercenary units for security assistance.",
      "But the security situation in the Sahel has worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and civilians killed both by Islamic militants and government forces.",
      "Meanwhile, the ruling juntas have cracked down on political dissent and journalists. Earlier this year, Malian authorities banned the media from reporting on the activities of political parties and associations. Burkina Faso suspended the BBC and Voice of America radio stations for their coverage of a mass killing of civilians carried out by the country\u2019s armed forces.",
      "In August 2023, Niger banned French broadcasters France 24 and RFI, a month after its military rulers took power in a coup.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, the three juntas censor the media as soon as the security situation in the country is addressed in an unpleasant manner or when abuses are revealed,\u201d Sadibou Marong, head of the sub-Saharan Africa office of Reporters Without Borders, told The Associated Press in September.",

Security Council.",

      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the deadly strike. Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, which led the attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza. The Israeli military says Hamas militants hide among Gaza\u2019s civilian population.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly's member nations approved a new resolution this week demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they do reflect world opinion \u2014 the vote Wednesday was 158-9, with 13 abstentions.",
      "Photos from the scene in Nuseirat sent to journalists showed a completely collapsed building with people walking through its mangled and charred remains, smoke rising from piles of belongings strewn over the rubble. Palestinian rescuers were searching for more bodies trapped beneath the rubble.",
      "The strikes Thursday evening came as Palestinian medics were still surveying the morning\u2019s deadly toll of fierce Israeli attacks, including on Nuseirat camp. Palestinian medical officials had reported at least 28 people killed earlier in the day, including seven children and a woman. One of the strikes flatted a house in Nuseirat, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken.",
      "Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local aid coordination committees set up by displaced Palestinians and the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, according to health officials at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Eight of the men were killed in an attack near the southern border town of Rafah and the remaining seven were killed by a strike in Khan Younis.",
      "The committees aim to establish secure aid convoys, which often face challenges such as looting, hoarding and profiteering in their efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies to Palestinians facing the risk of famine.",
      "Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it. The U.N. says Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order after Israel repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, make it extremely difficult to operate in the territory.",
      "In Gaza's isolated and devastated north, Awda Hospital said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Jouda, was shot in the head and killed Thursday morning. The Health Ministry said the doctor was killed by an armed quadcopter drone as he was traveling from Kamal Adwan Hospital to treat patients at Awda Hospital.",
      "The two medical facilities are in northern towns where Israel has waged a blistering offensive against Hamas militants since early October, allowing in almost no humanitarian aid and ordering tens of thousands to flee to nearby Gaza City. Experts have warned that the north may be experiencing famine.",
      "The latest bombardment came as Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, was holding official meetings in Israel as signs emerge that long-stalled negotiations between Israel and Hamas could regain momentum. On Thursday, Sullivan revived hopes for a deal, telling reporters in Jerusalem that Israel\u2019s ceasefire in Lebanon has helped clear the way for another deal to end the war in Gaza.",
      "Sullivan plans to travel next to Qatar and Egypt, key mediators in the ceasefire talks, as the Biden administration makes a final push on negotiations before Donald Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Sullivan said \u201cHamas\u2019 posture at the negotiating table did adapt\u201d after Israel decimated the leadership of its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and reached a ceasefire there. \u201cWe believe it puts us in a position to close this negotiation,\u201d he said.",
      "Last month, the U.S. vetoes a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire, objecting that the resolution did not link the truce to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas. The council\u2019s 14 other members supported the resolution.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and his former defense minister bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts.",

      "One of the most prestigious roles in global fashion has just been filled, as Chanel announced Matthieu Blazy as its new artistic director",
      "PARIS -- One of the most prestigious roles in global fashion has just been filled, as Chanel appointed Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy as its new artistic director, the fashion house announced Thursday.",
      "The 40-year-old will oversee all collections for the world's second biggest luxury brand starting in 2025, replacing Virginie Viard, who parted ways with the house earlier this year.",
      "Blazy arrives with a reputation for innovation and craftsmanship, honed through stints at Raf Simons, Maison Margiela and C\u00e9line under Phoebe Philo. Most recently, he was creative director at Bottega Veneta.",
      "Chanel President Bruno Pavlovsky praised his \u201caudacious\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d approach, adding that Blazy would \u201cplay with the codes and heritage of the House\u201d to take it in \u201cexciting new directions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am thrilled and honored,\" said Blazy.",
      "Critics have noted that Blazy\u2019s relatively young age suggests Chanel may be positioning him for a long tenure, akin to the 36 years Karl Lagerfeld spent at the helm. His appointment marks only the fourth designer in Chanel\u2019s over 100-year history to lead the house, following Lagerfeld, Viard, and founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "Viard, who succeeded Lagerfeld after his death in 2019, left earlier this year after more than three decades with the brand \u2014 an abrupt departure, announced in the middle of the night just weeks before the couture show.",
      "For a house known for meticulous image execution, the announcement felt unusually unpolished. Later, it was revealed that Viard would not oversee her final couture presentation, with her team stepping in to handle the collection.",
      "During her tenure, Viard achieved record sales for Chanel, reaching $19.7 billion last year. But her time was not without controversy. Critics often cited her collections as lacking the theatrical flair of Lagerfeld\u2019s era, and backlash to a poorly received mid-season show in Marseille added pressure. Her appointment was initially viewed as temporary.",
      "Critics say that Blazy\u2019s arrival signals a new chapter for Chanel, blending heritage with modernity as the house looks to the future.",
      "Chanel\u2019s Global Executive Chairman Alain Wertheimer and CEO Leena Nair described Blazy as \u201cone of the most gifted designers of his generation.\u201d"

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Belarusian authorities have arrested seven journalists who worked for an independent regional news outlet, a media watchdog said Thursday, the latest move in a sweeping crackdown on dissent and freedom of speech by the country\u2019s authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.",
      "The Belarusian Association of Journalists said the seven \u2014 journalists who worked for Intex-Press online newspaper in the western city of Baranavichy, including its founder Uladzimir Yanukevich \u2014 were arrested earlier this month and charged with \u201csupporting extremist activities.\u201d",
      "Such accusations widely used by the authorities to silence independent voices. Belarus\u2019 law enforcement agencies have launched a new wave of arrests in recent months seeking to uproot any sign of dissent ahead of January\u2019s election in which Lukashenko is seeking a seventh term.",
      "\u201cIt marks the arrest of the largest group of journalist from one media outlet in a year, signaling an escalation of repressions,\u201d said the association's leader, Andrei Bastunets. \u201cIt looks like the authorities have decided to arrest all journalists they suspect of being disloyal ahead of January's presidential vote.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, another independent journalist, Volha Radzivonava, was sentenced to four years in prison for her critical reports chronicling a sweeping crackdown on dissent under Lukashenko.",
      "Belarusian authorities responded to mass protests sparked by the 2020 protests sparked by the widely disputed 2020 vote that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office with a brutal crackdown in which about 65,000 people were arrested.",
      "Leading opposition figures were either been imprisoned or fled the country, and independent media were shut. Human rights activists have said Belarus is holding about 1,300 political prisoners and that many of them are denied adequate medical care and contact with their families.",
      "Like other independent news outlets, Intex-Press faced official pressure for covering the 2020 protests and was later stripped of registration and declared \u201cextremist.\u201d",
      "The Belarusian Association of Journalists said 42 Belarusian journalists are currently in custody on politically-driven charges. Reporters Without Borders, an international media rights watchdog, said Belarus ranks fourth in the world in the number of jailed journalists.",
      "Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for over 30 years by relying on Kremlin subsidies and support, has allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to send troops into neighboring Ukraine in 2022 and to host some of its tactical nuclear weapons."

      "A quarterly survey by Japan's central bank shows business sentiment among manufacturers has improved slightly, especially in major heavy industries such as automaking, fossil fuels and machinery",
      "BANGKOK -- A quarterly survey by Japan\u2019s central bank shows business sentiment has improved slightly, especially in major heavy industries such as automaking, fossil fuels and machinery, while services industries were less upbeat.",
      "The survey released Friday by the Bank of Japan, called the tankan, might influence the central bank's decision on whether to raise its benchmark interest rate next week. It shows the difference between companies saying they are optimistic about business conditions and those that are pessimistic.",
      "The latest survey's outcome undermined expectations for a rate hike, and the Japanese yen weakened, with the U.S. dollar trading at 152.90 yen on Friday, near its highest level in two weeks. Meanwhile, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell more than 1%.",
      "\u201cExpectations are for the BOJ to maintain its short-term interest rate at 0.25% next week, marking the fourth consecutive meeting with no change,\u201d IG said in a commentary.",
      "Japan\u2019s economy grew at a revised 1.2% annual pace in the last quarter, helped by sustained consumer spending. But the outlook ahead is uncertain, IG economists noted, given U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's vows to impose higher tariffs on imports from many countries, which could jolt both the regional and the global economy.",
      "\u201cThe mediocre increase in business conditions across all firm sizes in the latest tankan suggests that activity is unlikely to rebound meaningfully this quarter, following a slowdown in (the last quarter),\u201d Toh Au Yu of Capital Economics said in a commentary.",
      "One of the biggest obstacles for Japanese firms is a severe labor shortage as the work force shrinks along with the overall population, Toh said. The tankan showed a negative 36 sentiment for employment, unchanged from the previous quarter.",
      "Still, overall business sentiment for both manufacturers and non-manufacturers edged up to 15 from 14 in the previous survey.",
      "The sentiment index for large manufacturers rose to 14 in December from 13 in September, partly due to automakers resuming production following certification scandals in the industry.",
      "Construction and real estate also improved.",
      "But while automakers and other big industries gained ground, sentiment among retailers and other service industries deteriorated, falling to 33 from 34, though it remained in positive territory.",
      "The index for retailers dropped sharply, to 13 from 28.",
      "The Bank of Japan began earlier this year to shift away from a negative interest rate policy aimed at keeping credit super cheap to support the economy as the country's population shrinks, sapping demand. The ultra-lax monetary policy was kept in place for years to counter a long spell of deflation, when demand was so slack that prices fell.",
      "But global price increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with a weakening of the Japanese yen against other currencies, has pushed prices above the BOJ's target of about 2% inflation, enabling it to begin shifting to a more conventional stance.",
      "Japan racked up a trade deficit in October for the fourth month in a row, as the weak yen and rising energy prices kept import costs high.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has proposed raising Japan's basic tax-free income allowance, increasing take-home wages and paying subsidies to low-income families to help boost consumer spending.",
      "But his minority government is likely to struggle to gain support from the opposition on budgets and other legislation, raising the risk of political deadlocks that could stymie economic initiatives."

And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages.",
      "Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement.",

It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining \u2014 sucking away huge amounts of power \u2014 has played a part in the outages in Iran.",

      "Iran\u2019s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities.

There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls.",
      "For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must \"honestly tell the public about the energy situation.\u201d",

      "Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran \u2014 raising questions where the power is going.",
      "In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power.",
      "And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool.",
      "Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer.",
      "Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. \u201cThey distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,\" Alavi said.",
      "In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally.",
      "Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms.",
      "The farms have caused \u201can abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,\u201d Rajabi said.",
      "The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province \u2014 one of the country's chief manufacturing sites.",
      "Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran.

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's new state agency for nonlethal military procurement is an example of the type of reform that the country hopes will clear the path toward NATO",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry unveiled a new state agency for its armed forces last year. It was the government's answer to the rampant corruption within the ministry's procurement companies, and meant to be a driver of reform on the elusive path toward NATO membership.",
      "The enterprise, in charge of purchasing nonlethal military goods such as food, clothes and fuel, has already contracted 95% of the products requested for supply, and saved 25% in the process, says Arsen Zhumadilov, the CEO of the State Logistics Operator, known by the local abbreviation DOT. Soon, he says, DOT also will begin procuring drones.",
      "It's an example of the type of reform that Ukraine hopes will help clear the path toward NATO, a key deterrent against Russia, officials have argued. Membership in the alliance remains largely a political question, with key states reluctant to grant it, fearing escalation from Moscow.",
      "Western officials are also keenly awaiting the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before making declarations. But NATO officials have also demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join.",
      "Change has been a difficult pill for many within Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet institutions to swallow.",
      "DOT's promising results so far stand in contrast to the deeply-rooted challenges that continue to plague the tenure of Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, including slow progress with restructuring the institution and ongoing allegations of corruption within lethal military procurement.",
      "Western officials are closely monitoring DOT, three Western diplomats told The Associated Press. So far, they have been pleased with the results one year since it was formed. They spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about their assessments.",
      "DOT embodies the uneasy coexistence of a digital-savvy youthful ethos and paper-heavy post-Soviet bureaucracy. Its office exudes a fresh startup culture vibe, while catering to one of the most stubbornly rigid ministries in the country. The contrast underscores the spirit of how Russia's war in Ukraine is being fought, in which innovative drone wars coincide with World War II-style trenches.",
      "\u201cWe understand that we have been on the radars of NATO, of G7 (Group of Seven) countries, of all NATO member countries in terms of whether we manage or not to put in place a procurement system that is resilient, that is effective, efficient, and that is not prone to corruption,\u201d Zhumadilov said.",
      "Nonlethal military purchases became the focus of two corruption scandals under the leadership of Oleksii Reznikov, the previous defense minister. The first involved inflated prices for food supplies and the other was connected to low-quality winter jackets.",
      "Umerov, Reznikov\u2019s successor, has described DOT as not just a new agency, but as the beginning of a new public procurement architecture in Ukraine\u2019s defense sector. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically tasked Umerov to increase transparency in defense procurement where corruption has always been rife.",
      "Zhumadilov, an influential public figure with Crimean Tatar origins known for spearheading reforms in public procurement, was selected because of his previous track record of success. He previously headed Ukraine's procurement of medical supplies.",
      "Plastered on the wall of the agency is a mood board devised by the company's marketing department.",
      "A photo of a military vehicle is placed next to a snaking jungle dirt road, a drone in flight next to a fluffy puppy in midair, a Rubik's Cube and a designer candle. Staff wear oversized hoodies and T-shirts, a contrast to the military fatigues adorned by ministry officials.",
      "DOT\u2019s answer to increasing transparency is DOT-Chain, an IT system that manages the army\u2019s supply demands by digitizing the entire process, from the submission of applications to issuing invoices. Developed by a team of DOT IT specialists, it could reduce delivery time fourfold and is the largest digital project in the institution. For now it will cover foodstuff, but Zhumadilov envisions scaling it up.",
      "There were blips on the road. A planned merger with the Defense Procurement Agency, the state company in charge of purchasing lethal military supplies, was aborted after NATO officials recommended against it, casting Umerov\u2019s decision-making in negative light.",
      "Acknowledging that corrupt practices in defense purchases has plagued Ukraine for years, Umerov has said the state needed to eliminate the \u201cSoviet, oligarchic\u201d approach to public funds.",
      "But, like most things in the war, that is easier said than done.",
      "Zhumadilov said their company still faces resistance from ministry officials set in their old ways.",

      "The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is likely to bring big changes to seafood, one of the oldest sectors of the U.S. economy",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is likely to bring big changes for one of the oldest sectors of the U.S. economy \u2014 seafood \u2014 and some in the industry believe the returning president will be more responsive to its needs.",
      "Economic analysts paint a more complicated picture, as they fear Trump\u2019s pending trade hostilities with major trading partners Canada and China could make an already pricy kind of protein more expensive to consumers. Conservationists also fear Trump's emphasis on government deregulation could jeopardize fish stocks that are already in peril.",
      "But many in the commercial fishing and seafood processing industries said they are excited for Trump\u2019s second presidency. They said they expect he\u2019ll allow fishing in protected areas as he did in his first presidency, crack down on offshore wind expansion and cut back regulations they describe as burdensome. And they expect a marked shift from the administration of President Joe Biden, who prioritized ocean conservation and championed wind power from the start.",
      "The seafood industry isn't hungry for another tariff war, which hurt fishermen during Trump's first term, said Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association. But she said the new Trump administration has a unique chance to throw its support behind U.S. fishermen.",
      "\u201cI think we should be focused on feeding Americans,\u201d Casoni said. \u201cThe \u2018America First\u2019 administration I think will make that point loud and clear. Know where your food is coming from.\u201d",
      "But the seafood industry, which is international in nature, could be seriously disrupted if Trump goes through with a plan to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada, said John Sackton, a longtime industry analyst and founder of Seafood News. Canada is the largest seafood market for the U.S. for both imports and exports, and nearly a sixth of the seafood imported by the U.S. is from its northern neighbor, according to federal statistics published in November. In total about 80% of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported.",
      "Losing Canada \u2014 an especially important buyer of American lobster \u2014 as a market for U.S. seafood could cause prices to fishermen to collapse, Sackton said. And some products could become unavailable while others become more expensive and still others oversupplied, he said. He described the seafood industry as \u201cinterdependent on both sides of the border.\u201d",
      "In Canada, members of the country's seafood industry are watching closely to see what changes Trump ushers in, said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "\u201cA potential trade war will cost everyone more (in Canada and the U.S.) and cause damage to the seafood section in Canada and the United States,\u201d Irvine said via email. \u201cWe are working with allies in Canada and the U.S. to send this message to all governments.\u201d",
      "One of the major changes for fishermen under a new Trump administration is that they can expect to have a seat at the table when high-level decisions get made, said representatives for several commercial fishing groups. Last time around, Trump sat down with fishermen and listened to their concerns about loss of fishing rights in Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a nearly 5,000-square mile (13,000 square kilometers) protected area off New England, said Robert Vanasse, executive director of industry advocate Saving Seafood.",
      "That goodwill is likely to carry over into Trump's new presidency. And the industry feels it has already scored a win with election of a president who is an outspoken critic of offshore wind power, said Drew Minkiewicz, an attorney who represents the New Bedford, Massachusetts-based Sustainable Scalloping Fund. Fishermen of valuable seafoods such as scallops and lobsters have long opposed offshore wind development because of concerns wind power will disrupt prime fishing grounds.",
      "\u201cThere is excitement in the industry that offshore wind will basically be contained to its existing footprint and nothing beyond that,\u201d Minkiewicz said.",
      "Others in the industry said they're concerned about how Trump will handle the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency that regulates fisheries. The undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, who is currently the Biden-appointed Rick Spinrad, will be one of Trump's key appointees. Trump went through three different administrators at the post during his first term of office.",
      "The industry has recently suffered major recent crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and trade hostilities with another major trading partner in Russia, and isn't in a position to withstand unstable leadership, said Noah Oppenheim, coordinator for Fishing Communities Coalition, which represents small-scale commercial fishing groups.",
      "\"The Fishing Communities Coalition is always deeply concerned that any administration\u2019s shifts away from a fishery management focus on conservation and accountability will do serious lasting damage to the industry,\" Oppenheim said.",
      "Conservation groups who have pushed for stricter vessel speed rules and new fishing standards, such as new gear that is less likely to harm whales, said they're also waiting to see the direction Trump takes fisheries and ocean policy. They said they're hopeful progress made under Biden can withstand a second Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cIt would be extraordinarily short-sighted for the incoming administration to ignore the science and set off a fishing free-for-all that will only hurt fisheries \u2014 and healthy oceans \u2014 in the long run,\u201d said Jane Davenport, a senior attorney with Defenders of Wildlife.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:42:17 -0500",
    "summary": "&ldquo;The Bibi Files&rdquo; started with a sudden leak that turned into a deluge",
    "story": [
      "\u201cThe Bibi Files\u201d started with a sudden leak that turned into a deluge",
      "NEW YORK -- Veteran documentarian Alex Gibney, who in a decades-long career has tackled many a thorny issue, wasn't planning a film about Israel \u2014 until one day last year, when a stunning leak fell into his hands.",
      "The leak turned out to be more like a deluge.",
      "Suddenly, Gibney, through a source who contacted him on the Signal messaging app, was being offered access to copious video recordings of police interviews with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his wife Sara, his son Yair, and a host of associates and benefactors, all conducted as part of the sprawling corruption case against Netanyahu. It amounted to an astonishing 1,000-plus hours of tapes.",
      "The Oscar-winning filmmaker didn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but sensed this was something big. He turned to longtime Israeli investigative reporter Raviv Drucker, who did a deep dive into the material, Gibney says, and showed him that \u201cwe had something that was very explosive.\u201d Then Gibney enlisted colleague Alexis Bloom, who had worked in Israel, to direct.",
      "The result: \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d a hard-hitting documentary that certainly has timing on its side \u2014 this week, as it was released on streaming, Netanyahu took the stand in the long-running case.",
      "If the timing is fortuitous, the film faced other obstacles. For one thing, Gibney and Bloom had to raise funds without disclosing to potential backers what they had, given the secrecy involved. Many potential backers and distributors were also nervous about getting involved, especially once war broke out after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Then there was the biggest obstacle of all: The film cannot legally be shown in Israel, due to privacy laws regulating such proceedings.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Israelis aren\u2019t seeing it, though. Many have managed to watch the film either by using a VPN to bypass streaming restrictions, or by watching leaked versions that made their way to social media. \u201cThe film is being pirated like wildfire in Israel,\u201d says Bloom.",
      "And it has made a predictable splash, just as Netanyahu becomes the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. On Tuesday, he promised defiantly to knock down the \u201cabsurd\u201d corruption allegations against him.",
      "The longest-serving prime minister in Israel\u2019s history is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests, and of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage.",
      "In the leaked police videos, the 75-year-old leader sits at his desk in a surprisingly cramped office, a map of the region behind him. He expresses outrage at the proceedings, calls witnesses liars, and notes he has much weightier matters to attend to. At one point, asked about numbers of champagne bottles, he says he spends his time counting missiles threatening Israel, not bottles. Frequently, his answer is he doesn't remember.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of people on the record telling us what a great memory he has,\u201d says Gibney. \u201cAnd almost every question that could be possibly incriminating, he says \u2018I can\u2019t recall.\u2019\"",
      "Reviews in Israeli media for \u201cThe Bibi Files\u201d have mostly been positive, while noting that Netanyahu is portrayed in a harsh light. Not surprisingly, public reaction reflects longstanding divisions over the polarizing leader. He and his supporters say he\u2019s the subject of a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and biased justice system out to topple his rule.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s opponents will swear by the film and will only become more convinced that he is corrupt, dizzy with power and leading us to destruction,\u201d Nir Wolf, TV critic for the Netanyahu-friendly Israel Hayom paper, wrote. \u201cHis supporters will want to embrace him more.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has also noticed the film. In September, his lawyer asked the country\u2019s attorney general to investigate Drucker, who is a co-producer with Gibney, accusing him of trying to influence the legal proceedings. No investigation has been launched. (In the film, Drucker notes that Netanyahu has previously sued him three times.)",
      "The film, which intersperses police footage with commentary from former officials, Netanyahu associates, journalists and other analysts \u2014 including, frequently, Drucker \u2014 begins with the prime minister sitting for his first interview.",
      "\u201cWith Netanyahu, nothing concentrates his mind more than the sound of the prison gate slammed behind his back,\u201d comments Nimrod Novik, a former adviser to late Prime Minister Shimon Peres. One of Gibney and Bloom's key arguments will be that Netanyahu\u2019s fear of potential prison time has influenced his policy decisions \u2014 from judicial reform to war.",
      "Netanyahu appears indignant throughout. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me delusional questions,\u201d he tells his questioners. \u201cThis is preposterous and insane.\u201d",
      "In other footage, Arnon Milchan, the billionaire Hollywood mogul, Netanyahu friend and, more recently, prosecution witness, describes delivering fancy pink champagne on demand for Sara Netanyahu, sometimes toting a cooler himself, as part of an alleged gifts-for-favors scheme. Elsewhere, Sara Netanyahu sits for questioning herself. \u201cHow are you not ashamed of yourselves?\u201d she sharply admonishes the interviewers. She tells them that outside Israel, her husband is justly received as a king.",
      "Footage also includes interviews with Israeli-American billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. Sheldon Adelson expresses discomfort with the friendship \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll continue the relationship with them\" \u2014 and dismay over the cost of Netanyahu's preferred Cuban cigars: $1,100 for a box of 10.",
      "And a combative Yair Netanyahu, the couple\u2019s 33-year old son, tells his questioners: \u201cYou\u2019re investigating me because the Israeli police has become the Stasi secret police, wanting to overthrow the government.\u201d",
      "Director Bloom insists the film is not intended to preach to the choir \u2014 that it is made not for leftist opponents of Netanyahu, but for centrists.",
      "\u201cYou know, a hardcore Bibi-ist is probably going to remain a hardcore Bibi-est,\u201d the director says. \u201cBut there are a lot of centrists. \u2026 And it\u2019s very much a portrait of one family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anti-Israel, in the slightest.\u201d",
      "The filmmakers say they paused after the Oct. 7 attack, trying to figure out how to approach it. As part of the historical context in the film, they include chilling scenes of the raid on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhat was this going to mean?\u201d Gibney says they wondered. \u201cWith a bit of time, it became clear that this tale that we started before Oct. 7 remained a story of corruption \u2014 the size of the corruption kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\u201d",
      "The film, which began streaming Wednesday on the new service Jolt.film, draws a direct connection between Netanyahu's legal problems and the war. Through various commentators, it argues that the criminal cases led the prime minister to launch a campaign to weaken the country\u2019s judiciary, which in turn sparked mass protests and divisions that created an image of national weakness and led Hamas to attack. (Netanyahu rejects all such accusations).",
      "Bloom says she hopes people will, having watched \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d consider the idea that \u201cterm limits are a good idea.\" (Netanyahu has served a total of 17 years as prime minister.)",
      "And she also hopes they will take away a simple concept. \u201cIt's OK to criticize the prime minister of Israel, and it\u2019s not antisemitic and it\u2019s not anti-Israel,\u201d the director says. \"He\u2019s a political leader, like any other. \u201c",

      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials.

      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",

During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",

He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is offering his support for the dockworkers union before their contract expires next month at Eastern and Gulf Coast ports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday voiced his support for the dockworkers union before their contract expires next month at Eastern and Gulf Coast ports, saying that any further \u201cautomation\u201d of the ports would harm workers.",
      "The incoming president posted on social media that he met Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoreman's Association, and Dennis Daggett, the union's executive vice president.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen. Foreign companies have made a fortune in the U.S. by giving them access to our markets. They shouldn\u2019t be looking for every last penny knowing how many families are hurt.\u201d",

      "At the heart of the dispute is whether ports can install automated gates, cranes and container-moving trucks that could make it faster to unload and load ships. The union argues that automation would lead to fewer jobs, even though higher levels of productivity could do more to boost the salaries of remaining workers.",
      "The Maritime Alliance said in a statement that the contract goes beyond ports to \u201csupporting American consumers and giving American businesses access to the global marketplace \u2013 from farmers, to manufacturers, to small businesses, and innovative start-ups looking for new markets to sell their products.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo achieve this, we need modern technology that is proven to improve worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and strengthen our supply chains,\u201d said the alliance, adding that it looks forward to working with Trump.",
      "In October, the union representing 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for three days, raising the risk that a prolonged shutdown could push up inflation by making it difficult to unload container ships and export American products overseas.",
      "The issue pits an incoming president who won November's election on the promise of bringing down prices against commitments to support blue-collar workers along with the kinds of advanced technology that drew him support from Silicon Valley elite such as billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Trump sought to portray the dispute as being between U.S. workers and foreign companies, but advanced ports are also key for staying globally competitive. China is opening a $1.3 billion port in Peru that could accommodate ships too large for the Panama Canal.",
      "There is a risk that shippers could move to other ports, which could also lead to job losses. Mexico is constructing a port that is highly automated, while Dubai, Singapore and Rotterdam already have more advanced ports.",
      "Instead, Trump said that ports and shipping companies should eschew \u201cmachinery, which is expensive, and which will constantly have to be replaced.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cIt is time to put AMERICA FIRST!\u201d",

      "Dozens of environmental nonprofits issued a manifesto Thursday condemning new laws in Brazilian states that threaten to dismantle the Amazon soy moratorium",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Dozens of environmental nonprofits issued a manifesto Thursday condemning new laws in Brazilian states that threaten to dismantle the Amazon soy moratorium \u2014 a landmark voluntary agreement banning trade in soybeans from recently deforested areas.",
      "The 18-year-old moratorium stipulates that traders and oil producers refrain from buying soybeans grown on land cleared after 2008. The deal gathered strange bedfellows, ranging from environmental groups Greenpeace and WWF to U.S. commodity giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM.",
      "However, new laws recently enacted in the Amazon states of Mato Grosso, Brazil\u2019s largest soybean producer, and neighboring Rondonia have cut tax incentives for processing and trade companies that adhere to the agreement. Two other states and Brazil\u00b4s Congress are weighing similar legislation.",
      "\u201cThis means penalizing companies committed to ending deforestation, promoting the continued expansion of agribusiness in Amazon forest areas, creating subsidies for deforestation and discriminating against the granting of tax incentives based on companies\u2019 environmental commitment,\" Thursday's declaration stated.",
      "\"Therefore, those who are more ambitious in environmental protection lose the incentive,\u201d said the manifesto whose 67 signers include Greenpeace, WWF and Climate Observatory, a network of 119 organizations watching federal climate policy in Brazil.",
      "The document argues soybean production grew exponentially in the Amazon under the moratorium as it expanded into pasture land. Its area jumped from 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) in 2007 to 7.28 million hectares (18 million acres) in 2022, according to a moratorium report.",
      "The manifesto also calls for the companies that operate in Mato Grosso and Rondonia to maintain their commitment to the agreement even though it means losing millions of dollars in tax incentives \u2014 a tough decision for small and middle-sized companies.",
      "Researchers have found the moratorium is helping to preserve the Amazon forest. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil, between 2003 and 2016",
      "In a written response, the government of Mato Grosso said it enacted the law because the moratorium is harsher than Brazil\u00b4s legislation, which already has \u201cthe world\u2019s strictest environmental regulations.\u201d It also stated that most of the state is covered by original rainforest trees and plants.",
      "\u201cWe challenge these nonprofits to name any state, in any country, that is a major food producer and preserves 60% of its territory,\u201d the statement said.",

      "The popularity of drones has exploded in recent years, as small unmanned aircraft have become cheap enough for many hobbyists to buy",
      "Drones for commercial and recreational use have grown rapidly in popularity, despite restrictions on who can operate them and where they can be flown.",
      "No-fly zones are enforced around airports, military installations, nuclear plants, certain landmarks including the Statue of Liberty, and sports stadiums during games.",
      "Not everybody follows the rules. Sightings at airports have shut down flights in a few instances.",
      "Reported sightings of what appear to be drones flying over New Jersey at night in recent weeks have created anxiety among some residents, in part because it is not clear who is operating them or why. Some state and local officials have called for stricter rules to govern drones.",
      "After receiving reports of drone activity last month near Morris County, New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary bans on drone flights over a golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, that is owned by President-elect Donald Trump, and over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base. The FAA says the bans are in response to requests from \u201cfederal security partners.\u201d",
      "The FAA is responsible for the regulations governing their use, and Congress has written some requirements into law.",
      "With a 2018 law, the Preventing Emerging Threats Act, Congress gave certain agencies in the Homeland Security and Justice departments authority to counter threats from unmanned aircraft to protect the safety of certain facilities.",
      "New drones must be outfitted with equipment allowing law enforcement to identify the operator, and Congress gave the agencies the power to detect and take down unmanned aircraft that they consider dangerous.",
      "The law spells out where the counter-drone measures can be used, including \u201cnational special security events\u201d such as presidential inaugurations and other large gatherings of people.",
      "To get a \u201cremote pilot certificate,\u201d you must be at least 16 years old, be proficient in English, pass an aeronautics exam, and not suffer from a \u201dmental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system.\u201d",
      "Yes, but the FAA imposes restrictions on nighttime operations. Most drones are not allowed to fly at night unless they are equipped with anti-collision lights that are visible for at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).",
      "Over the past decade, pilots have reported hundreds of close calls between drones and airplanes including airline jets. In some cases, airplane pilots have had to take evasive action to avoid collisions.",
      "Drones buzzing over a runway caused flights to be stopped at London\u2019s Gatwick Airport during the Christmas travel rush in 2018 and again in May 2023. Police dismissed the idea of shooting down the drones, fearing that stray bullets could kill someone.",
      "Advances in drone technology have made it harder for law enforcement to find rogue drone operators \u2014 bigger drones in particular have more range and power.",
      "Some state and local officials in New Jersey are calling for stronger restrictions because of the recent sightings, and that has the drone industry worried.",
      "Scott Shtofman, director of government affairs at the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said putting more limits on drones could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on \u201ca growing economic engine for the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would definitely oppose anything that is blindly pushing for new regulation of what are right now legal drone operations,\u201d he said.",
      "AirSight, a company that sells software against \u201cdrone threats,\u201d says more than 20 states have enacted laws against privacy invasion by drones, including Peeping Toms.",
      "Will Austin, president of Warren County Community College in New Jersey, and founder of its drone program, says it's up to users to reduce public concern about the machines. He said operators must explain why they are flying when confronted by people worried about privacy or safety.",
      "\u201cIt's a brand new technology that's not really understood real well, so it will raise fear and anxiety in a lot of people,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe want to be good professional aviators and alleviate that.\u201d",

The outages also are blamed on a lack of maintenance and investment in its electric grid for decades.",

      "Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits doesn\u2019t give smaller stores access to discounts and rebates that larger chains receive, putting the smaller stores at a competitive disadvantage, the FTC alleged in the lawsuit it filed in California.",
      "\u201cWhen local businesses get squeezed because of unfair pricing practices that favor large chains, Americans see fewer choices and pay higher prices \u2014 and communities suffer,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.",
      "Miami-based Southern Glazer's called the lawsuit \u201cboth misguided and legally flawed.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlcohol distributors face numerous regulations that dictate how they compete and can price and discount products, and Southern Glazer\u2019s complies with those legal requirements,\u201d the company said. \u201cSouthern Glazer\u2019s strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations and will defend itself vigorously in this litigation.\u201d",
      "Southern Glazer\u2019s is one of the largest privately held companies in the U.S., with $26 billion in revenue from wine and spirits sales to retail customers in 2023, according to the FTC. It distributes one out of every three bottles of wine and spirits in the U.S. and serves commercial customers such as Total Wine, Costco and Kroger.",
      "The FTC's case is based on the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which permits volume discounts but only if a seller can demonstrate they achieve real cost efficiencies.",
      "According to the FTC, Southern Glazer\u2019s has repeatedly offered quantity discounts and rebates to large buyers that aren\u2019t justified by the difference in the costs of distributing products. In some cases, Southern Glazer's has charged significantly higher prices for sales of identical bottles of wine and spirits to independent retailers than to large chains that are only a few blocks away.",

      "The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said.",
      "Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges.",
      "Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects.",
      "Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this:",
      "North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those \u201cdomestic enablers,\u201d too.",
      "\u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program.",
      "In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government\u2019s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea\u2019s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy.",
      "In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans \u201cto obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.\u201d The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un \u201chas placed increased focus on education and training\u201d in IT-related subjects.",
      "In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation.",

His appointment marks only the fourth designer in Chanel\u2019s over 100-year history to lead the house, following Lagerfeld, Viard, and founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "Viard, who succeeded Lagerfeld after his death in 2019, left earlier this year after more than three decades with the brand \u2014 an abrupt departure, announced in the middle of the night just weeks before the couture show.",

Critics often cited her collections as lacking the theatrical flair of Lagerfeld\u2019s era, and backlash to a poorly received mid-season show in Marseille added pressure. Her appointment was initially viewed as temporary.",

The fifth-seeded Longhorns are the co-favorite at BetMGM with No. 1 and unbeaten Oregon at 7-2 odds; the other three are least 40-1, while Georgia is right behind Oregon and Texas as the next favorite.",
      "\u201cThese teams get hot and people just want to have a flyer on them,\u201d BetMGM trading manager Seamus Magee said. \u201cThey don't want to be standing there and not have a ticket on some of these long-shot teams.\u201d",
      "Expanding the playoff field from four to 12 teams this year meant more betting in general on college football and more varieties of wagering on the postseason. There were meaningful games played in the final month by not only Arizona State, Boise State and Indiana, but also SMU, Army and UNLV \u2014 a number of teams not always in the national title conversation.",
      "\u201cIt's one of the highest handles we've ever had on our national-championship market,\u201d Magee said. \u201cWe're in more states, for one, but the activity and the betting patterns we're seeing, it definitely feels a lot more than it has in years past.\u201d",
      "Magee said BetMGM has received action on both sides of the first-round game between 11th-seeded SMU and sixth-seeded Penn State, but the Mustangs have drawn notable action at DraftKings and Caesars Sportsbook.",
      "Money on SMU dropped Penn State from a 9-point favorite at DraftKings to 8 1/2.",
      "\u201cAny time they've played a real good team, they've had trouble,\" Johnny Avello, DraftKings race and sports operations director, said of the Nittany Lions. \"SMU shows that they're pretty good on both sides of the football and pretty resilient as a team. Always in the game. Always finds ways to fight back.\u201d",
      "Joey Feazel, who oversees football trading for Caesars, said much of the early betting in general was on underdogs.",
      "\u201cUsually, you see the dog money for these teams come late, especially on the sharps' (professional bettors) side,\u201d Feazel said.",
      "Boise State, which as the third seed has a first-round bye, will be the underdog in its quarterfinal matchup with Penn State or SMU.",
      "The Broncos got into the field as the highest-ranked Group of Five champion, but Avello said that doesn't mean they are one of the nation's top 12 teams (they are ranked No. 8 by AP and No. 9 by CFP). Avello said BYU, Colorado and Miami \u2014 none of which made the playoff \u2014 all would be favored over them.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of teams that aren't in the playoffs that would be favored,\" Avello said. \u201cThat's just not the way these playoffs work.\u201d",
      "Feazel said Boise State not being able to play at home on its blue carpet will be a notable disadvantage. Boise State's quarterfinal game will be at the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "\u201cIt will be all neutral,\" Feazel said. \"It's a big step up in class for Boise.\u201d",
      "Instead of all the games being played in climate-controlled domes or warm-weather locales \u2014 as has been in the case in past postseasons \u2014 three of the four first-round matchups will take place in the Northeast and Midwest.",
      "While that might not make a difference when Notre Dame hosts in-state foe Indiana, Ohio State will be at home against Tennessee and SMU visits Penn State.",
      "BetMGM favors all four home teams by more than a touchdown.",
      "\u201cYou have to take the weather into account for some of these games,\u201d Magee said. \u201cIt's going to be really cool to see a team like Tennessee that will have to go up to Columbus, where it can get really cold. SMU has to go from Dallas to Happy Valley. That's definitely going to be one of the coldest games a lot of those kids have played in their lives.\u201d",
      "SMU was the last team in the field, getting the benefit of the doubt over Alabama.",
      "The Mustangs had one fewer defeat than the three-loss Crimson Tide, who did not appear in the SEC title game. SMU lost on a 56-yard field goal to Clemson in the ACC championship.",
      "The sportsbook operators said the Tide would be favored by 5-10 points if they met SMU on a neutral field.",

      "The killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO in New York has prompted health care companies to rethink and increase security for executives",
      "\u201cWanted\u201d posters with the names and faces of health care executives have been popping up on the streets of New York. Hit lists with images of bullets are circulating online with warnings that industry leaders should be afraid.",
      "The apparent targeted killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and the menacing threats that followed have sent a shudder through corporate America and the health care industry in particular, leading to increased security for executives and some workers.",
      "In the week since the brazen shooting, health insurers have removed information about their top executives from company websites, canceled in-person meetings with shareholders and advised all employees to work from home temporarily.",
      "An internal New York Police Department bulletin warned this week that the online vitriol that followed the shooting could signal an immediate \u201celevated threat.\u201d",
      "Police fear that the Dec. 4 shooting could \"inspire a variety of extremists and grievance-driven malicious actors to violence,\" according to the bulletin, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWanted\u201d posters pasted to parking meters and construction site fences in Manhattan included photos of health care executives and the words \u201cDeny, defend, depose\u201d \u2014 similar to a phrase scrawled on bullets found near Thompson\u2019s body and echoing those used by insurance industry critics.",
      "Thompson's wife, Paulette, told NBC News last week that he told her some people had been threatening him and suggested the threats may have involved issues with insurance coverage.",
      "Investigators believe the shooting suspect, Luigi Mangione, may have been motivated by hostility toward health insurers. They are studying his writings about a previous back injury, and his disdain for corporate America and the U.S. health care system.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyer has cautioned against prejudging the case. Mangione, 26, has remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday. Manhattan prosecutors are working to bring him to New York to face a murder charge.",
      "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group, said this week it was working with law enforcement to ensure a safe work environment and to reinforce security guidelines and building access policies, a spokesperson said.",
      "The company has taken down photos, names and biographies for its top executives from its websites, a spokesperson said. Other organizations, including CVS, the parent company for insurance giant Aetna, have taken similar actions.",
      "Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. has announced that its investor day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned. Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said last week it was temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and would have its employees work from home.",
      "Heightened security measures likely will make health care companies and their leaders more inaccessible to their policyholders, said former Cigna executive Wendell Potter.",
      "\u201cAnd understandably so, with this act of violence. There\u2019s no assurance that this won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said Potter, who\u2019s now an advocate for health care reform.",
      "Private security firms and consultants have been in high demand, fielding calls almost immediately after the shooting from companies across a range of industries, including manufacturing and finance.",
      "Companies have long faced security risks and grappled with how far to take precautions for high-profile executives. But these recent threats sparked by Thompson's killing should not be ignored, said Dave Komendat, a former security chief for Boeing who now heads his own risk-management company.",
      "\u201cThe tone and tenor is different. The social reaction to this tragedy is different. And so I think that people need to take this seriously,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and top executives. Of those, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to just under $100,000.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Komendat was on a call with dozens of chief security officers from big corporations, and there have been many similar meetings since, hosted by security groups or law enforcement agencies assessing the threats, he said.",
      "\u201cIt just takes one person who is motivated by a poster \u2014 who may have experienced something in their life through one of these companies that was harmful,\" Komendat said.",

      "The first guest invited to ring the bell to open trading at the New York Stock Exchange in 1956 wasn\u2019t a company executive, a politician or a celebrity. It was a 10-year-old boy, Leonard Ross, who received the honor by winning a television quiz show.",
      "Since then, business titans, political giants and global film stars have all been among those ringing the opening bell at the NYSE. Ronald Reagan rang the bell as president in 1985. Billionaire businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Hollywood star Robert Downey Jr. have also rung the bell. The list even includes famous Muppets: Miss Piggy was once a bell ringer.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump joined that list Thursday when he opened trading at the famous stock exchange on Wall Street. He was accompanied by his wife, Melania, who interestingly enough received the honor before her husband. As first lady, she rang the bell in 2019 as part of her \u201cBe Best\u201d program.",
      "Bell-ringers are more commonly founders and executives chosen primarily from the exchange's more than 2,300 listed companies. Over the last few months, the guests have included executives from Alaska Air Group, Bath & Body Works, and Ally Financial.",
      "Stock trading around the location of the NYSE's current home has deep roots that trace back to the Dutch founding of New Amsterdam and when Wall Street had an actual wall. The NYSE traces its direct roots to the \u201cButtonwood Agreement\u201d signed in 1792, which set rules for stock trading and commissions.",
      "The NYSE moved into its first permanent home in 1865. The first bell in use was actually a gong. The exchange moved into its current iconic building in 1903 and started using an electronically operated brass bell. That has evolved into synchronized bells in each of the NYSE\u2019s four trading areas."

      "Up to $60,000 in reward money from the FBI and the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers program was offered for tips leading to a break in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- More than 400 tips were called into the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line during the five-day search for a masked gunman who ambushed and fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.",
      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect.",
      "Up to $60,000 in rewards from the FBI and the Crime Stoppers program had been offered to anyone calling in a tip leading to a break in the case. But although police and prosecutors moved quickly to arrest and charge 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, any rewards may take significantly more time to be released and might be less than the full amount after taxes and consideration of the role the tips played.",
      "Exactly who will get a reward or a share of one is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate with different rules, but both have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on the outcome of those tips.",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "For the NYPD Crime Stoppers award, funded by the New York City Police Foundation and the NYPD\u2019s Detective Bureau, the tip line usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. The Detective Bureau increased that amount to $10,000 in this case, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\u201cThe public\u2019s help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\u201d",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a number and usually a name. A tipster calling the Crime Stoppers line remains anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about the callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips, talk to detectives or other law enforcement involved in the investigation, and determine which tips served a substantial role in the case. The boards have some leeway to decide the amounts each tip would merit.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis.",
      "NYPD officials did not specify how any of the 30 tips helped the case, but it's unlikely each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money individual tipsters were awarded.",
      "For some programs such as the Rewards for Justice program, the FBI notes that it has awarded millions of dollars over the last two decades. For that program, the FBI sometimes announces the amount of the reward but does not identify the tipsters. Most often, the agency provides a confidential report to Congress detailing the tips and the rewards.",
      "The same principles apply to Crime Stoppers The program doesn't release details in an effort to protect the anonymity promised to tipsters. It does tout notable cases on its website in which the tips helped solve cases, including an April 2022 mass shooting on the where tips helped lead officials to the arrest and eventual guilty plea of Frank James.",

      "Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Wednesday at a news conference that the brothers used their wealth and influence to take advantage of victims during a period from at least 2010 to 2021. The Florida charges, meanwhile, involve specific incidents against known victims, according to prosecutors.",
      "The brothers, who all reside in the Miami area, used \u201cdeception, fraud, and coercion\u201d to entice victims to travel with them or attend parties or events in which they covered flights, hotels and other expenses, according to the New York indictment. They also at times used the promise of romantic relationships, officials said.",

      "\u201cWe don't believe he's a flight risk,\u201d Denaro said.",
      "U.S. prosecutors say the women who were victimized were often provided drugs, including cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms and GHB, and the brothers even surreptitiously drugged some of the women\u2019s drinks, leaving them physically impaired and unable to fight back or escape from the sexual assaults.",
      "In the Florida cases, state prosecutors described one incident in December 2016 as a \u201cgang rape\u201d of a woman who said she was invited to a barbecue at Alon Alexander\u2019s Miami Beach apartment only to discover no one there but Alon and another man.",
      "The second incident, in October 2017, involved a woman who said she was sexually assaulted by Oren Alexander at his apartment following a real estate event. The woman said she was given a glass of wine that made her feel weak and unable to control her body before the attack, according to prosecutors."

      "As in past years, YouTube was the single most popular platform teenagers used \u2014 90% said they watched videos on the site, down slightly from 95% in 2022. Nearly three-quarters said they visit YouTube every day.",
      "There was a slight downward trend in several popular apps teens used. For instance, 63% of teens said they used TikTok, down from 67% and Snapchat slipped to 55% from 59%. This small decline could be due to pandemic-era restrictions easing up and kids having more time to see friends in person, but it's not enough to be truly meaningful.",
      "X saw the biggest decline among teenage users. Only 17% of teenagers said they use X, down from 23% in 2022, the year Elon Musk bought the platform. Reddit held steady at 14%. About 6% of teenagers said they use Threads, Meta's answer to X that launched in 2023.",
      "The report comes as countries around the world are grappling with how to handle the effects of social media on young people's well-being. Australia recently passed a law banning kids under 16 from social networks, though it's unclear how it will be able to enforce the age limit \u2014 and whether it will come with unintended consequences such as isolating vulnerable kids from their peers.",
      "Meta's messaging service WhatsApp was a rare exception in that it saw the number of teenage users increase, to 23% from 17% in 2022.",
      "Pew also asked kids how often they use various online platforms. Small but significant numbers said they are on them \u201calmost constantly.\u201d For YouTube, 15% reported constant use, for TikTok, 16% and for Snapchat, 13%.",
      "As in previous surveys, girls were more likely to use TikTok almost constantly while boys gravitated to YouTube. There was no meaningful gender difference in the use of Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Roughly a quarter of Black and Hispanic teens said they visit TikTok almost constantly, compared with just 8% of white teenagers.",

      "Starmer was invited to the \u201cinformal\u201d Feb. 3 meeting in Brussels by European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa on Thursday, when the two officials met for talks at Starmer\u2019s office at 10 Downing St.",

      "Although he advocated remaining in the bloc during the 2016 Brexit referendum, Starmer has ruled out reversing the decision, or rejoining the EU\u2019s borderless single market and customs union, which would require the U.K. to accept many of the bloc\u2019s rules.",
      "He also has resisted pressure to agree to a youth mobility deal that would let young people from Britain and the EU live and work in the other\u2019s territory for a time. A Starmer spokesman said there were \u201cno plans\u201d for such an agreement."

      "GEORGETOWN, Ky. -- Toyota said Thursday it will build a new paint facility as part of a $922 million investment at its factory complex in Georgetown, Kentucky, making it the second big addition announced this year at the automaker's largest global manufacturing plant.",
      "In February, the company said it would invest $1.3 billion at its Kentucky complex, in part so it can build an all-new three-row electric SUV to be sold in the U.S.",
      "Neither project will add any new jobs at the facility, which now employs about 10,000 workers. However, the investments reinforce Toyota's commitment to long-term job stability, the company said.",
      "The new paint facility, scheduled to open in 2027, will add 1 million square feet of capacity while decreasing carbon emissions by 30% and water usage by 1.5 million gallons per year, Toyota said.",
      "It will enable the company to offer more diverse color options for its vehicles, the company said.",
      "\u201cToyota\u2019s commitment to advanced paint technologies goes beyond aesthetics,\u201d said Kerry Creech, president of Toyota Kentucky. \u201cIt encompasses efficiency, sustainability and quality, leading the industry in environmentally responsible manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The project also will increase flexibility for future vehicle production and advances Toyota's goal to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, the automaker said.",
      "Toyota\u2019s investment in the Bluegrass State has surpassed $11 billion since breaking ground at the central Kentucky site in 1986. Georgetown is 16 miles (26 kilometers) north of Lexington, Kentucky."

      "Deebo Samuel called for the ball more often this week on social media",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Deebo Samuel called for the ball more often this week on social media.",
      "When the ball came his way at a big spot in the game for San Francisco, Samuel ended up dropping it in a key play in a 12-6 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday night that just about doomed the playoff hopes for the 49ers.",
      "The play in question came midway through the third quarter with the game tied at 3 and the Niners driving for a go-ahead score. Brock Purdy targeted Samuel on a slant over the middle on third-and-10 and hit him right in the hands.",
      "But he dropped it instead, turning a potential touchdown into a field goal and leading to boos from the home crowd.",
      "\u201cI catch that ball, there\u2019s nothing there but the end zone,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I gotta catch that rock.\u201d",
      "Instead, it was part of another lackluster day for a player who has gone from an All-Pro in 2021 to an unproductive one this season. Samuel tried to explain why he has gained only 97 yards from scrimmage the previous four games when he posted: \u201cNot struggling at all just not getting the ball!!!!!!!\u201d",
      "Samuel later deleted the post, but not after it caused a bit of a social media firestorm and called it a matter of frustration.",
      "The Niners tried to get him involved early Thursday night with Purdy throwing to him on the first play only for it to get broken up. Samuel ended the night with three catches on seven targets for 16 yards and two rushes for 3 yards as he was held to less than 30 yards from scrimmage for a fifth straight game.",
      "But it was the play in the third quarter that stings the most.",
      "\u201cThat was a big one,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cThird down, and with Deebo\u2019s skillset, it was a shot and we didn\u2019t score on the play. Deebo clearly needs to catch that ball.\u201d",
      "It was that type of game for the 49ers, who were held to their fewest yards (191) in a regular- season game in eight seasons under Shanahan and the fewest points since scoring three in Shanahan's debut in 2017.",
      "\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI thought we played good enough to win obviously on defense and special teams. But we didn\u2019t get enough done on offense.\u201d",
      "There was plenty of blame to spread around. Both offenses struggled during heavy rain in the first half when there was a heavy downpour but the 49ers weren't any better when the conditions improved after halftime.",
      "After settling for a field goal on their first drive of the third quarter, the 49ers stalled. Purdy couldn't connect on a deep shot to Samuel on the next drive that ended with a punt.",
      "Then after falling behind 9-6, Purdy missed an open Ricky Pearsall on a deep throw with the Niners in Rams territory. Two plays later, his deep shot to Jauan Jennings was intercepted by Darious Williams in the end zone.",
      "\u201cLooking back on it, second-and-11, just be smart, try to check the ball down when I can\u2019t see where he is at,\u201d Purdy said. \"So, just got to learn from it.\u201d",
      "It was a rough night overall for Purdy, who was held to less than 160 yards passing for the third time in four games. He went 14 for 31 for 142 yards with the interception and failed to lead a single TD drive.",
      "The Niners lost a game when they didn't allow a TD for the first time since 2007 and are all but eliminated from playoff contention.",
      "\u201cI just feel like I had a lot of plays left out there that I could have made for our team,\u201d Purdy said. \"I thought the defense and special teams played so good. And that\u2019s what\u2019s hurting me is I just feel like I failed the team. I could have been better for our offense and we could have put up more points",

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Four nights after winning the highest-scoring game of the NFL season, the Los Angeles Rams won the only game this year that didn't have a touchdown.",
      "Joshua Karty kicked four field goals and the Rams survived a slugfest a week after winning a shootout, beating the San Francisco 49ers 12-6 on Thursday night in a key game in the NFC West race.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s really cool is this team has found a bunch of different ways to be able to win football games,\" coach Sean McVay said. \u201cYou come off a 44-42 game the other day and then you win 12-6. Our group did what they needed to do to be able to get it done.\u201d",
      "The Rams (8-6) followed up the high-scoring win over Buffalo by winning for the seventh time in nine games following a 1-4 start. The Rams moved within a half-game of division-leading Seattle. Los Angeles won a game without a touchdown for the first time since 2016.",

      "\u201cIt was the story of the year,\u201d linebacker Fred Warner said. \u201cJust not doing enough to win games. Not playing complementary. Just coming out a little too short.\u201d",
      "Karty capped a 17-play drive with a game-tying 23-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter and then hit a 27-yarder after Matthew Stafford connected on a 51-yard pass to Puka Nacua.",

      "Stafford then led a clock-killing drive that was capped by Karty's fourth field goal with 18 seconds to play. Stafford went 16 for 27 for 160 yards, with 137 of those yards coming after halftime when the heavy rain stopped.",
      "\u201cIn the second half, the weather was good enough to do it all,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cWe had the feeling that that was the kind of way this game was going to be played and it\u2019s going to have to be one of those games. We scored 44 four nights ago and come out here and score 12 but they both count for one.\u201d",

      "The first half was played in a downpour and it had a major impact on the offensive performances with neither team able to move the ball.",
      "The Rams had no first downs on their first four drives for the first time since 2013 before getting a late field goal to tie the game. The Niners went three-and-out three times and got one field goal.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Scientists suspect the first complete specimen ever recorded of the world\u2019s rarest whale died from head injuries, an expert said Friday.",
      "The first dissection of a spade-toothed whale, a type of beaked whale, was completed last week after a painstaking examination at a research center near the New Zealand city of Dunedin, the local people who led the scientific team, Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou, said in a statement issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.",
      "A near-perfectly preserved 5-meter (16-foot) male was found washed up on a South Island beach in July. It was the first complete specimen ever recorded. There have only been seven known sightings and never of a living spade-toothed whale.",
      "New Zealand conservation agency beaked whale expert Anton van Helden said the whale\u2019s broken jaw and bruising to the head and neck led scientists to believe that head trauma may have caused its death.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, but we suspect there must have been some sort of trauma, but what caused that could be anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d van Helden said in a statement.",
      "All varieties of beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers didn\u2019t know how the spade-toothed type processed its food.",
      "The scientific team found the specimen had nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, the statement said.",
      "Among the more interesting finds were tiny vestigial teeth in the upper jaw.",
      "\u201cThese little teeth embedded in the gum tells us something about their evolutionary history. It\u2019s remarkable to see this and it\u2019s just another thing that we had no idea about,\u201d van Helden said.",

      "The dissection was also notable because scientists and curators worked together with local M\u0101ori people to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and customs into each step of the process.",
      "Following the dissection, the local iwi, or tribe, will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts retained by the iwi.",

And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages.",
      "Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement.",

      "Meanwhile, bitcoin's value has rocketed to all-time highs after the U.S. election was clinched by Donald Trump. It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining \u2014 sucking away huge amounts of power \u2014 has played a part in the outages in Iran.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, some opportunistic and exploitative individuals use subsidized electricity, public networks and other resources for cryptocurrency mining without authorization,\" Mostafa Rajabi, the CEO of Iran's government-owned power company, said back in August.",
      "Iran\u2019s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities. Then in October and November, rolling power cuts across Tehran's neighborhoods became the norm in daylight hours.",
      "Climate change has been blamed in part, with persisting droughts and less water running through Iranian hydroelectric dams.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered several power plants to stop burning mazut, a high-polluting heavy fuel common in the former Soviet Union countries. Tehran has used it in the past to make up the difference in electricity generation.",
      "Fuel reserves, both in diesel and natural gas, also remain low even though Iran is an OPEC member and home to one of the world's second-largest reserves of natural gas, behind only Russia. There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls.",
      "For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must \"honestly tell the public about the energy situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no choice but to consume energy economically, especially gas, in the current conditions and the cold weather,\u201d he said in mid-November. \u201cI myself use warm clothes at home; others can do the same.\"",
      "Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran \u2014 raising questions where the power is going.",
      "In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power.",
      "And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool.",
      "Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer.",
      "Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. \u201cThey distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,\" Alavi said.",
      "In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally.",
      "Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms.",
      "The farms have caused \u201can abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,\u201d Rajabi said.",
      "The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province \u2014 one of the country's chief manufacturing sites.",
      "Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran. A voice off camera asks how it was possible the electrical company did not discover the farm sooner.",
      "The U.S. Treasury and Israel have targeted bitcoin wallets that they\u2019ve alleged are affiliated with operations run by Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to finance allied militant groups in Mideast war zones.",
      "That suggests the Guard itself \u2014 one of the most-powerful forces within Iran \u2014 may be involved in the mining.",

      "Iran may see bitcoin as a hedge against increased pressure from the incoming Trump administration and as regional allies are engulfed in turmoil, said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "\"The question for the economists inside Iran is do we trust this enough to fund the government,\" said Nephew, who has long worked on Iran issues and sanction strategies in the U.S. government.",
      "However, he cautioned against thinking of bitcoin as a magic bullet for Iran, particularly as bitcoin wallets can be targeted in sanctions.",

      "Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within 5 days, is unprecedented.",
      "The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 2 meters (6.5 feet) that weighed 120 kilograms and 131 kilograms (264 pounds and 288 pounds), respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent, like in the next few years, risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,\u201d said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project.",
      "Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species.",
      "\u201cThis information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,\u201d said Hogan.",
      "The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region\u2019s cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually.",
      "Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them.",
      "\"Their cooperation is essential for our research and conservation efforts,\u201d Heng Kong, director of Cambodia\u2019s Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, said in a statement.",
      "Apart from the Mekong giant catfish, the river is also home to other large fish including the salmon carp, which was thought to be extinct until it was spotted earlier this year, and the giant sting ray.",
      "That four of these fish were caught and tagged in a single day is likely the \u201cbig fish story of the century for the Mekong\u201d, said Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center\u2019s Southeast Asia Program. He said that seeing them confirms that the annual fish migration was still robust despite all the pressures facing the environment along the Mekong.",
      "\u201cHopefully what happened this week will show the Mekong countries and the world that the Mekong\u2019s mighty fish population is uniquely special and needs to be conserved,\u201d he said.",

Residents of the area known as Starbase submitted the petition, according to the company.",
      "The area is on the southern tip of Texas at Boca Chica Beach, near the Mexican border. Earlier this year, Musk announced he was moving the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media company X from California to Texas.",
      "\u201cTo continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community. That is why we are requesting that Cameron County call an election to enable the incorporation of Starbase as the newest city in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d Kathryn Lueders, the general manager of Starbase, wrote in a letter to the county.",
      "It's not the first time turning Starbase into its own city has been floated. Musk proposed the idea in 2021 when he wrote a social media post that simply said, \u201cCreating the city of Starbase, Texas.\u201d",
      "Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevi\u00f1o Jr., the county\u2019s top elected official, said despite the talks of incorporation in 2021, this was the first time a petition was officially filed.",

      "SpaceX's rapid expansion in the region has drawn pushback from some locals. Earlier this year, a group called Save RGV sued the company in July over allegations of environmental violations and dumping polluted water into the nearby bay.

      "The popularity of drones has exploded in recent years, as small unmanned aircraft have become cheap enough for many hobbyists to buy",
      "Drones for commercial and recreational use have grown rapidly in popularity, despite restrictions on who can operate them and where they can be flown.",
      "No-fly zones are enforced around airports, military installations, nuclear plants, certain landmarks including the Statue of Liberty, and sports stadiums during games.",
      "Not everybody follows the rules. Sightings at airports have shut down flights in a few instances.",
      "Reported sightings of what appear to be drones flying over New Jersey at night in recent weeks have created anxiety among some residents, in part because it is not clear who is operating them or why. Some state and local officials have called for stricter rules to govern drones.",
      "After receiving reports of drone activity last month near Morris County, New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary bans on drone flights over a golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, that is owned by President-elect Donald Trump, and over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base. The FAA says the bans are in response to requests from \u201cfederal security partners.\u201d",
      "The FAA is responsible for the regulations governing their use, and Congress has written some requirements into law.",
      "With a 2018 law, the Preventing Emerging Threats Act, Congress gave certain agencies in the Homeland Security and Justice departments authority to counter threats from unmanned aircraft to protect the safety of certain facilities.",
      "New drones must be outfitted with equipment allowing law enforcement to identify the operator, and Congress gave the agencies the power to detect and take down unmanned aircraft that they consider dangerous.",
      "The law spells out where the counter-drone measures can be used, including \u201cnational special security events\u201d such as presidential inaugurations and other large gatherings of people.",
      "To get a \u201cremote pilot certificate,\u201d you must be at least 16 years old, be proficient in English, pass an aeronautics exam, and not suffer from a \u201dmental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system.\u201d",
      "Yes, but the FAA imposes restrictions on nighttime operations. Most drones are not allowed to fly at night unless they are equipped with anti-collision lights that are visible for at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).",
      "Over the past decade, pilots have reported hundreds of close calls between drones and airplanes including airline jets. In some cases, airplane pilots have had to take evasive action to avoid collisions.",
      "Drones buzzing over a runway caused flights to be stopped at London\u2019s Gatwick Airport during the Christmas travel rush in 2018 and again in May 2023. Police dismissed the idea of shooting down the drones, fearing that stray bullets could kill someone.",
      "Advances in drone technology have made it harder for law enforcement to find rogue drone operators \u2014 bigger drones in particular have more range and power.",
      "Some state and local officials in New Jersey are calling for stronger restrictions because of the recent sightings, and that has the drone industry worried.",
      "Scott Shtofman, director of government affairs at the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said putting more limits on drones could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on \u201ca growing economic engine for the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would definitely oppose anything that is blindly pushing for new regulation of what are right now legal drone operations,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt's a brand new technology that's not really understood real well, so it will raise fear and anxiety in a lot of people,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe want to be good professional aviators and alleviate that.\u201d",

The new $82.99 a month price tag will go into effect starting Jan. 13 for existing subscribers, and immediately for new customers who sign up going forward.",

      "Google's video giant also directed customers to an online FAQ for more information. Those who currently pay discounted prices, for example, won't see the change until their trial or promotional has elapsed.",
      "YouTube TV has rolled out a series of price hikes over the years. When launched back in 2017, the going price of its streaming package was $35 a month. By 2019, that fee rose to $50 \u2014 and has climbed higher and higher since. The last time YouTube TV raised its base price, then to $72.99, was in March 2023.",
      "Earlier increases arrived as YouTube TV added more and more channels for subscribers to stream live. But licensing disputes have also added pressures \u2014 and YouTube has instead attributed its more recent hikes, like those announced both Thursday and last year, to rising operational costs.",
      "YouTube TV currently advertises more than 100 channels from broadcast, cable and regional sports networks, a DVR with unlimited storage and up to six accounts per household with three concurrent streams. And the platform says its latest price increase won't change any of that.",
      "While YouTube TV's live offerings are much different than individual online libraries seen from other popular streamers today, it\u2019s no secret that streaming is getting more expensive overall \u2014 particularly as consumers juggle multiple subscriptions to access all the content they want. In recent years, big names like Netflix, Apple TV+ and Disney+ have all either hikes their prices or added things like ad-supported tiers and password limits.",
      "And more and more streamers have also tapped into bundles to get in on the live action. YouTube TV's new $82.99 price is the same as that advertised for Disney\u2019s Hulu + Live TV bundle.",

LOUIS -- Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies \u2014 workers who then funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missiles and other weapons, the head of the FBI office in St. Louis said Thursday.",
      "The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said.",
      "Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges.",
      "Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects.",
      "Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this:",
      "North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those \u201cdomestic enablers,\u201d too.",
      "\u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program.",
      "In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government\u2019s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea\u2019s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy.",
      "In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans \u201cto obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.\u201d The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un \u201chas placed increased focus on education and training\u201d in IT-related subjects.",
      "In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation.",
      "Johnson urged companies to thoroughly vet IT workers hired to work remotely. \u201cOne of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote,\u201d she said.",
      "Officials didn\u2019t name the companies that unknowingly hired North Korean workers."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Neanderthals and humans likely mixed and mingled during a narrow time frame 45,000 years ago, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Researchers analyzed ancient genes to pinpoint the time period, which is slightly more recent than previous estimates for the mating.",
      "Modern humans emerged in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago and eventually spread to Europe, Asia and beyond. Somewhere along the way, they met and mated with Neanderthals, leaving a lasting fingerprint on our genetic code.",

They also examined bone fragments from an early human population in Ranis, Germany, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) away. They found snippets of Neanderthal DNA that placed the mating at around 45,000 years ago.",
      "In a separate study, researchers tracked signs of Neanderthal in our genetic code over 50,000 years. They found Neanderthal genes related to immunity and metabolism that may have helped early humans survive and thrive outside of Africa.",

      "There was a slight downward trend in several popular apps teens used. For instance, 63% of teens said they used TikTok, down from 67% and Snapchat slipped to 55% from 59%. This small decline could be due to pandemic-era restrictions easing up and kids having more time to see friends in person, but it's not enough to be truly meaningful.",

      "The report comes as countries around the world are grappling with how to handle the effects of social media on young people's well-being. Australia recently passed a law banning kids under 16 from social networks, though it's unclear how it will be able to enforce the age limit \u2014 and whether it will come with unintended consequences such as isolating vulnerable kids from their peers.",

      "A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why",
      "TOMS River, N.J. -- A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don\u2019t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.",
      "The FBI is among several agencies investigating, and it has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.",
      "Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey starting in November.",
      "At first, the drones were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, a waterway that feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state's largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.",
      "But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.",
      "U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Coast Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.",
      "Gov. Murphy has said the aircraft do not pose a threat, but has not provided any details to support this.",
      "Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.",
      "Officials and experts say some witnesses may actually be seeing planes or helicopters rather than drones, or perhaps are confused about the size of the devices they're seeing.",
      "\u201cThere are certainly big drones, such as a agricultural drones, but typically they are not the type you see flying around in urban or suburban spaces,\u201d John Duesler, president of the Pennsylvania Drone Association, said Thursday. The organization with about 350 members, is headquartered in Pittston, Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cI wonder a little bit if it\u2019s sort of a type of fish story, as in \u2018I caught a fish this big!\u2019 type of a thing,\u201d Deusler added. \u201cAt night, it\u2019s hard to see how big the drones are, especially because they can be either closer or further away from you. To get that perspective of how big they are is really difficult.\u201d",
      "Authorities say they do not know who is behind the drones.",
      "The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don\u2019t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.",
      "Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those fears.",
      "Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, Smith and U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones, citing safety concerns.",
      "The Pentagon insists the drones do not represent a threat from abroad.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military\u2019s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council \u2014 that the drones are not of foreign origin \u2014 remains unchanged.",
      "Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.",
      "The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in New Jersey, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.",
      "Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Sightings also have been reported in neighboring New York and Pennsylvania.",
      "Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.",

      "The global chemical weapons watchdog has opened an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country\u2019s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The global chemical weapons watchdog opened an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country\u2019s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad.",
      "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Monday told Syria that it is under obligations to comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas, after rebels entered the capital, Damascus, over the weekend.",
      "\u201cChemical weapons have been used in Syria on multiple occasions and victims deserve that perpetrators that we identified be brought to justice and held accountable for what they did and that investigations continue,\u201d Fernando Arias Gonz\u00e1lez, the OPCW secretary general, said in his opening remarks.",
      "\u201cOur reports over the past few years have reached very clear conclusions and we hope that the new circumstances in Syria will allow this chapter to be closed soon,\u201d he added, referring to the lack of stockpile declarations and the use of the weapons themselves.",
      "Assad\u2019s government has denied using chemical weapons but the OPCW found evidence indicating their repeated use by Syria in the grinding civil war. Earlier this year, the organization found the Islamic State group had used mustard gas against the town of Marea.",
      "In a rare move, the OPCW's executive council called the meeting, hoping that under a new government, some of its 80 inspectors may be allowed to pursue investigations into Syria's chemical weapons program.",
      "Members of the ousted Syrian government plan to gradually transfer power to a new transitional Cabinet headed by Mohammed al-Bashir, who reportedly headed the rebel alliance\u2019s \u201csalvation government\u201d in its southwest Syrian stronghold.",
      "Arias Gonz\u00e1lez also expressed concern about ongoing Israeli airstrikes in Syria.",
      "\u201cWe do not know yet whether these strikes have affected chemical weapons related sites. Such airstrikes could create a risk of contamination. Another real risk would be the destruction of valuable evidence for investigations by different independent international bodies related to past use of chemical weapons,\u201d the Spanish diplomat said.",
      "The last time the OPCW called an extraordinary meeting was in 2018, in response to the chemical attack on Douma, a town close to Damascus, when some 40 people were killed by poison gas. Last year the watchdog found that the Syrian Armed Forces dropped canisters of chlorine gas during a major military operation.",
      "Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus.",
      "The OPCW\u2019s 193 member states are required to disclose their chemical weapons programs and dismantle them. The organization, created in 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention, seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons. In 2013, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work."

      "Amazon is planning to donate $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration fund",
      "NEW YORK -- Amazon is planning to donate $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration fund, a move that comes as major tech companies seek to improve their relationship with the incoming president.",
      "A company spokesperson confirmed Thursday evening that the e-commerce giant will also stream Trump's inauguration on its Prime Video service, a separate in-kind donation worth another $1 million.",
      "Earlier in the day, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund.",
      "Amazon's plans were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The report came after Trump said Thursday morning that the company's founder, Jeff Bezos, was planning to visit him in person next week.",
      "The two men had feuded in the past. During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.",
      "Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump's past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times' DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect's plans to cut regulations.",
      "In October, Bezos did not allow the Post to endorse a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and to protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper. At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper that editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don\u2019t believe the media.",
      "Separately, the donation from Meta, which was also first reported by the Journal, came just weeks after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the offering Thursday.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been appointed deputy chief of staff for Trump\u2019s second term, has said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, wants to support Trump\u2019s economic plans. The tech CEO has been seeking to change his company\u2019s perception on the right following a rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The company restored his account in early 2023.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but he has voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt.",
      "Still, Trump had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly during the campaign. In July, he posted a message on his own Truth Social platform threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \u201cZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Corporations have traditionally made up a large share of donors to presidential inaugurals, with an exception in 2009, when then-President-elect Barack Obama refused to accept corporate donations. He reversed course for his second inaugural in 2013.",
      "Facebook did not donate to either Biden's 2021 inaugural or Trump\u2019s 2017 inaugural.",
      "Google donated $285,000 each to Trump's first inaugural and Biden\u2019s inaugural, according to Federal Election Commission records. Inaugural committees are required to disclose the source of their fundraising, but not how they spend the money. Microsoft gave $1 million to Obama\u2019s second inaugural, but only $500,000 to Trump in 2017 and Biden in 2021.",
      "Amazon had donated roughly $58,000 to Trump's 2017 inaugural, much lower than than $1 million it now plans to donate. The company also streamed Biden's inauguration on Prime Video in 2021."

      "DoorDash is requiring its drivers to verify their identities more often as part of a larger effort to crack down on unauthorized account sharing",
      "DoorDash will require its drivers to verify their identities more often as part of a larger effort to crack down on unauthorized account sharing.",
      "DoorDash has been under pressure to ensure its drivers are operating legally. Over the summer, for example, it pledged to do a better job identifying and removing dangerous drivers after a flood of complaints of dangerous driving from cities.",
      "Officials in Boston, New York and other cities have said that in many cases, people with multiple traffic violations continue to make deliveries using accounts registered to others.",
      "The San Francisco delivery company said Thursday it was requiring some drivers to complete real-time identity checks immediately after they complete a delivery. Previously, drivers were occasionally asked to re-verify their identities before or after a shift.",
      "DoorDash has introduced the new system in Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle and other cities, and said it planned a wider rollout next year.",
      "DoorDash said it also has developed an advanced machine learning system that can flag potential unauthorized account access, including login anomalies and suspicious activity. If the company detects a problem, it will require drivers to re-verify their identity before they can make more deliveries.",
      "U.S. drivers must verify their identities with a driver\u2019s license or other government-issued identification, and upload a selfie that matches their identification photo before they can do work for DoorDash. They also must submit to background checks, which require a Social Security number.",
      "The company said it found that some drivers were getting around the requirements by sharing accounts with authorized users. In some cases, drivers who were not authorized to drive for DoorDash paid authorized users for access to their accounts.",
      "Some federal lawmakers have demanded that DoorDash and other delivery apps do a better job of keeping people who are in the U.S. illegally off the platforms.",
      "Republican U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana and Ted Budd of North Carolina sent letters to delivery companies in April asking them to crack down on account sharing.",
      "\u201cThese illegal immigrants are delivering food directly to consumers\u2019 doors without ever having undergone a background check and often without even using their real names,\u201d the letter said. It added that working illegally can also be dangerous for migrants, creating the potential for exploitation and abuse.",
      "The Associated Press left messages seeking comment Thursday with Gig Workers Rising and Justice for App Workers, which both represent delivery drivers.",
      "DoorDash won\u2019t estimate how many drivers are using shared accounts, but said its safeguards are effective. Last year, it began asking drivers to re-verify their identities monthly by submitting a selfie. The company said it is now asking more than 150,000 drivers to complete selfie checks each week, and it\u2019s removing them from the platform if they don\u2019t comply."

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration has announced it is raising tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses",
      "BANGKOK -- The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses.",
      "The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.",
      "The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions.",
      "\u201cThe tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People\u2019s Republic of China,\" USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. \"These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.\u201d",
      "Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry took aim Thursday at the approval by the House of Representatives of a defense spending bill that includes $3 billion in funding for removal from U.S. networks of telecoms equipment provided by Chinese firms, including Huawei and ZTE.",
      "\u201cThe United States\u2019 claim that Chinese information and communication products pose security risks is completely baseless,\" ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters at a routine briefing. \"We hope that the U.S. will respect facts and stop politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade issues. China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises,\u201d He said without elaborating.",
      "Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S.",
      "China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world.",
      "Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before.",
      "After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back.",
      "Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake.",
      "His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach.",
      "China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.",
      "China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks.",
      "In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases.",
      "The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others.",
      "It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%."

      "Cyber officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications after a sprawling hacking campaign",
      "LONDON -- After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications.",
      "To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies \u2014 such as Verizon and AT&T \u2014 that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: \u201cEnsure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.\u201d",
      "End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key.",
      "Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over.",
      "Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption:",
      "Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims.",
      "If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages.",
      "The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on.",
      "But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards.",
      "Apple has noted that RCS messages \u201caren\u2019t end-to-end encrypted, which means they\u2019re not protected from a third party reading them while they\u2019re sent between devices.\u201d",
      "Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, \u201cEncryption only available for Android to Android communication.\u201d",
      "To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps.",
      "Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it \u201cfor security and correctness.\u201d",
      "Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms.",
      "Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast \u201cchannels\" but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn\u2019t work with group chats.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in \u2018secret chat\u2019 feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France.",
      "Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages.",
      "There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted.",
      "The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed.",
      "WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season with a free software update that includes a feature that enables users to create customized emojis within a matter of seconds.",
      "The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery. Other features include an \u201cImage Playground\u201d for a variety of AI-styled illustrations, writing tools and options for summarizing emails.",
      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",
      "Apple is broadening the AI suite's appeal by including English versions tailored for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. that are included in the latest software update.",
      "Although the iPhone's AI is similar to many of the features that have already been available from other companies, Apple is taking a slightly different approach to the technology in an effort to stand out from the rest of pack. It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple."

Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches.",
      "In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will \u201cunderstand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.\u201d It's a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software.",
      "A lot of Google's latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube.",
      "Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone's \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d features that spruced up the device's Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday.",
      "Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case.",
      "Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered \u201canswer engines\u201d such as Perplexity.",
      "After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year.",
      "The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed \u201cProject Astra,\u201d with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group's size.",
      "As part of Gemini 2.0, Google is also going to begin testing an extension to Chrome called \u201cProject Mariner,\u201d which can be turned on to do online searches and sift through the results so people don't won't have to bother.",
      "If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation. Google has ridiculed the Justice Department's proposal as \u201coverly broad\u201d and vowed to resist any attempt to break up the company during federal court hearings scheduled to begin in Washington D.C. next spring.",
      "Even if those proceedings culminate in a court order mandating a breakup, Google could still appeal in a process that could take years to resolve while it continues its AI expansion.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what this next era brings,\u201d Pichai wrote in his blog post, signaling the company doesn't believe it will be deterred by regulators."

      "The Geminids \u2014 among the few major meteor showers to come from asteroids \u2014 peak on Friday. It's one of the year's last chances to see fireballs in the sky.",
      "The shower often produces meteors with a distinctly more yellow glow, likely due to the unusual origin material, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Bell Museum.",
      "Under ideal viewing conditions, the Geminids typically put on one of the best and brightest shows of the year because of the high volume of meteors visible each hour. However, an almost full moon this year means up to 15 meteors per hour are expected at peak time, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The moonlight \u201cwill wash out a lot of them,\" Brummel said.",
      "Viewing lasts until Dec. 21. Here\u2019s what to know about the Geminids and other meteor showers.",
      "Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.",
      "Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets, but a few \u2014 including the Geminids \u2014 result from the debris of asteroids. The Geminids come from the sun-orbiting asteroid 3200 Phaethon.",
      "When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d",
      "The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.",
      "The rocky nature of asteroid debris makes the Geminids especially likely to produce fireballs, said NASA's William Cooke. \u201cThose are pretty tough rocks that can penetrate deep into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.",
      "Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.",
      "It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.",
      "And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren\u2019t checking your phone.",
      "The next meteor shower, the Ursids, will peak on Dec. 22.",

      "TikTok has challenged a Canadian government order to shut down the Chinese video-sharing app's business operations in the country that was imposed over national security concerns.",
      "The company said Tuesday that it filed an application for a judicial review with the Federal Court in Vancouver on Dec. 5, which seeks to set aside the order for TikTok to wind-up and cease its business in Canada.",
      "The Canadian federal government last month announced it was ordering the dissolution of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. after a national security review of its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd.",
      "The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver.",
      "The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow.",
      "TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne's decision was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and \u201cdriven by improper purposes.\u201d It says the order is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and the the national security review was \u201cprocedurally unfair.\u201d",
      "The review was carried out through the Investment Canada Act, which allows the government to investigate foreign investment with potential to harm national security.",
      "Champagne said in a statement at the time that the government was taking action to address \u201cspecific national security risks,\u201d but did not elaborate. His office said in response to the filling that the government\u2019s decision was informed by a \u201cthorough national security review and advice from Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community.\u201d",

      "The platform says there were \u201cless onerous\u201d options than shutting down its Canadian business, which it said would eliminate hundreds of jobs, threaten business contracts and \u201ccause the destruction of significant economic opportunities.\""

    "story": [
      "Lawyers in the Alex Jones bankruptcy case are now in discussions on what could happen next after a federal judge in Texas rejected the auction sale of Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
      "The Onion's rejected purchase of Infowars in an auction bid supported by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting dealt them a new setback Wednesday and clouded the future of Alex Jones' conspiracy theory platform, which will remain in his control for at least the near future.",
      "What's next for Infowars and the Sandy Hook families' long-sought efforts to hold Jones accountable over calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax was unclear, after a federal judge in Houston late Tuesday rejected The Onion's winning bid for the site. The only other bidder was a company aligned with Jones.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston said he did not want another auction but offered no roadmap over how to proceed. One possibility includes ultimately allowing Sandy Hook families \u2014 who comprise most of Jones' creditors \u2014 to return to state courts in Connecticut and Texas to collect on the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation and emotional distress lawsuit judgments that Jones was ordered to pay them.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that when this process ends, and it will end, and it will end sooner rather than later, is that all assets that Alex Jones has available are paid to the families, and that includes Infowars, and that as a result of that process Alex Jones is deprived of the ownership and control of the platform that he\u2019s used to hurt so many people,\u201d Christopher Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families, said Wednesday.",
      "The families, meanwhile, were preparing to mark the 12th anniversary of the Dec. 14 shooting.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay the $1.5 billion. Jones was sued for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 massacre of 20 first graders and six educators was staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "He has since conceded that the shooting did happen.",
      "Lopez said there was a lack of transparency in the bidding process and too much confusion about The Onion's bid, and he expressed concern that the amount of money offered was too low.",
      "The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, submitted a $1.75 million cash offer with plans to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody. The bid also included a deal with many of the Sandy Hook families for them to forgo $750,000 of their auction proceeds and give it to other creditors.",
      "The other bidder was First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and planned to let Jones stay on the Infowars platforms. It offered $3.5 million in cash and later, with Jones, alleged fraud and collusion in the bidding process. Lopez rejected those allegations.",
      "Christopher Murray, the trustee who oversaw the auction, said he picked The Onion and its deal with the Sandy Hook families because it would have provided more money to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Lopez directed Murray to come up with a new plan to move forward. Murray and representatives of The Onion did not immediately return messages seeking comment.",
      "The judge said there was a possibility there could be a trial in 2025 to settle Jones' bankruptcy and that Murray could try to sell the equity in Infowars' parent company.",
      "The judge said he wanted to hear back from Murray and others involved in the bankruptcy within 30 days on a plan.",
      "On the social media platform X, Jones called the judge's ruling a \u201cMajor Victory For Freedom Of The Press & Due Process.\"",
      "Jeff Anapolsky, an adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law Center and the managing director and founder of Anapolsky Advisors, a financial consulting firm, said he was not surprised Lopez rejected the sale. He was not involved in the case but said he has appeared before Lopez and described him as a fair judge.",
      "Anapolsky believes the sale of the Infowars assets will ultimately take place and be approved.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s up to Mr. Murray now, the trustee, to go do something to make everybody feel like everybody had their say and understand the transparency of the process,\u201d Anapolsky said.",
      "The decision came during a solemn week for relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The 12th anniversary is Saturday, and some of the victims' relatives were traveling to Washington, D.C., to attend an annual vigil for victims of gun violence. The families usually mark the anniversary out of the public eye.",
      "Many of the families have said their lawsuits against Jones bought back the unbearable pain of losing their loved ones, as well as the trauma of being harassed and threatened by believers of Jones' hoax conspiracy. Relatives said they have been confronted in public by hoax believers and received death and rape threats.",
      "The families have not received any money from Jones since winning the trials.",

      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop is installing kiosks in all of its stores in the Northeast U.S. to make digital-only coupons more accessible",
      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop said Wednesday that it would install kiosks in all of its U.S. stores to make digital-only coupons more accessible to customers.",
      "Stop & Shop, which operates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, said the kiosks will let customers scan a loyalty card or enter a phone number and quickly get access to any digital coupons or personalized offers.",
      "The kiosks, known as Savings Stations, are expected to be installed in all 365 Stop & Shop locations by early January, the company said.",
      "Digital-only deals are advertised online or on store shelves. They can offer significant savings but generally require customers to electronically clip a coupon located in a grocer\u2019s app or on its website.",
      "In 2022, a coalition of consumer groups sent letters to a dozen supermarket chains, including Kroger and Stop & Shop, urging them to make sure deals are available in both digital and non-digital formats.",
      "The groups, which included Consumer Reports, Consumer Action, the Public Interest Research Group and the National Consumers League, said many shoppers may lack smartphones, internet access or the technical savvy to figure out how digital-only coupons work.",
      "Smartphone access varies widely by age group in the U.S., according to a 2021 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. The study found that 96% of people ages 18 to 29 own a smartphone, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. The same study found that 25% of people 65 or older don\u2019t use the internet.",
      "Consumer World founder Edgar Dworsky said Wednesday that Stop & Shop was the first chain to respond to the group\u2019s request. Dworsky said the kiosks would help customers who have been shut out of deals previously. But he also thinks they will help regular app users, since they give shoppers access to all of a store\u2019s deals at once.",
      "Stop & Shop said it started piloting the Savings Station late last year. The kiosk give shoppers a printout of the digital coupons loaded onto their loyalty cards if they want to reference them while shopping.",
      "Stop & Shop President Roger Wheeler said the chain was hearing from customers who felt they were missing out on deals.",
      "\u201cIt ensures that our customers can easily access all of our great deals, especially during the holiday season when savings are top of mind,\u201d Wheeler said in a statement."

      "DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.",
      "Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "GM bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016 with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.",
      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",
      "The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise\u2019s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call Tuesday the the new unit will focus on personal vehicles and developing systems that can drive by themselves in certain circumstances.",
      "The company has agreements to buy another 7% of Cruise and intends to buy the remaining shares so it owns the whole company.",
      "The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.",
      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "GM said it will work with Cruise\u2019s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise\u2019s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.",
      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",
      "\u201cWe want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,\u201d Barra said.",

      "Back in 2022, Epic agreed to pay a total of $520 million to settle complaints revolving around children\u2019s privacy and payment methods on its popular Fortnite game. The FTC alleged the video game giant used deceptive online design tactics to trick Fortnite players, including children, into making unintended purchases \u201cbased on the press of a single button.\"",

    "summary": "A watchdog probe has uncovered no evidence that FBI agents were involved in inciting the Jan. 6 attack, undercutting years of baseless claims by far-right figures.",
    "story": [
      "The findings undercut baseless claims that the FBI played a significant role.",
      "An independent watchdog probe uncovered no evidence that federal agents were involved in inciting the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to a report released Thursday, undercutting years of baseless claims spread by far-right political figures who have alleged the FBI played a significant role in the attack.",
      "The long-awaited report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found no evidence that FBI undercover employees were present among the thousands of Trump supporters who stormed the building, or even among the crowds of Trump's supporters who attended protests around Washington, D.C. that day.",
      "While the report confirmed there were 26 informants in Washington, D.C., who were dubbed within the FBI as \"confidential human sources\" or CHSs, Horowitz uncovered no evidence suggesting that any were instructed to join the assault on the Capitol or otherwise encourage illegal activity by members of the pro-Trump mob.",
      "Moreover, the IG's report found that three of the confidential informants were specifically tasked by FBI field offices with reporting on suspects in specific domestic terrorism cases who were believed to be attending events on Jan. 6, and one of those entered the Capitol during the riot itself.",
      "Twenty-three others were in Washington but were not found to have been instructed to be there by any FBI field offices, and of those 23, three entered the Capitol while 11 entered the restricted areas around the building, the probe found.",
      "The report found that none of the four informants who entered the Capitol have been prosecuted to date by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.",
      "In a statement responding to the report's findings, the U.S. Attorney's Office said they have generally \"not charged those individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals; and we have treated the CHSs consistent with this approach.\"",
      "While the FBI has faced serious scrutiny over the past four years over whether they failed to properly prepare for Congress' election certification and the possibility of an attack on the Capitol by Trump's supporters, Horowitz's report determined that the bureau \"took significant and appropriate steps in advance of January 6\" as part of its supporting role that day.",
      "The report also found that the FBI did not properly canvass all the field offices for intelligence on potential activity prior to the attack.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate described the lack of a canvass prior to Jan. as a \"basic step that was missed,\" and told the inspector general's office that he would have expected a formal canvassing of sources to have occurred.",
      "The inspector general found that while the FBI did not intentionally mislead Congress about the lack of canvassing field offices, they were not accurate in their assessment.",
      "In June of 2023, Senate Democrats released a report that directly faulted the FBI for failing to \"sound the alarm and share critical intelligence information that could have helped law enforcement better prepare for the events of January 6th.\"",
      "The report detailed a series of tips and other online traffic in advance of Jan. 6 that the lawmakers said the FBI was aware of that gave clear indications Trump's supporters were planning for violence to prevent the certification of President Biden's 2020 victory.",
      "In the leadup to Jan. 6, the FBI did not have any \"potentially critical intelligence\" in their possession that wasn't provided to other law enforcement entities, the IG said in the new report released Thursday.",
      "More than 1,500 people across nearly all 50 states have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, with crimes ranging from illegal trespassing on Capitol grounds, to assaults on federal officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Court proceedings over the past three years, including in the seditious conspiracy trial against members of the far-right Proud Boys group, have shed light on some FBI informants who were either monitoring or among those in the crowd of Trump's supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. Right wing media and some far-right political figures have seized on the presence of confidential human sources to push the conspiracy theory that the FBI or 'deep state' was involved in fomenting the crowd to violence -- claims that even many attorneys for Jan. 6 defendants have rejected as false.",
      "\"Our review determined that none of these FBI CHSs was authorized by the FBI to enter the Capitol or a restricted area or to otherwise break the law on January 6, nor was any CHS directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6,\" Horowitz said in a statement announcing his report.",

      "His comments come days before he holds confirmation meetings with GOP senators.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said Thursday he believes anti-obesity drugs \"have a place.\"",
      "The comment, given in a brief interview to CNBC off the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, was the strongest suggestion yet that, if confirmed to take over the Department Health and Human Services, Kennedy wouldn't necessarily move to block access to a class of drugs that he's sharply criticized in the past but that doctors are hailing as a powerful tool in the obesity epidemic.",
      "When asked how he felt by drugs that mimic the actions of the GLP-1 hormone, Kennedy said \"the first line of response should be lifestyle, it should be eating well, making sure that you don't get obese, and that those GLP drugs have a place.\"",
      "Kennedy's aside comes one day after Trump adviser Elon Musk said he believes \"nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public.\"",
      "The seeming endorsement of medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound from two people who have Trump's ear is likely to be a relief for the pharmaceutical industry following Kennedy's sharp questioning of America's reliance on weight-loss medications. Previously, Kennedy has said that if America paid more for quality food, it would solve the obesity crisis \"overnight\" -- a statement obesity experts criticized as overly simplistic.",
      "Still in question is how the incoming administration plans to handle coverage of the drugs through Medicare and Medicaid and any regulation of the private insurance industry.",
      "The Biden administration has called for Medicare and Medicaid to expand coverage of weight-loss drugs for people struggling with obesity, not just as a treatment for diabetes. But because that rule won't kick in until 2026, it'll be up to the incoming administration to enact.",
      "Covering GLP-1 drugs under federal health insurance programs would come at a significant cost to the country. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that expanding coverage of anti-obesity drugs in Medicare alone would increase federal spending by about $35 billion from 2026 to 2034.",
      "Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy, has criticized the Biden proposal's embrace of weight-loss drugs instead of pushing lifestyle changes and suggested that the incoming administration should work on \"benefit flexibility where patients can work with their doctors on the best solution to reverse obesity for them,\" including \"lifestyle coaching, food interventions, or, in some cases, drugs.\"",
      "Means also said the government should ensure the price mirrors European costs.",
      "\"The problem isn't that Ozempic exists,\" Means tweeted on Thursday. \"It is the fact that this Danish company has been able to pay US regulators, media, and lawmakers to force this drug down our throats as the only option.\"",
      "In the CNBC interview on Thursday, Kennedy also reiterated his stance that he doesn't oppose all vaccines.",
      "While Kennedy has said he's not opposed to all vaccines, he has falsely claimed that childhood vaccines cause autism, despite the retraction of the fraudulent study that originally suggested this link, and numerous subsequent high-quality studies disproving this theory.",
      "In a Time magazine interview, Trump said the issue of vaccine safety still warrants a \"big discussion\" and that he would be open to restricting some vaccines if Kennedy found them \"dangerous.\"",
      "Kennedy has said he is \"fully vaccinated,\" except against COVID-19.",

      "Nevada's attorney general has revived the state's 2020 fake electors case",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A slate of six Nevada Republicans have again been charged with submitting a bogus certificate to Congress that declared Donald Trump the winner of the presidential battleground's 2020 election.",
      "Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford announced Thursday that the state's fake electors case had been revived in Carson City, the capital, where he filed a new complaint this week charging the defendants with \u201cuttering a forged instrument,\u201d a felony. The original indictment was dismissed earlier this year after a state judge ruled that Clark County, the state\u2019s most populous county and home to Las Vegas, was the wrong venue for the case.",
      "Ford, a Democrat, said the new case was filed as a precaution to avoid the statute of limitations expiring while the Nevada Supreme Court weighs his appeal of the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cWhile we disagree with the finding of improper venue and will continue to seek to overturn it, we are preserving our legal rights in order to ensure that these fake electors do not escape justice,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThe actions the fake electors undertook in 2020 violated Nevada criminal law and were direct attempts to both sow doubt in our democracy and undermine the results of a free and fair election. Justice requires that these actions not go unpunished.\u201d",
      "Officials have said it was part of a larger scheme across seven battleground states to keep Trump in the White House after losing to Democrat Joe Biden. Criminal cases have also been brought in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona.",
      "Trump lost in 2020 to Biden by more than 30,000 votes in Nevada. An investigation by then-Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.",
      "The defendants are state GOP chair Michael McDonald; Clark County GOP chair Jesse Law; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; Storey County clerk Jim Hindle; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area.",
      "In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, McDonald's attorney, Richard Wright, called the new complaint a political move by a Democratic state attorney general who also announced Thursday he plans to run for governor in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe will withhold further comment and address the issues in court,\u201d said Wright, who has spoken often in court on behalf of all six defendants.",
      "Attorneys for the others did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Their lawyers previously argued that Ford improperly brought the case before a grand jury in Democratic-leaning Las Vegas instead of in a northern Nevada city, where the alleged crimes occurred.",

      "The DNC\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee will lay out procedural guidelines for the simmering race to lead the campaigning and fundraising arm of the national party that is embroiled in self-reflection and a touch of finger-pointing at the vulnerabilities and pitfalls of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019 bids for the White House and who exactly should shoulder the blame.",
      "Some details expected to be hashed out Thursday include when four candidate forums, effectively mini-debates, will occur, and if any of them will be moderated on live television, as well as voting and balloting procedures. Executing this election will be one of the final acts of the current RBC, chaired by Minyon Moore and Jim Roosevelt Jr., as a new party chair could shake up membership.",
      "And candidates have just eight weeks to lay out their case to the body\u2019s 448 members, who are set to elect their new leader on Feb. 1.",
      "The field, currently composed of five men -- four white and one Latino -- could become even more crowded in the new year. But for now, the declared candidates are: Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party; former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley; New York state Sen. James Skoufis; and Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler. And former Department of Homeland Security staffer Nate Snyder announced his bid on Wednesday.",
      "To qualify for the upcoming forums, these candidates need a minimum of 40 members to support their bid via petition.",
      "Many of the candidates are expected to be at Thursday's meeting.",
      "Akin to running for public office -- or possibly school council -- candidates hire a staff, launch their own websites, hand out swag, and begin to work the phones behind the scenes to land the nearly 230 votes needed to win. Martin\u2019s crew, for example, is nicknamed KNOT -- Ken\u2019s National Organizing Team.",
      "Perhaps the most familiar name to DNC members is Martin, who serves as vice-chair of the organization alongside his DFL role. He\u2019s also a sitting member of the RBC, with long ties to state and local party-building. Martin\u2019s campaign confirmed to ABC News that he has over 100 endorsements from DNC members.",
      "Wikler, another Midwesterner, also has significant name ID, and is a popular pick across the spectrum of the party, endorsed by centrist group Third Way and farther-left like MoveOn and Bold Progressive in the same day. Wikler also joined Jon Stewart on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d earlier this week.",
      "\u201cBen is an unstoppable uniter, organizer, and messenger who knows how to win tough elections,\u201d Brianna Johnson, spokesperson for Ben Wikler for DNC Chair, told ABC News. \u201cSince he became Chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party -- in a 50-50 state --Democrats in Wisconsin have won 7 of the past 10 statewide races, raised more money than any other state party over the same time period, and have taken back power in a state once rigged by Republicans.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Malley and Skoufis have appeared on cable news outlets to boost their bids as well, pitching themselves as not beholden to the Washington donor class.",
      "Internally, Martin\u2019s network seems to be working to his advantage, said a DNC member with close knowledge of the candidates who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the process.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s working the phones with multiple calls to undecided DNC members, and has a strong surrogate campaign to do the same thing. His network as ASDC Chair seems to be working to his advantage, although it looks like he might have hit a wall with endorsements,\u201d the DNC member said.",
      "In contrast, that same member says they and a handful of other members they\u2019ve spoken to have yet to hear from O\u2019Malley by phone -- just by email.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from anyone who he\u2019s talked to, in contrast with the Martin and Wikler campaigns that are actively whipping votes,\u201d the DNC member said.",
      "An O\u2019Malley aide told ABC News that the former Maryland governor recently resigned from his post as commissioner of the Social Security Administration to seek the DNC role, and his team is working around the clock to reach all 447 members.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are looking for an operational leader and in this contest that\u2019s Martin O\u2019Malley,\u201d the aide said. \u201cHe\u2019s running as a change-maker not a caretaker with a record as mayor, governor, and commissioner of bringing people together to deliver success.\u201d the aide said.",
      "A dark horse candidate could also shake up dynamics as well, leaving the possibility for a wide-open race. The DNC executive committee will meet Friday, though little news is expected from that smaller gathering.",

The update came amid several back-to-back appointments to his administration on Wednesday night, all of which he shared through his Truth Social account.",
      "In his post congratulating Lake, Trump said, \"Kari was a beloved News Anchor in Arizona, which supported me by record margins, for over 20 years.\"",
      "Trump also indicated that he will soon announce a leader for the U.S. Agency of Global Media.

      "She left the GOP for eight years to register as an Independent, and then a Democrat, before returning to her political career as a Republican, where she found success with policies aligning with the Make America Great Again crowd.",
      "She was a vocal backer of Trump's \"big lie\" about election fraud in 2021 -- and she used that narrative to fuel her own campaign for governor in 2022. She also refused to concede the loss of her own gubernatorial race and attempted, unsuccessfully, to overturn the results.",
      "Trump also said he will nominate Michael Rigas to the State Department as deputy secretary of state for management and resources.",
      "Rigas served in the last Trump administration in several capacities, including as the both the deputy and acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, and as an acting deputy director at the Office of Management and Budget.",

      "In his congratulatory note on Truth Social, Trump boasted of Newlin's law enforcement career, writing, \"Dan boasts an impressive 28-year career with the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Orlando, Florida. Throughout his tenure, Newlin rapidly advanced working in major crimes as a fugitive detective. Dan demonstrated exceptional investigative skills, successfully taking hundreds of violent offenders off the streets, including those involved in armed robbery, gang violence, human trafficking, and illegal gun and narcotics trafficking.\"",
      "He also lauded Newlin for founding an injury law practice and went on to say, \"With his Law Enforcement expertise enabling him to navigate complex international issues, and his business insights fostering economic partnerships, Newlin stands as a powerful advocate for U.S. interests, and a Champion for strengthening ties, and making a difference in the World.\"",
      "He also announced Lamelas as his pick for ambassador to Argentina, posting, \"Peter is a physician, philanthropist, and an incredible businessman, best known for founding the largest Urgent Care healthcare company in Florida.\"",
      "The post continued, \"As a child, Peter and his family fled communist Cuba, and LEGALLY immigrated to the USA, starting with nothing, and achieving the American Dream.\"",
      "Trump then announced Rizzuto as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States, citing his professional achievements and saying the Conair co-founder would be \"fantastic.\"",

      "Elon Musk, who has been tapped to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, vocalized his support for weight loss drugs on Wednesday.",
      "\"Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making [GLP-1 drugs] super low cost to the public. Nothing else is even close,\" Musk wrote in his post on X.",
      "Some of the most prominent GLP-1 drugs, also known as drugs used for weight loss, include Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound.",
      "The post comes as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- whom Trump nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services -- has openly espoused negative viewpoints about people using medication to treat obesity.",
      "RFK Jr. had previously told Fox News that weight loss drug makers are \"counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs.\"",
      "\"If we just gave good food, three meals a day, to every man, woman and child in our country, we could solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight,\" he added.",
      "However, in a televised interview from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, directly following Musk's endorsement of GLP-1 drugs, RFK Jr. offered a slightly different slant on his former comments, stating that the weight-loss drugs might \"have a place\" after all.",
      "\"The first line of response should be lifestyle, it should be eating well, making sure that you don't get obese, and that those GLP drugs have a place,\" he said.",
      "As head of the HHS, RFK Jr. will oversee agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which manages health coverage for millions of Americans, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, which is in charge of approving new drugs or expanding uses of existing drugs, given they are found safe and effective.",
      "Trump has since picked Dr. Mehmet Oz to work under RFK Jr. as head of the CMS. Oz has spoken favorably about anti-obesity drugs in the past. It is yet to be seen how this potential difference of opinion might play out between the two Trump appointees.",
      "Last month, the CMS under President Joe Biden proposed a new rule to expand access to these medications by classifying them as treatment for disease rather than simply for weight loss.",
      "Currently, Medicare is not allowed to cover medications used for weight loss alone.",
      "They do cover GLP-1 drugs that are FDA-approved for Type 2 diabetes \u2013 if the patient has diabetes.",
      "Wegovy is covered for obesity if the patient also already has cardiovascular disease.",
      "Individual states may opt to cover these drugs under Medicaid -- but many do not.",
      "Musk's post was written in response to an ongoing discourse about the health care industry in the United States, sparked by this month's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "At the time of his arrest, the shooting suspect reportedly had with him writings that criticized companies in the nation's health care industry for being the most expensive in the world, despite the U.S. ranking lower than many other developed nations in terms of life expectancy, according to law enforcement.",
      "Multiple clinical trials are also underway to determine what other diseases GLP-1 drugs may potentially protect against. The drugs are currently approved for Type 2 diabetes, weight loss and heart disease.",
      "Studies have shown that alongside weight loss and Type 2 diabetes management, the drugs may protect against high blood pressure, liver disease, kidney disease and other health complications of obesity.",
      "Research has also shown that the drugs may reduce the risk of cognitive decline, like dementia.",
      "There have also previously been anecdotal reports that the drugs may assist in reducing addictive behavior including substance abuse, alcohol use or gambling, which researchers continue to investigate.",

      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, Bill Clinton campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris, serving as a key surrogate sent to rural areas and to speak with working-class voters.",
      "Asked how Democrats can win back working-class voters who have been shifting to support Republicans, Clinton said that he feels part of the challenge is \"cultural,\" as rural voters skewer more conservative and are dealing with things they are not used to.",
      "\"The world moves on, and things that once made sense to people don't anymore,\" he said. \"The world moves on, and things that once made sense to people don't anymore. Things that should make sense don't anymore.\"",
      "\"We need to quit screaming at each other and listen to each other. We need to have a serious conversation about these things. And I think one of the things that Democrats sometimes do is give up on too many people, because the demographics say they're not going to be for it,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"Well, that may be, but you know, if you don't deal with something that's controversial, just because you don't want to hear it, that's like an insult to voters.\"",
      "Clinton has devoted time to charitable and health causes since his presidency, and his memoir \"Citizen: My Life After the White House\" released in November.",

      "Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx has reached her final hours as the conference's leader on education policy.",
      "For 20 years, Foxx has served on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. For the last two terms while Republicans were in the majority in the House, she's held the coveted position of chairwoman and was ranking member when Democrats were in control from 2019 until 2021. In fact, the 81-year-old congresswoman was granted a waiver to lead the committee for the 118th Congress because Republicans limit their top committee position to six years.",
      "The Republican Steering Committee will elect the next chair on Thursday.",
      "Foxx told ABC News that her top priority this session was reducing college costs through reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.",
      "Many of the K-12 topics on the former college instructor and community college president's legislative agenda became winning issues for Republicans. Parents' rights, protecting women and girls in sports, and school choice policies -- issues that reached the national stage on the campaign trail this year -- were widely supported by Republicans under Foxx's leadership.",
      "Foxx is known for foiling the Biden administration's signature higher education policies, including his student loan forgiveness program. She's been called a \"hero\" by staffers and a \"force of nature\" by House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "\"She has been a very faithful friend to me and a good model for all of us,\" Johnson recalled in an interview with ABC News. \"Her work ethic is incredible. She is so passionate about what she does. She is a force of nature, but she also has a way to balance it with humility,\" Johnson said.",
      "Foxx's dedication to education was exhibited by her committee's crackdown on alleged antisemitism engulfing college campuses over the last year. She spearheaded the collecting of more than 400,000 pages of documents, historic subpoenas for documents and internal communications, and hearings that led to the resignations of Ivy League presidents who failed to protect Jewish students at U.S. universities, according to the committee's wide-reaching report.",
      "\"Our goal was and is to make sure that Jewish students are safe on campus,\" Foxx told ABC News, adding, \"All students should be safe on campus, but it was the Jewish students who were being threatened and harassed and, at times, assaulted.\"",
      "House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik has worked alongside Foxx for the last decade on the committee. Stefanik credits Foxx with being the driving force pushing education to the top of the House's agenda as Johnson took up the antisemitism issue earlier this spring.",
      "\"The great thing about Virginia is she's not going to slow down, and I think she will have other great chapters in Congress, but it's been great to be on the committee with her, and I'm very proud of her, and she is someone that so many people look up to,\" Stefanik told ABC News.",
      "Foxx's work ethic can be traced back to her humble beginning in Avery County, North Carolina, in Appalachia. She told ABC News that she grew up very poor.",
      "\"I just never imagined, in my wildest dreams, being in Congress or having a portrait,\" Foxx said when asked this fall about the painting of her that now hangs in the Education Committee's hearing room on Capitol Hill. \"I grew up in a town with no electricity and no running water.\"",
      "Foxx is now a mentor to her colleagues, including Stefanik and Utah's Burgess Owens.",
      "\"She's a bulldog when it comes down to what she wants to get accomplished and that's what we've needed to actually bring education to the forefront,\" Rep. Owens told ABC News.",
      "A former NFL player, Owens said he admires Foxx's ability to build a team and compared the chairwoman to his legendary head coach Al Davis.",
      "\"I see what Dr. Foxx is doing with education in the same way,\" Owens said. \"I think for the first time, education is becoming a priority, not only for those of us who have a passion for it, but for Americans across the country who just took it for granted,\" he said.",
      "A relative newcomer to the committee, Owens wants to follow in Foxx's footsteps. He is challenging Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Michigan, to succeed Foxx as chair.",
      "Owens told ABC News he's feeling anxious about winning over his colleagues on the committee. Meanwhile, Walberg and Rep. G.T. Thompson of Pennsylvania are the second-longest serving Republicans on the committee behind Foxx. After 16 years, Walberg said he believes he deserves the top position.",
      "Foxx said she has loved chairing the committee, but it's just one of many highlights during her time on the Hill.",

      "Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi \u2014 which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time.",
      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",
      "\u201cPeople want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,\" she added.",
      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "A West Point graduate and former U.S. Army infantry officer, Seymour joined America West Airlines in 1999. America West became US Airways, then merged with American in 2013. Seymour has held a variety of operations-related jobs and was promoted to his current post in 2020.",
      "Seymour spoke with The Associated Press recently about managing huge passenger numbers during the holidays and preventing people from getting on a plane before their boarding group is called. The answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: There are many thousands of people running the airline every day. My job, honestly, over this period isn\u2019t so much about managing the chaos, it's managing really all the challenges, and we'll call it the headwinds that come our way. And I would say the vast majority of those are the uncontrollable.",
      "A: What\u2019s going on the (air-traffic control) system around us. If there weren't weather that we have to deal with and other complications that sometimes arise, running an airline would be pretty easy.",
      "A: Before the pandemic, we would have a big storm in the DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) area or the Charlotte (North Carolina) area, and it would take us a couple of days (to recover). We set about coming through the pandemic and coming out that we are going to recover better than any carrier out there.",
      "A: By anticipating the weather. My team looks out constantly at what the weather is, looking at multiple weather forecasts to understand what\u2019s coming, what could it do, and how are we prepared for that.",
      "A: The team here, they do an after-action review. We will look at it and say, \u2018What could we have done better?\u2019 And we archive that information. Now, to your other question about competitors. I\u2019m not inside the other competitors' operations centers and looking at how they do that. Their networks are set up differently than ours. We do ask ourselves, \u2018OK, if something similar were to happen to us, what would we do?\u2019",
      "A: Weather is always a tough thing to predict. That\u2019s really going to be one of the largest things because it has the potential for having the most impact. Controller-wise, we stay in touch with (the Federal Aviation Administration). We have a team out here that is in constant communication with the FAA, looking at what\u2019s happening in the system, and we\u2019re building contingency plans if they think there are going to be some challenges.",
      "A: The only difference between summer and now is we have to deal with winter weather in some locations. So, deicing. But we\u2019re ready for that. The technology we have right now with the deicing vehicles ... we\u2019ve been able to reduce our throughput time on deicing by half and still meeting all the requirements that we need to in terms of adequately deicing the aircraft, but having one person do it.",
      "A: No. Boeing needs to be successful, they need to be able to deliver quality aircraft, but we haven't built our schedule for the holiday period that is dependent on getting any deliveries. We have enough buffer built in.",
      "A: Our frequent and premium travelers look at (the technology to catch line-jumpers) as a benefit of being loyal to American Airlines. It's a huge plus for our gate agents because they do like order.",
      "A: No. We just want a steady stream (of passengers) going in. The ability to get overhead bin space ... has gotten a lot better with some of the upgrades that we\u2019ve done with larger overhead bins on the vast majority of our aircraft. We're going to finish up the rest of the fleet in the next couple years with the large overhead bins. So that won\u2019t be the issue, but that used to be a bit of that driver there."

      "It was the largest suicide-murder in recent history, and a government-backed tour operator wants to open the former commune now shrouded by lush vegetation to visitors, a proposal that is reopening old wounds, with critics saying it would disrespect victims and dig up a sordid past.",
      "Jordan Vilchez, who grew up in California and was moved into the Peoples Temple commune at age 14, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the U.S. that she has mixed feelings about the tour.",
      "She was in Guyana\u2019s capital the day Jones ordered hundreds of his followers to drink a poisoned grape-flavored drink that was given to children first. Her two sisters and two nephews were among the victims.",
      "\u201cI just missed dying by one day,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Vilchez, 67, said Guyana has every right to profit from any plans related to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cThen on the other hand, I just feel like any situation where people were manipulated into their deaths should be treated with respect,\u201d she said.",
      "Vilchez added that she hopes the tour operator would provide context and explain why so many people went to Guyana trusting they would find a better life.",
      "The tour would ferry visitors to the far-flung village of Port Kaituma nestled in the lush jungles of northern Guyana. It\u2019s a trip available only by boat, helicopter or plane; rivers instead of roads connect Guyana\u2019s interior. Once there, it\u2019s another six miles via a rough and overgrown dirt trail to the abandoned commune and former agricultural settlement.",
      "Neville Bissember, a law professor at the University of Guyana, questioned the proposed tour, calling it a \u201cghoulish and bizarre\u201d idea in a recently published letter.",
      "\u201cWhat part of Guyana\u2019s nature and culture is represented in a place where death by mass suicide and other atrocities and human rights violations were perpetuated against a submissive group of American citizens, which had nothing to do with Guyana nor Guyanese?\u201d he wrote.",
      "Despite ongoing criticism, the tour has strong support from the government's Tourism Authority and Guyana\u2019s Tourism and Hospitality Association.",
      "Tourism Minister Oneidge Walrond told the AP the government is backing the effort at Jonestown but is aware \u201cof some level of push back\u201d from certain sectors of society.",
      "She said the government already has helped clear the area \u201cto ensure a better product can be marketed,\u201d adding that the tour might need Cabinet approval.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has my support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible. After all, we have seen what Rwanda has done with that awful tragedy as an example.\u201d",
      "Rose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.",
      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",
      "Paul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.",
      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",
      "Those in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.",
      "\u201cThe area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,\" he said. \u201cWe should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.\u201d",
      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the prurient interest in tragedy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,\u201d she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 03:22:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is likely to bring big changes to seafood, one of the oldest sectors of the U.S. economy",
    "story": [
      "The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is likely to bring big changes to seafood, one of the oldest sectors of the U.S. economy",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is likely to bring big changes for one of the oldest sectors of the U.S. economy \u2014 seafood \u2014 and some in the industry believe the returning president will be more responsive to its needs.",
      "Economic analysts paint a more complicated picture, as they fear Trump\u2019s pending trade hostilities with major trading partners Canada and China could make an already pricy kind of protein more expensive to consumers. Conservationists also fear Trump's emphasis on government deregulation could jeopardize fish stocks that are already in peril.",
      "But many in the commercial fishing and seafood processing industries said they are excited for Trump\u2019s second presidency. They said they expect he\u2019ll allow fishing in protected areas as he did in his first presidency, crack down on offshore wind expansion and cut back regulations they describe as burdensome. And they expect a marked shift from the administration of President Joe Biden, who prioritized ocean conservation and championed wind power from the start.",
      "The seafood industry isn't hungry for another tariff war, which hurt fishermen during Trump's first term, said Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association. But she said the new Trump administration has a unique chance to throw its support behind U.S. fishermen.",
      "\u201cI think we should be focused on feeding Americans,\u201d Casoni said. \u201cThe \u2018America First\u2019 administration I think will make that point loud and clear. Know where your food is coming from.\u201d",
      "But the seafood industry, which is international in nature, could be seriously disrupted if Trump goes through with a plan to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada, said John Sackton, a longtime industry analyst and founder of Seafood News. Canada is the largest seafood market for the U.S. for both imports and exports, and nearly a sixth of the seafood imported by the U.S. is from its northern neighbor, according to federal statistics published in November. In total about 80% of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported.",
      "Losing Canada \u2014 an especially important buyer of American lobster \u2014 as a market for U.S. seafood could cause prices to fishermen to collapse, Sackton said. And some products could become unavailable while others become more expensive and still others oversupplied, he said. He described the seafood industry as \u201cinterdependent on both sides of the border.\u201d",
      "In Canada, members of the country's seafood industry are watching closely to see what changes Trump ushers in, said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "\u201cA potential trade war will cost everyone more (in Canada and the U.S.) and cause damage to the seafood section in Canada and the United States,\u201d Irvine said via email. \u201cWe are working with allies in Canada and the U.S. to send this message to all governments.\u201d",
      "One of the major changes for fishermen under a new Trump administration is that they can expect to have a seat at the table when high-level decisions get made, said representatives for several commercial fishing groups. Last time around, Trump sat down with fishermen and listened to their concerns about loss of fishing rights in Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a nearly 5,000-square mile (13,000 square kilometers) protected area off New England, said Robert Vanasse, executive director of industry advocate Saving Seafood.",
      "That goodwill is likely to carry over into Trump's new presidency. And the industry feels it has already scored a win with election of a president who is an outspoken critic of offshore wind power, said Drew Minkiewicz, an attorney who represents the New Bedford, Massachusetts-based Sustainable Scalloping Fund. Fishermen of valuable seafoods such as scallops and lobsters have long opposed offshore wind development because of concerns wind power will disrupt prime fishing grounds.",
      "\u201cThere is excitement in the industry that offshore wind will basically be contained to its existing footprint and nothing beyond that,\u201d Minkiewicz said.",
      "Others in the industry said they're concerned about how Trump will handle the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency that regulates fisheries. The undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, who is currently the Biden-appointed Rick Spinrad, will be one of Trump's key appointees. Trump went through three different administrators at the post during his first term of office.",
      "The industry has recently suffered major recent crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and trade hostilities with another major trading partner in Russia, and isn't in a position to withstand unstable leadership, said Noah Oppenheim, coordinator for Fishing Communities Coalition, which represents small-scale commercial fishing groups.",
      "\"The Fishing Communities Coalition is always deeply concerned that any administration\u2019s shifts away from a fishery management focus on conservation and accountability will do serious lasting damage to the industry,\" Oppenheim said.",
      "Conservation groups who have pushed for stricter vessel speed rules and new fishing standards, such as new gear that is less likely to harm whales, said they're also waiting to see the direction Trump takes fisheries and ocean policy. They said they're hopeful progress made under Biden can withstand a second Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cIt would be extraordinarily short-sighted for the incoming administration to ignore the science and set off a fishing free-for-all that will only hurt fisheries \u2014 and healthy oceans \u2014 in the long run,\u201d said Jane Davenport, a senior attorney with Defenders of Wildlife.",

      "Romney will be succeeded in the Senate by Republican U.S. Rep. John Curtis, who has developed a reputation for pushing back against party leaders such as Trump who falsely claim climate change is a hoax. Eyes will be on Curtis and other moderate Republicans who might break with the party in votes to confirm Trump\u2019s cabinet picks.",
      "In 2020, Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president from their own party in an impeachment trial. He was the sole Republican in Congress to vote to convict Trump at his two impeachment trials. Trump was acquitted by the Senate both times.",

      "Federal officials detained the 72-year-old in July at Los Angeles International Airport on charges of immigration fraud, specifically that he denied on his U.S. visa and citizenship applications that he had ever persecuted anyone in Syria, according to a criminal complaint. He had purchased a one-way plane ticket to depart LAX on July 10, en route to Beirut, Lebanon.",

      "U.S. authorities accused two Syrian officials of running a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital of Damascus in an indictment unsealed Monday. Victims included Syrians, Americans and dual citizens, including 26-year-old American aid worker Layla Shweikani, according to prosecutors and the Syrian Emergency Task Force.",

      "In May, a French court sentenced three high-ranking Syrian officials in absentia to life in prison for complicity in war crimes in a largely symbolic but landmark case against Assad\u2019s regime and the first such case in Europe.",
      "Al-Sheikh began his career working police command posts before transferring to Syria\u2019s state security apparatus, which focused on countering political dissent, officials said. He later became head of Adra Prison and brigadier general in 2005. In 2011, he was appointed governor of Deir ez-Zour, a region northeast of the Syrian capital of Damascus, where there were violent crackdowns against protesters.",
      "The indictment alleges that al-Sheikh immigrated to the U.S. in 2020 and applied for citizenship in 2023.",
      "If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy to commit torture charge and each of the three torture charges, plus a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each of the two immigration fraud charges."

The original indictment was dismissed earlier this year after a state judge ruled that Clark County, the state\u2019s most populous county and home to Las Vegas, was the wrong venue for the case.",

Justice requires that these actions not go unpunished.\u201d",

      "Released Thursday, the budget blueprint would increase general fund spending by about $720 million to $10.9 billion, a roughly 7% increase for the fiscal year running from July 2025 through June 2026.",

Public schools are confronting new financial demands as they extend school calendars in efforts to improve academic performance, even as enrollment drops. The budget plan would shore up funding for free school meals and literacy initiatives including tutoring and summer reading programs.",
      "A proposed $206 million spending increase on early childhood education aims to expand participation in preschool and childcare at little or no cost to most families \u2014 especially those with children ages 3 and under.

Roy Cooper and Gov.-elect Josh Stein on Thursday challenged the constitutionality of a portion of a law enacted just a day earlier by the Republican-dominated General Assembly that erodes Stein's powers and those of other top Democrats elected to statewide office last month.",
      "Stein, the outgoing attorney general, and Cooper, another Democrat leaving office shortly after eight years on the job, focused their lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court on a provision that would prevent Stein from picking his own commander of the State Highway Patrol. If that portion of law is allowed to stand, the current commander appointed by Cooper more than three years ago could be poised to stay in place through June 2030 \u2014 18 months after the expiration of the term Stein was elected to.",
      "The lawsuit said the provision would give the current commander, Col. Freddy Johnson, an exclusive five-year appointment. It also would prevent the governor from ensuring state laws are faithfully executed through his core executive and law enforcement functions, since the commander would be effectively unaccountable, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cThis law threatens public safety, fractures the chain of command during a crisis, and thwarts the will of voters,\u201d Stein said in a news release. \"Our people deserve better than a power-hungry legislature that puts political games ahead of public safety.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit seeks to block the General Assembly's restriction on the appointment while the litigation is pending and to ultimately declare the provision in violation of the North Carolina Constitution.",
      "More court challenges are likely.",
      "The full law was given final approval Wednesday with a successful House override vote of Cooper's veto. It also shifts in May the appointment powers of the State Board of Elections from the governor to the state auditor \u2014 who next month will be a Republican. The powers of the governor to fill vacancies on the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals also were weakened. And the attorney general \u2014 next to be Democrat Jeff Jackson \u2014 will be prevented from taking legal positions contrary to the General Assembly in litigation challenging a law\u2019s validity.",
      "The Highway Patrol has been an agency under the Cabinet-level Department of Public Safety, with the leader of troopers picked to serve at the governor's pleasure. The new law makes the patrol an independent, Cabinet-level department and asks the governor to name a commander to serve a five-year term, subject to General Assembly confirmation.",
      "But language in the law states initially that the patrol commander on a certain day last month \u2014 Johnson is unnamed \u2014 would continue to serve until next July and carry out the five-year term \u201cwithout additional nomination by the Governor or confirmation by the General Assembly.\" Only death, resignation or incapacity could change that.",
      "This configuration could result in the \u201clegislatively-appointed commander\u201d feeling empowered to delay or reject directions of the governor because his post is secure, the lawsuit said.",
      "Spokespeople for House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger didn't immediately respond Thursday evening to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. Neither did Johnson, through a patrol spokesperson. All three leaders, in their official roles, are named as lawsuit defendants."

      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while sheriff\u2019s deputies pushed him into a courthouse.",
      "There\u2019s no indication Mangione was ever insured by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an interview Thursday with NBC New York.",
      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.",
      "Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione\u2019s arrest, but little information has emerged about his recent mental and physical health.",
      "Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts reference a spinal condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when a fracture causes a vertebra to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on spinal nerves.",
      "The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione\u2019s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.",
      "After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a theme in his time there,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a big complainer. So it wasn\u2019t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.\u201d",
      "In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.",
      "\u201cI got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20\u2019s and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to his posts, the operation was a success.",
      "An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal rod and multiple screws inserted into his lower spine.",
      "\u201cSurgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,\u201d Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. \u201cObviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.\u201d",
      "Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.",
      "\u201cIn the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,\u201d said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Center at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",
      "Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.",
      "\u201cIf you have underlying mental health issues \u2014 anxiety, depression \u2014 your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,\u201d Gulur said. \u201cBut, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "Little is known about Mangione\u2019s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.",
      "His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November, police said.",
      "Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain fog and restless sleep.",
      "In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, \u201cstaying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn\u2019t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk 's company on Thursday sent a letter to local officials requesting an election to turn what it calls Starbase \u2014 the South Texas site where SpaceX builds and launches its massive Starship rockets \u2014 into an incorporated city. Residents of the area known as Starbase submitted the petition, according to the company.",
      "The area is on the southern tip of Texas at Boca Chica Beach, near the Mexican border. Earlier this year, Musk announced he was moving the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media company X from California to Texas.",
      "\u201cTo continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community. That is why we are requesting that Cameron County call an election to enable the incorporation of Starbase as the newest city in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d Kathryn Lueders, the general manager of Starbase, wrote in a letter to the county.",
      "It's not the first time turning Starbase into its own city has been floated. Musk proposed the idea in 2021 when he wrote a social media post that simply said, \u201cCreating the city of Starbase, Texas.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is offering his support for the dockworkers union before their contract expires next month at Eastern and Gulf Coast ports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday voiced his support for the dockworkers union before their contract expires next month at Eastern and Gulf Coast ports, saying that any further \u201cautomation\u201d of the ports would harm workers.",
      "The incoming president posted on social media that he met Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoreman's Association, and Dennis Daggett, the union's executive vice president.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen. Foreign companies have made a fortune in the U.S. by giving them access to our markets. They shouldn\u2019t be looking for every last penny knowing how many families are hurt.\u201d",
      "The International Longshoremen\u2019s Association has until Jan. 15 to negotiate a new contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is whether ports can install automated gates, cranes and container-moving trucks that could make it faster to unload and load ships. The union argues that automation would lead to fewer jobs, even though higher levels of productivity could do more to boost the salaries of remaining workers.",
      "The Maritime Alliance said in a statement that the contract goes beyond ports to \u201csupporting American consumers and giving American businesses access to the global marketplace \u2013 from farmers, to manufacturers, to small businesses, and innovative start-ups looking for new markets to sell their products.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo achieve this, we need modern technology that is proven to improve worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and strengthen our supply chains,\u201d said the alliance, adding that it looks forward to working with Trump.",
      "In October, the union representing 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for three days, raising the risk that a prolonged shutdown could push up inflation by making it difficult to unload container ships and export American products overseas.",
      "The issue pits an incoming president who won November's election on the promise of bringing down prices against commitments to support blue-collar workers along with the kinds of advanced technology that drew him support from Silicon Valley elite such as billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Trump sought to portray the dispute as being between U.S. workers and foreign companies, but advanced ports are also key for staying globally competitive. China is opening a $1.3 billion port in Peru that could accommodate ships too large for the Panama Canal.",
      "There is a risk that shippers could move to other ports, which could also lead to job losses. Mexico is constructing a port that is highly automated, while Dubai, Singapore and Rotterdam already have more advanced ports.",
      "Instead, Trump said that ports and shipping companies should eschew \u201cmachinery, which is expensive, and which will constantly have to be replaced.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cIt is time to put AMERICA FIRST!\u201d",

      "The popularity of drones has exploded in recent years, as small unmanned aircraft have become cheap enough for many hobbyists to buy",

      "No-fly zones are enforced around airports, military installations, nuclear plants, certain landmarks including the Statue of Liberty, and sports stadiums during games.",
      "Not everybody follows the rules. Sightings at airports have shut down flights in a few instances.",
      "Reported sightings of what appear to be drones flying over New Jersey at night in recent weeks have created anxiety among some residents, in part because it is not clear who is operating them or why. Some state and local officials have called for stricter rules to govern drones.",
      "After receiving reports of drone activity last month near Morris County, New Jersey, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary bans on drone flights over a golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, that is owned by President-elect Donald Trump, and over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base. The FAA says the bans are in response to requests from \u201cfederal security partners.\u201d",

      "Yes, but the FAA imposes restrictions on nighttime operations. Most drones are not allowed to fly at night unless they are equipped with anti-collision lights that are visible for at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).",
      "Over the past decade, pilots have reported hundreds of close calls between drones and airplanes including airline jets. In some cases, airplane pilots have had to take evasive action to avoid collisions.",
      "Drones buzzing over a runway caused flights to be stopped at London\u2019s Gatwick Airport during the Christmas travel rush in 2018 and again in May 2023. Police dismissed the idea of shooting down the drones, fearing that stray bullets could kill someone.",

      "Some state and local officials in New Jersey are calling for stronger restrictions because of the recent sightings, and that has the drone industry worried.",

      "\u201cIt's a brand new technology that's not really understood real well, so it will raise fear and anxiety in a lot of people,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe want to be good professional aviators and alleviate that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The White House has announced what it called the first-ever national strategy to counter Islamophobia",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House on Thursday announced what it called the first-ever national strategy to counter Islamophobia, detailing more than 100 steps federal officials are taking to curb hate, violence, bias and discrimination against Muslims and Arab Americans.",
      "The proposal follows a similar national plan to battle antisemitism that President Joe Biden unveiled in May 2023, as fears about increasing hatred and discrimination were rising among U.S. Jews.",
      "Officials worked on the anti-Islamophobia plan for months, and its release came five weeks before Biden leaves office. The White House said the bulk of its actions had been implemented, with the goal to roll out the rest before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "In a statement announcing the strategy, the Biden administration wrote, \u201cOver the past year, this initiative has become even more important as threats against American Muslim and Arab communities have spiked.\u201d It said that included the October 2023 slaying of 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi, an American Muslim boy of Palestinian descent, who was stabbed to death in Illinois.",
      "The plan details actions the Executive Branch is taking, along with more than 100 other calls to action across all sectors of society.",
      "The strategy has four basic priorities: increasing awareness of hatred against Muslims and Arabs while more widely recognizing these communities' heritages; broadly improving their safety and security; appropriately accommodating Muslim and Arab religious practices by working to curb discrimination against them; and encouraging cross-community solidarity to further counter hate.",
      "Many of those state goals are similar to the ones the Biden administration laid out in its plan to reduce antisemitism \u2014 especially the emphasis on improving safety and security and building cross-community solidarity.",
      "\u201cWhile individuals have sometimes been targeted because they are thought to be Muslim, it is also crucial to recognize that Arabs are routinely targeted simply for being who they are,\u201d the announcement of the strategy states, noting that Muslims and Arab Americans have helped build out the nation since its founding. It says that new data collection and education efforts are \u201cincreasing awareness of these forms of hate as well of the proud heritages of Muslim and Arab Americans.\u201d",
      "The plan calls for more widely disseminating successful practices of engaging Muslim and Arab Americans in the reporting of hate crimes, and that federal agencies are now more clearly spelling out that \u201cdiscrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans in federally funded activities is illegal.\u201d",
      "The White House\u2019s plan also urges \u201cstate, local, and international counterparts, as well as the nongovernmental sector, to pursue similar initiatives that seek to build greater unity by recognizing our common humanity, affirming our shared values and history, and embracing equal justice, liberty, and security for all.\"",
      "Pro-Palestinian groups decrying his administration\u2019s full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza frequently disrupted Biden campaign events, as well as those of Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden abandoned his reelection bid in July.",
      "Trump, who implemented a travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries during his first term, won the largest majority-Muslim U.S. city in last month's elections. Yet some Arab Americans who backed Trump have begun expressing concerns about his some of his choices to fill out his Cabinet and other picks for his incoming administration.",

      "The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic says it hasn't settled on any future plans to retrieve more artifacts from the shipwreck",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic said Thursday that it hasn't settled on plans to retrieve more artifacts from the shipwreck, potentially cooling down a legal battle with the U.S. government.",
      "The Georgia-based company, RMS Titanic Inc., wrote in a court filing that it won't visit the wreck in 2025 and is still considering the legal and financial implications of future salvage operations. The court-recognized steward of Titanic artifacts since 1994, RMST has recovered thousands of items from silverware to a piece of the ship\u2019s hull, which millions of people have seen through exhibits.",
      "The U.S. has been warning RMST for years that entering the Titanic\u2019s severed hull \u2014 or disturbing the wreck \u2014 would violate a 2017 federal law and a corresponding agreement with Great Britain. Both regard the site as a memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the ocean liner struck a North Atlantic iceberg in 1912.",
      "The firm's last salvage expedition was in 2010, before the law and agreement took effect. But in recent years, RMST has submitted plans before a federal admiralty court in Virginia to recover more artifacts, drawing the ire of the U.S. government.",
      "RMST has previously challenged the constitutionality of U.S. efforts to \u201cinfringe\u201d on its salvage rights to a shipwreck in international waters. And it has argued that only the admiralty court has jurisdiction over the matter.",
      "The recent legal disputes between RMST and the U.S. government have played out as the world's most famous shipwreck rapidly deteriorates on the ocean floor \u2014 and as tragedy unfolded. Last year's implosion of the Titan submersible claimed five lives, including RMST\u2019s director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet,",
      "RMST's stated its position regarding future expeditions on Thursday at the admiralty court's direction. A federal judge has been considering a legal challenge by the U.S. to restrict RMST's activities at the site.",
      "The U.S. filed its challenge last year when RMST initially planned to take images inside the sunken ship's hull and pluck items from the surrounding debris field. RMST also said it would possibly recover freestanding objects from the room where the Titanic broadcast its distress calls.",
      "The company ultimately scaled back its dive plans, stating that it would only take external images. That was because of Nargeolet's death in the Titan implosion. The experimental craft was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending his expertise. Nargeolet was supposed to lead the RMST expedition.",
      "After RMST revised its dive plans, the U.S. stopped trying to block that particular expedition, which occurred over the summer. But the U.S. told the court it wanted to leave the door open to challenging subsequent expeditions.",
      "Specifically, the government said it may still pursue its motion to intervene as a party in RMST\u2019s salvage case. The U.S. asked the court to delay ruling on the motion until the company announced future salvage plans.",
      "The firm said Thursday that it needs more time to make a decision on any upcoming operations. RMST also said it opposes the U.S.'s motion to intervene.",
      "U. S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith presides over Titanic salvage matters at the federal court in Norfolk, Virginia. She said during a March hearing that the U.S.\u2019s case against RMST would raise serious legal questions.",
      "Congress is allowed to modify maritime law, Smith said in reference to regulating entry into the Titanic. But the judge questioned whether Congress can strip courts of their own admiralty jurisdiction over a shipwreck, something that has centuries of legal precedent.",
      "In 2020, Smithgave RMST permission to retrieve and exhibit the radio that had broadcast the Titanic\u2019s distress calls. The U.S. government challenged the expedition in court.",
      "The legal battle never played out. RMST indefinitely delayed those plans because of the coronavirus pandemic."

      "UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S. health insurer.",

Afterward, he posted that the operation had been a success and that his pain had improved and mobility returned. He urged others to consider the same type of surgery.",

      "But Carl Skau said in an interview with The Associated Press this week that the Rome-based agency has been forced to make major cuts to the numbers of people it can help because of a lack of funding.",
      "WFP is working to diversify its funding, including targeting the private sector, but Skau said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a tough time ahead, no doubt, with increasing gaps.\u201d",
      "\u201cNeeds continue to rise, and the funding does not even remain stable at the levels we have currently,\u201d he said.",
      "Syria is facing the fallout from a 13-year civil war, the surge in arrivals from the recent Israel-Hezbollah war in neighboring Lebanon, and rebels unexpectedly ousting longtime leader Bashar Assad, Skau said.",
      "Even before Lebanon and the end of the Assad family\u2019s more than 50-year rule, he said 3 million people were acutely food insecure and very hungry. But the agency was only providing food aid to 2 million because of funding cuts.",
      "Now, Skau said, \u201cit\u2019s a triple crisis, and the needs are going to be massive.\u201d",
      "While the situation in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, is \u201cquite calm and orderly,\u201d he said there is still uncertainty in the capital, Damascus, where markets are disrupted, currency values have dropped, food prices are going up and transport isn\u2019t working.",
      "This means a bigger humanitarian response in the short term. In the next phase, the U.N. will be focusing on Syria\u2019s recovery and ultimately its reconstruction, Skau said.",
      "Skau says the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire but he\u2019s equally worried about southern Gaza, \u201cif not even more,\u201d because of the million or so people on the beach north of Khan Younis as winter approaches.",
      "In northern areas, where the U.N. estimates there are still 65,000 Palestinians and no aid has arrived for more than two months, Skau said Israeli military operations, lawlessness and taking of food aid have prevented access to the needy.",
      "He said some humanitarian convoys have gotten through to the broader northern area including Gaza City, where the U.N. estimates some 300,000 people are located.",
      "In the south, Skau said, WFP assisted around 1.2 million people in June, July, August and into September. In October and November, only one-third of that number \u2014 400,000 Palestinians \u2014 got aid. At the same time, the entry of essential commercial goods was very little compared with the summer months, Skau said.",
      "He blamed the limited number of entry points and the inability to move food to WFP warehouses as well as the \u201ctotal breakdown of civil and public order.\u201d",
      "Skau said international famine experts reported three weeks ago that if nothing changed there would be famine in Gaza, \u201cand I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading.\u201d",
      "The needs are overwhelming: 25 million people in war-torn Sudan are acutely food insecure, with famine declared in the huge Zam Zam camp for the displaced in western Darfur.",
      "Skau cited progress over the past month in getting clearances to deliver aid across conflict lines and the border from Chad. And with roads drying up at the end of the rainy season, WFP is able to deliver \u201cmuch more food.\u201d",
      "One convoy reached Zam Zam camp and two others were on the way but have been held up because of fighting in the past 10 days in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, Skau said.",
      "It is the only capital in Darfur still held by Sudanese forces. The others are held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur.",
      "WFP reached some 2.6 million people this month, Skau said, stressing that the international community should have done more to address the Sudan crisis \u201cand needs to do more going forward.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A northern Wisconsin tribe and a coalition of groups are moving to block plans to reroute an aging pipeline around the tribe's reservation",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A northern Wisconsin tribe along with a coalition of groups moved Thursday to block plans to reroute an aging pipeline around the tribe's reservation, arguing state regulators have underestimated the environmental damage that construction would cause.",
      "The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa filed a lawsuit in Ashland County asking a judge to stay the state Department of Natural Resources' environmental impact statement for the project and reverse state construction permits. The tribe also joined with a number of other groups, including Clean Wisconsin, the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters, in petitions Thursday demanding a hearing on the approvals.",
      "The tribe and its allies argue in the lawsuit and hearing petitions that the DNR couldn't legally approve the reroute because Enbridge didn't show how it would minimize harm to state waterways and wetlands, and the company is underestimating the impacts while overestimating its ability to restore the environment.",
      "\u201cIn my view, the DNR failed our children when it gave Enbridge the permits to build this reroute,\" Bad River Chairperson Robert Blanchard said in a news release announcing Thursday's actions. \u201cAs a tribal chairman and an elder, it's my responsibility to protect the generations still to come. That is why we are fighting this reroute in court.\u201d",
      "DNR spokesperson Molly Meister declined to comment.",
      "Enbridge officials said in a statement that the reroute proposal has gone through rigorous reviews and studies, and that the new challenges will delay an economic boost for northern Wisconsin. The company promised the reroute work would create more than 700 jobs and preserve the flow of energy that millions of people across the region need every day.",
      "Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters) of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, in Canada. About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the pipeline run across the Bad River's reservation on the shores of Lake Superior in Ashland County.",
      "The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the pipeline from the reservation. The band argued land easements allowing Enbridge to operate on the reservation expired in 2013 and the 71-year-old pipeline is prone to a catastrophic spill that would devastate the local watershed and ruin the tribe's sacred wild rice beds.",
      "A federal judge ultimately ruled that Enbridge must remove the pipeline from the reservation by 2026. The energy company has asked a federal appellate court in Chicago to review that decision.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation's southern border. The tribe and conservationists oppose that plan, saying construction efforts would pollute the environment and the reroute would only perpetuate the use of fossil fuels.",
      "The DNR issued state permits for the reroute in November. The project still requires permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "Michigan\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in a federal appellate court.",
      "Michigan regulators in December approved the company\u2019s $500 million plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."

      "WASHINGTON -- Chinese leader Xi Jinping would likely see President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s invitation to attend his inauguration as too risky to accept, and the gesture from Trump may have little bearing on the increasingly competitive ties between the two nations as the White House changes hands, experts say.",
      "Trump\u2019s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump extended an invitation to the Jan. 20 ceremony. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said it had no information to provide. But experts don't see Xi coming to Washington next month.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine Xi Jinping sitting outdoors in Washington, D.C., in January at the feet of the podium, surrounded by hawkish members of Congress, gazing up at Donald Trump as he delivers his inaugural address?\u201d said Danny Russel, who previously served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.",
      "Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Xi would not allow himself to \u201cbe reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader \u2014 the U.S. president, no less.\u201d",
      "Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, said Beijing will play it safe when there's no protocol or precedent for a Chinese leader to attend the inauguration of a U.S. president.",
      "\u201cI don't think the Chinese will take the risk,\u201d Sun said. There could be risks in the guest list, for example, Sun said, noting that Taiwan's top diplomat in the U.S. attended the swearing-in of President Joe Biden in 2021. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory and has repeatedly warned the U.S. that it is a red line not to be crossed.",
      "Should Trump slap tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods upon taking office as he's threatened, Xi would look like a fool if he had chosen to attend, and that's unacceptable to Beijing, Sun said.",
      "Rather, Chinese officials are known for their obsession with the dignity and security of their leader when traveling abroad, said Russel, who has negotiated high-level summits with the Chinese. \u201cThey have always demanded that any leader trip to Washington be treated as a full \u2018state visit\u2019 with all the bells and whistles,\u201d Russel said.",
      "But it should be expected that planning is underway for Trump and Xi to meet in person soon, Russel said. Trump prefers in-person meetings with foreign leaders, especially key adversaries, and Beijing might believe it can get a better deal by dealing directly with Trump, Russel said.",
      "Trump's return to the White House is expected to further intensify the U.S.-China rivalry. He has picked several China hawks for his Cabinet, including Sen. Marco Rubio as the secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz as the national security adviser.",
      "Beijing has adopted a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach but says it is prepared to hit back should Washington raise tariffs on Chinese goods or make other unfriendly moves.",
      "Sun of the Stimson Center cautions that Trump's invitation does not exclude hostile policies toward China. Trump visited China in 2017 and \u201cplayed nice,\u201d but the following year he launched the trade war, she said.",
      "\u201cWe've seen this before,\u201d Sun said. \u201cFor Trump, there's no contradiction between carrot and stick. For China, that's a contradiction. It will add to China's desire to play safe, not to be played by Trump, whether it is a friendly or a hostile message.\u201d"

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has met with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming \u201cborder czar.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming \u201cborder czar\u201d on Thursday, with the Democratic mayor expressing an enthusiasm to work with the incoming administration to pursue violent criminals in the city while Trump promises mass deportations.",
      "The mayor's meeting with Tom Homan, who will oversee the southern and northern borders and be responsible for deportation efforts in the Trump administration, came as Adams has welcomed parts of the president-elect's hardline immigration platform.",
      "Adams told reporters at a brief news conference that he and Homan agreed on pursuing people who commit violent crimes in the city but did not disclose additional details or future plans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be a safe haven for those who commit repeated violent crimes against innocent migrants, immigrants and longstanding New Yorkers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my conversation today with the border czar, to figure out how to go after those individuals who are repeatedly committing crimes in our city.\u201d",
      "Homan said the two connected as career law enforcement officers and that he came away from the meeting with \u201ca whole new outlook on the mayor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve called him out this past year, many times, about being more of a politician than a police officer. I was wrong,\u201d Homan said during an interview with Dr. Phil McGraw on his Merit TV network. \u201cHe came through today as a police officer and a mayor that cares about the safety and security of his city.\u201d",
      "The meeting marked Adams' latest and most definitive step toward collaborating with the Trump administration, a development that has startled critics in one of the country's most liberal cities.",
      "In the weeks since Trump\u2019s election win, Adams has mused about potentially scaling back the city\u2019s so-called sanctuary policies and coordinating with the incoming administration on immigration. He has also said migrants accused of crimes shouldn\u2019t have due process rights under the Constitution, though he eventually walked back those comments.",
      "The mayor further stunned Democrats when he sidestepped questions last week on whether he would consider changing parties to become a Republican, telling journalists that he was part of the \u201cAmerican party.\u201d Adams later clarified that he would remain a Democrat.",
      "For Adams, a centrist Democrat known for quarreling with the city's progressive left, the recent comments on immigration follow frustration with the Biden administration over its immigration policies and a surge of international migrants in the city.",
      "He has maintained his positions have not changed and argues he's trying to protect New Yorkers, pointing to the law-and-order platform he has staked out throughout his political career and while running for mayor.",
      "At his news conference Thursday, Adams reiterated his commitment to New York\u2019s generous social safety net.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to tell those who are here, who are law-abiding, to continue to utilize the services that are open to the city, the services that they have a right to utilize, educating their children, health care, public protection,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will not be the safe haven for those who commit violent acts.\u201d",
      "While the education of all children present in the U.S. is already guaranteed by a Supreme Court ruling, New York also offers social services like healthcare and emergency shelter to low-income residents, including those in the country illegally. City and state grants also provide significant access to lawyers, which is not guaranteed in the immigration court as they are in the criminal court.",
      "Still, Adams\u2019 recent rhetoric has been seen by some critics as an attempt to cozy up to Trump, who could potentially offer a presidential pardon in his federal corruption case. Adams has been charged with accepting luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals looking to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Homan, who was Trump\u2019s former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, also met this week with Republicans in Illinois, where he called on Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, to start negotiations over how Trump's mass deportation plans, according to local media.",
      "While meeting with Adams, Homan said, \u201cWe traded ideas, we traded, strategies. He told me what he liked and didn\u2019t like about immigration policies. ... There\u2019s things we don\u2019t agree on, but we agree on the most important things.\u201d",
      "Separately, New York City officials this week announced continued efforts to shrink a huge emergency shelter system for migrants because of a steady decline in new arrivals. Among planned shelter closures is a massive tent complex built on a federally owned former airport in Brooklyn, which advocates warned could be a prime target for Trump's mass deportation plan.",
      "Elsewhere, Republican governors and lawmakers in some states are rolling out proposals that could help Trump carry out his promised deportations.",

      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",

      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Energy firms will be forced to offer customers tariffs with no standing charges, under a proposed shake-up of bills by regulator Ofgem.",
      "All households pay the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, but there have been widespread calls for these fees to be scrapped.",
      "Ofgem is proposing suppliers offer one price-capped tariff that includes the standing charge, and another that loads these costs on energy usage charges instead. Customers could choose which suits them best.",
      "The planned overhaul, for next winter, also raises the possibility of some unpaid bills that built up during a recent high-price crisis to be written off.",
      "Standing charge anger",
      "When Ofgem asked for the public's views on standing charges it received an unprecedented response of 30,000 submissions.",
      "The majority were against standing charges - fixed fees, typically totalling more than \u00a3300 a year, that are paid irrespective of how much energy households use.",
      "Under Ofgem's price cap, standing charges have risen by 43% since 2019.",
      "Those with low energy usage, such as people who live alone, argued that even if they further reduced how much gas and electricity they used, they saw little difference in their bills. They wanted more control over their bills.",
      "However, those with high energy needs could see a big rise in bills were these charges to be included in the price of each unit of energy used. It would mean higher bills for people with disabilities who have to charge up specialist equipment.",
      "\"We hear from people who've turned off their heating, ration their hot water, and avoid charging essential mobility devices, yet still feel like they're fighting a losing battle with their energy bills,\" said Alex Belsham-Harris from Citizens Advice.",
      "Ofgem's proposed solution is to tell energy firms to make a dual pricing offer - one with, and one without, a standing charge. The tariff without a standing charge would have a higher price for each unit of energy. Both would fall under the existing price cap system.",
      "Such tariffs already exist, but only from a handful of suppliers and are not available to everyone.",
      "Customers would need to make a choice, but some campaigners want those with low energy use to automatically move on to a deal free of standing charges.",
      "\"The problem with presenting a choice of price caps is many vulnerable people won't make that choice,\" said Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert.",
      "One of those who could benefit would be Joanne Wilkinson.",
      "\"I try not to look [at the standing charges] because it's depressing,\" she said.",
      "She said she had enough to worry about dealing with baby daughter Adeline, but noticed how quickly the meter goes through the money that was loaded on to it.",
      "Lower wages in the north of England made it even harder for parents like her to afford energy bills, she said, especially as she was still on maternity leave.",
      "But Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said that such a fundamental proposed change needed careful consideration.",
      "\"It would be a major undertaking to make all customers aware of this change and to ensure they then choose the best option for their circumstances,\" said the trade body's chief executive, Dhara Vyas.",
      "She told the BBC the addition of a zero standing charge price cap option would \"quite significantly change the nature of the price cap\".",
      "\"It would go from being one single regulated price that gives customers protection whether or not they switch, to a situation where I think customers might be expected to make an active choice about which cap they are on.\"",
      "Asked whether standing charges should be scrapped altogether, Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told the BBC the option had been looked at, but added the costs \"need to appear in bills somewhere\".",
      "He said moving costs into unit rates could have \"some quite bad effects on people in some of the most vulnerable situations\".",
      "The regulator's proposals do not deal with the variation of standing charges in different parts of the UK, with billpayers in some areas paying considerably more. Ofgem intends to make that part of a wider, separate inquiry.",
      "Debt repayment plan",
      "The amount of money owed to suppliers by customers has nearly doubled in two years, now totalling about \u00a33.8bn.",
      "The regulator is also setting out a plan for next winter that would deal with some of this debt, built up during a period of high prices, that has little chance of being repaid.",
      "It is planning a \"debt guarantee\" to improve the standard of service offered by suppliers supporting customers in debt, which it said would give households \"consistent, compassionate and tailored support\".",
      "Suppliers could also be required to accept debt repayment offers from reputable third parties such as debt advice agencies or consumer organisations."

      "The decision is an indication of the increased financial breathing room being felt by millions of Americans, as petrol prices drop to their lowest level for three years, helping to contain rising living costs.",
      "US inflation - the rate at which prices increase - rose slightly to 2.7% last month, official figures showed. Despite the increase, prices are rising far more slowly than in June 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked turmoil in global oil markets and sent fuel prices soaring.",
      "Though the progress has appeared in economic data for months, economic dissatisfaction has remained high, as price increases in other areas, such as housing, overshadowed the wider improvement.",
      "The issue played a key role in the US election, helping Donald Trump win re-election to the White House last month.",
      "Now, however, surveys suggest opinions about the economy are finally starting to brighten, driven in large part by increased confidence among supporters of Trump, Mr Kerben among them, after the former president's election victory.",
      "\"Compared to two months ago, I would say I feel more confident,\" the 36-year-old property manager said. \"Hopefully Trump will do something.\"",
      "Ironically, the improvement in sentiment is arriving just as progress containing prices has appeared to stall.",
      "The 2.7% inflation rate for November had been expected.",
      "But it was up from 2.6% in October, marking the highest rate since July.",
      "Gas prices - though down 8.1% compared with 2023 - rose 0.6% from October, while grocery prices jumped 0.5% over the month.",
      "Prices of used cars, household furnishings and medical care also climbed.",
      "The situation has raised questions about how Trump will deliver on his promises to lower prices for Americans - and what the US central bank, which wants to see an inflation rate of about 2%, should do next.",
      "\"Inflation has been coming steadily back into focus in the US,\" said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors.",
      "\"This is due in part to the lack of progress that has been made over the last three months, but also because of concerns that higher US government spending plus the introduction of Trump's tariffs could create a more inflationary backdrop.\"",
      "The US central bank lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years in September, citing the progress stabilising prices.",
      "Many analysts still expect officials to announce another cut to interest rates at their meeting this month, but they have warned that rates are likely to stay higher than previously expected next year unless price increases in areas outside of petrol start to ease more significantly.",

      "However, the rate at which rents are rising is now the slowest for three years, the property portal has said, as potential tenants face limits on what they can afford.",
      "But average earnings in the past three years have not kept pace with the steep rise in rents.",
      "Renters have faced a \"red-hot\" market in recent years, with a host of prospective tenants chasing each available property, and rents surging on the back of the high demand. Demand is nearly a third higher than before the pandemic.",

      "The property portal has forecast rents rising at an average rate of 4% next year, with demand still outstripping supply.",

      "Mencap is one of a growing number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services because of the impact of the Budget.",
      "Businesses - including charities - currently pay a rate of 13.8% National Insurance on employees' earnings above \u00a39,100 a year. But that will increase to 15% in April 2025, instead starting when wages reach \u00a35,000.",
      "Mencap says the rise will cost it \u00a35.3m every year.",
      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",
      "Local authorities, who pay for most social care for older and disabled people, say the rising costs for the sector are \"insurmountable\".",
      "The government says it is tackling the challenges facing adult social care, as well as providing it with extra money as part of \u00a33.5bn in additional funding for councils in England next year.",
      "Round-the-clock support",
      "Twenty-six people with a range of learning disabilities live at Churchfields, in Essex. It is one of 600 services run by Mencap across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",
      "But with both, their faces and reactions can tell their story more eloquently than words.",

      "\"The quality of life you give to these people is the experience they have in their life,\" he says.",
      "It takes 50 staff to support the people at Churchfields to live full lives. Mencap employs about 7,500 staff across all its services. Many care workers are on low pay.",
      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",
      "But if the charity increases everyone's salary to maintain pay differences that reflect levels of experience and responsibility, then it says the annual additional costs could rise to \u00a318m.",
      "Mencap's chief executive, Jon Sparkes, told the BBC it may have to stop running at least 60 services.",
      "\"They are services that provide basic daily social care, support for 200 people with a learning disability, and services that employ about 400 people,\" he says. \"Those are the services I'm worried about immediately.\"",
      "He warned: \"It could be more.\"",
      "Local authorities pay the charity to support people with learning disabilities, so in practice it would be handing contracts back to councils.",
      "Mr Sparkes says unless there is a substantial increase in fees they will have to tell councils \"we can't afford to run this service safely on the funding that we're getting\".",
      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",
      "Dr Jane Townson, of the Homecare Association, representing providers who support people in their own homes, is worried there is a real risk of a \"significant reduction in care and support services\".",
      "She fears that will leave some people without essential services, and increase the pressure on families and the NHS.",
      "\"We are at a tipping point and need immediate government intervention,\" she says.",
      "Most social care in England is funded by councils. Care providers estimate that just to cover the increased costs of the national minimum wage and NICs fees for their services would need to increase by 9-10% next year.",
      "But local authorities are also under huge financial pressure. Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), represents the people who run council social care.",
      "She says local authorities are already struggling financially, facing inflationary costs and increasing demand from people who need more complex care.",

    "summary": "The company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the first half of the year as its debts continued to swell.",
    "story": [
      "The boss of Thames Water has defended executive bonuses as the firm calls for a hike in customer bills to ensure its survival.",
      "Chris Weston said the supplier needed to offer \"competitive packages\" to attract talent, but the water regulator has previously said that customers must not foot the bill for \"undeserved bonuses\".",
      "It comes as the embattled company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the six months to 30 September, as its debts continued to swell, according to its latest set of results.",
      "Thames approaches a critical moment next week, with Ofwat set to decide whether to allow a proposed 59% increase in consumer bills over the next five years.",
      "The ailing business is saddled with debts which stood at just under \u00a316bn at the end of September.",
      "The firm has said customer bills need to rise or else it will not be able to recover from its financial crisis. However, if the company does collapse, water supplies will not be affected.",
      "Water firms across the UK have faced a fierce backlash over sewage discharges and pipe leaks in recent years, but Thames has been in the spotlight given its debt pile, and the fact one in four people in the UK rely on it.",
      "Critics have argued the water industry has historically neglected investment in favour of paying executive bonuses and shareholder dividends.",
      "But on Tuesday, Mr Weston defended bosses getting \u00a3770,000 in bonuses.",
      "\"I completely understand that there are customers out there who struggle with their bills,\" he added, pointing to bill support offered to about 377,000 customers in the last year.",
      "Mr Weston, who was hired in January, was also awarded a bonus of \u00a3195,000 for his first three months at the company.",
      "The regulator Ofwat recently blocked three companies, including Thames, from using customer money to pay executive bonuses as bills have steadily increased.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "A final decision on whether Thames can increase its bills by 59% is due on 19 December.",
      "Mr Weston described the upcoming decision as a \"critical\" step which would be \"fundamental\" to the company's future.",
      "Bosses have argued they need extra cash to make Thames \"investible\" enough to attract fresh funding, and to pay for improvements to its network of pipes and sewers.",
      "Thames reported a 40% rise in sewage pollution with 359 incidents in the six months to September.",
      "Mr Weston blamed a particularly wet spring and summer period, and said that problems with its infrastructure were \"decades in the making\".",
      "Ofwat has also appointed an independent monitor to supervise Thames as it attempts its turnaround.",
      "Pivotal moment",
      "The company could run out of money within the first three months of 2025, which is why its creditors have offered it a further \u00a33bn cash loan to be released in two tranches, the first \u00a31.5bn of which could be released in February.",
      "It is waiting for a court date next week to approve the cash injection which could prove pivotal as it would mean it had enough money to last until October next year.",
      "An insider told the BBC that if it was not for the firm's huge debt pile, Thames would be in reasonable shape financially.",
      "In its latest results, it reported a profit before tax of \u00a3249.6m for the six months to September, up 20% on the year before.",
      "When Thames Water was privatised in 1989 it had no debt. However, over the years it borrowed heavily.",
      "Thames needs to raise about \u00a34bn in new equity too, which would not need to be paid back.",
      "While there are several interested parties that could put that money in, the investment would depend on how much pain lenders are willing to take and whether or not Ofwat will allow the company to push through steep bill increases.",
      "Mr Weston said on Tuesday there was \"considerable interest\" from potential equity investors in the company.",
      "But the process for an equity injection cannot be finalised until Ofwat makes a decision on bill increases.",
      "Unions argued on Tuesday that a recovery for the company was now \"virtually impossible\".",
      "Gary Carter, the national officer of the GMB union, called for government to step in.",
      "\"Right now the company is being squashed by an ever-increasing debt mountain, on increasingly arduous terms,\" he added.",
      "Unite general secretary Sharon Graham also called for officials to stand up for the \"public interest\" and consider bringing Thames back into public ownership.",
      "Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Weston said that the firm had not asked the government or regulators to step in and implement a form of publicly funded administration, called a special administration regime."

    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

      "The order followed publication of a landmark review earlier this year, by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, into gender care services for children.",
      "It found a lack of evidence around treatment for under-18s with puberty-blocking drugs.",
      "In March, NHS England decided that puberty blockers would no longer be routine treatment for children with gender dysphoria.",
      "Then in May, the Conservative government tightened rules on the drugs, introducing an emergency ban on them being prescribed by private and European prescribers.",
      "This was kept in place by Labour when they came to power in the summer and was subsequently challenged in the High Court. The government won that case.",
      "Announcing the indefinite ban, Streeting said: \"It is a scandal that medicine was given to vulnerable children without the proof that it was safe or effective.\"",
      "But he added that the planned clinical trial by NHS England into the use of puberty blockers would go ahead.",
      "The ban would then be reviewed in 2027, he said, in the light of any new evidence that emerged.",
      "Under-18s who were on the drugs before the ban was introduced have been allowed to continue using them.",
      "Helen Joyce, of the Sex Matters campaign group, said: \"Wes Streeting has shown integrity and bravery in replacing a temporary ban with an indefinite order.",
      "\"It marks another step towards puberty blockers being relegated to a shameful chapter of history, in which parents and health professionals were emotionally blackmailed into harming children in the name of 'progress'.\"",
      "Meanwhile, TransActual's Keyne Walker said the ban smacked of \"discrimination plain and simple\".",

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",

    "story": [
      "2023 was supposed to be Flo's year.",
      "A few months before the calendar flipped over, the London-based girl band made a huge splash with their debut single, Cardboard Box, a sassy kiss-off to a cheating ex that drew on the girl group sounds of En Vogue, SWV and Destiny's Child.",
      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",
      "\"Maybe, for the next tour, we should just get mechanical bulls instead of treadmills.\"",
      "Watch this space."

      "Recent claims from guests - including that cancer can be treated by following a keto diet, rather than proven treatments - were allowed by the Dragons' Den star with little or no challenge. Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",
      "In an analysis of 15 health-related podcast episodes, BBC World Service found each contained an average of 14 harmful health claims that went against extensive scientific evidence.",
      "Flight Studio - the podcast production company owned by Mr Bartlett - said guests were offered \"freedom of expression\" and were \"thoroughly researched\".",
      "The podcast launched in 2017 focusing on entrepreneurship and business. It soared in popularity as figures such as influencer Molly Mae and Airbnb founder Brian Chesky shared their tips for success.",
      "But in the past 18 months, Mr Bartlett has concentrated more on health, with guests presented as leading experts in their fields. Their views receive little challenge.",
      "The interviews are also posted to Mr Bartlett's YouTube channel, which has seven million subscribers. Since this content shift last year, its monthly views have increased from nine million to 15 million.",
      "Mr Bartlett told The Times in April he expected his podcast to make \u00a320m this year, mainly from advertising.",
      "We looked at the 23 health-related episodes released between April and November this year, fact checking - with four medical experts - 15 which contained potentially harmful claims.",
      "The experts we spoke to were cancer research professor David Grimes, public confidence in healthcare professor Heidi Larson, NHS diabetes adviser Dr Partha Kar and surgeon Dr Liz O'Riordan.",
      "We recorded harmful claims as advice that, if followed, could lead to negative health outcomes.",

      "\"That's a very different and not empowering thing. It actually imperils all our health,\" he says.",

      "In the episode, Dr Malhotra says the \"Covid vaccine was a net negative for society\". Analysis by the World Health Organization shows that it saved many lives during the pandemic.",
      "At the end of the episode, Mr Bartlett, who does not have a health background, justified the airing of the discredited views, saying he aimed to \"present some of the other side\" as \"the truth is usually somewhere in the middle\".",
      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",
      "In response to our investigation, Dr Malhotra told the BBC he \"completely accept[s] that there are still some people who disagree with [his views]\" and said that \"does not mean that they have been debunked\".",

      "Cancer researcher Dr Thomas Seyfried appeared on the podcast in October. He is a proponent of using the ketogenic diet, a diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat, to treat cancer.",
      "But Prof Grimes told us doctors warned patients against restricting their diet while undergoing cancer treatment.",
      "\"You could potentially and very realistically get very, very, sick and have a much worse health outcome than if you followed recommended advice from your oncologists,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast, Dr Seyfried also suggested radiotherapy and chemotherapy only improved patients' lifespan by one-to-two months, comparing modern cancer treatments to \"medieval cures\".",
      "Mr Bartlett did not react to this claim.",

      "Dr Thomas Seyfried told us he \"stands by the statements that he made in the interview\".",
      "The solutions these guests are offering are appealing to listeners as they feel tangible and come without the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs, says Prof Heidi Larson, an expert in public confidence in healthcare.",

      "There can be something wistful about even the most cheerful carols - and it's been a difficult year for the King, with his health problems.",
      "But he looked cheerful here, talking to some rather gobsmacked stallholders under the Christmas lights. He always seems energised by the crowds, joking and chatting.",
      "When he was being steered on to the next part of the trip, he still dived across for an impromptu meeting with shoppers, shaking hands and facing the wall of mobile phones.",
      "The trip to the power station seemed to recharge him.",
      "He was introduced to 90-year-old Rita Kelly, who had worked here in the 1950s when the turbines were pumping out power for the capital, and who said she was \"honoured\" to talk about her memories with the King.",
      "\"Working here was a very happy time,\" she said. Although she said the King seemed to know about her \"mischievous\" side, when as a youngster she'd misguidedly tried to go upside one of the huge chimneys.",
      "Not even Father Christmas would have risked that one.",
      "The King visited the Curated Makers Market and saw the stalls for small traders and craftspeople. It was founded by Megan Jones, who has been supported by the King's Trust, formerly known as the Prince's Trust.",

      "Natasha Kutrovatz, who sells her own jewellery, was delighted by the King's interest in people making a living from handmade crafts. \"As a parent, it's a much more flexible way of working,\" she said.",
      "The 1930s power station once produced a fifth of London's electricity, including supplying landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament.",
      "The link to Buckingham Palace had been discreetly labelled as \"Carnaby Street\" in the control room, in case anyone broke in and literally wanted to switch off the Palace lights, said a spokeswoman for the power station.",
      "With the crowds and cameras for the King's visit, it was probably louder inside the halls than when it was generating power.",
      "It's enough to shake Santa's workshop, although in a designer outlet like this, the resident Santa is living in a \"yurt\".",
      "This huge cathedral of the industrial age remains an impressive sight - and the King's mother, when she was still Princess Elizabeth, had come here in 1949 to see the power station operating.",
      "The power station, built with six million bricks, is now filled with shops and places to eat and drink and the King looked up inside this cavernous post-industrial landmark. He waved back to some rather taken-aback shoppers, looking down from the layers of walkways above.",
      "The boiler house is so big that St Paul's Cathedral could fit inside.",
      "The King is known to be interested in architecture and design - and this building, with its four chimneys looking like an upside down coffee table, was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, also responsible for the classic red phone box and Liverpool Anglican Cathedral.",
      "There's a strong sense of design for another business based in the power station - the technology firm, Apple, which the King visited after the Christmas market.",
      "Some might see parallels between Apple computers and the monarchy - a bit expensive but with many dedicated fans who think it's worth it.",
      "The King went into the Apple headquarters to meet chief executive Mr Cook and was shown an example of the firm's artificial technology, which can turn a few squiggles into a fully-fledged illustration.",
      "The computer company has worked with the King's Trust to help provide young people with digital skills and the King unveiled a plaque.",
      "Cook praised the King's \"lifelong commitment to philanthropy and the betterment of humanity\".",
      "There's a message about changed times in how it's Apple that now occupies these old buildings. This power station once used a million tonnes of coal a year, dug up in coalfields in Wales and northern England. It is tech-firms like Apple and designer shops that now fill the huge halls.",
      "And given how much the King has been photographed by mobile phones, there can few people in the country who have seen as many iPhones close up.",
      "At the end of the visit, drawings by children at a nearby primary school were projected on to the giant chimneys, climbing up into the evening sky. As the King left there was more music, with a performance by singer-songwriter Raye.",
      "After all the Christmas trees and conversations, maybe it was time for his own stiff drink."

      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 12:09:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The actor plays Dylan in A Complete Unknown, which focuses on the singer's rise to fame in the 1960s.",
    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",
      "\"The film doesn't claim to understand Dylan, and suggests Dylan might not understand himself, either. That title, it seems, is literal.\"",

      "Who is Tony Buzbee?",

      "\"If I see someone tapping their fingers on a desk, my immediate thought is to chop their fingers off with a knife,\" an anonymous patient confides to a researcher.",
      "Another shares: \"When I see someone making really small repetitive movements, such as my husband bending his toes, I feel physically ill. I hold it back but I want to vomit.\"",
      "Sound familiar? If so, perhaps you too have a condition called misokinesia - a diagnosible hatred of fidgeting.",
      "Scientists are striving to understand more about the phenomenon that has no known cause, as yet.",
      "For the latest research, featured in the journal PLoS One, experts carried out indepth interviews with 21 people belonging to a misokinesia support group.",
      "Common triggers were leg, hand or foot movements - jiggling thighs, twitchy fingers and shuffling shoes.",
      "Pen clicking and hair twiddling were also triggers, though not quite as frequently.",
      "Often people reported some overlap with another more recognised condition called misophonia - an intense dislike of others people's noises, such as heavy breathing or loud eating.",
      "It's impossible to know exactly how many people might be experiencing misokinesia.",
      "One recent Canadian study suggested perhaps one in three of us might be aversely affected by other people fidgeting, experiencing intense feelings of rage, torture and disgust.",
      "I spoke with Dr Jane Gregory, a clinical psychologist at Oxford University in the UK, who has been studying and treating both misokinesia and misophonia.",
      "She told BBC News: \"The two go alongside each other very frequently. Often people have both at the same time.\"",
      "Although there is no good data, Dr Gregory says the conditions are probably suprisingly common.",
      "\"Obviously, people have been experiencing it for a long time but just didn't have a name for it.\"",
      "The severity of people's aversion to fidgeting varies, she tells me.",
      "\"Some people might get really annoyed by fidgeting or repetitive movements but it doesn't impact massively on day-to-day life,\" she says.",
      "Others, however, may \"get a really strong emotional reaction - anger, panic or distress - and just can't filter them out\".",
      "Through Dr Gregory's work, she tends to meet people with more extreme symptoms. Many are adults who have endured misokinesia for years, but some are in their early teens and experiencing it for the first time.",
      "'It just explodes inside you'",
      "Andrea, 62 and from the UK, says she developed misophonia and misokinesia at 13 but that it wasn't recognised at the time.",
      "One of her earliest memories of the condition is being distressed by a girl at school who was picking her nails.",
      "\"Most of misokinesia tends to focus around people's hands - what they are doing with their hands and what they are touching,\" she says.",
      "Another trigger for her is when people partially cover their mouth with their hand while speaking - she struggles to watch and feels like her own mouth is becoming sore when she does.",
      "Andrea says the anger she experiences is explosive and instantaneous.",
      "\"There's no thought process in it. There's no rationale. It just explodes inside you, which is why it is so distressing.\"",
      "She tells me she has tried different strategies to manage her condition, but can't block it out.",
      "Now she shields herself from society, living alone and working from home, and says her whole life is designed around avoiding the things that could distress her.",
      "Andrea says she has lots of supportive friends who understand that she sometimes needs to modify how she interacts with them.",
      "\"It's easier to just withdraw. To try and survive it. You can't keep asking other people not to do things.\"",

      "\"It's silly things like someone is making me a cup of tea and they get the teabag and bounce it up and down, up and down, up and down. Why?",
      "\"Or if someone is sat there wobbling their leg. I can't take my eyes off it. Or if I do look away, I have to look back to see if they are still doing it.\"",
      "She tells the BBC the unpleasant feeling afterwards can eat away at her for hours.",
      "\"I'm not an angry person. It just makes me feel like there is a ball in my stomach that wants to explode. It's not anger, it's feeling really anxious inside.\"",
      "Julie says she is not afraid to ask people to stop doing something that she is finding distressing, but tends to walk away instead.",
      "Her misokinesia makes her unhappy, she tells me.",
      "\"It makes me internalise it. I don't like myself for feeling like this.\"",
      "Hypervigilent inner meerkat",
      "Dr Gregory says the condition can be extremely debilitating and prevent people from focusing and doing normal things.",
      "\"Part of their brain is constantly thinking about this movement,\" she explains.",
      "\"Violent images might pop into their head. They want to grab the person and force them to stop... even though they are not angry in their normal lives.\"",
      "In terms of why some people are triggered, Dr Gregory says it might be a heightened basic survival instinct - like a meerkat on the lookout for danger.",
      "She likens the feeling to seeing \"someone scurrying in the distance\" or \"tuning into footsteps behind you\".",
      "\"For some people, you don't tune it out again. Your brain is continually monitoring.\"",
      "In noisy, hectic modern life, it's not very useful, she says.",
      "And if you keep getting triggered, the frustration and anger can build.",
      "For some people, it's strangers' habits that are most irksome, while for others, it's loved ones.",
      "One common way people try to manage the condition is by avoiding looking at fidgeting or by distracting themselves, Dr Gregory says.",
      "Others may try to avoid people entirely, as much as they can.",
      "If there is only one isolated visual trigger - such as hair twirling - the expert says it is sometimes possible to use reframing therapy to help the person view the situation in a more positive way.",
      "\"You might look at it deliberately and create a new backstory for why someone is doing that movement.\"",
      "That can help reduce the anger and anxiety, she says.",
      "\"A lot of people feel really embarrased or ashamed that they get such strong reactions,\" Dr Gregory adds.",
      "\"That, itself, can be a problem because suppressing your emotions can intensify them and make them worse.\""

    "story": [
      "Medically-assisted dying \u2013 also known as voluntary euthanasia \u2013 accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023, new government data shows.",
      "The country's fifth annual report since euthanasia was legalised in 2016 showed around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year after being successful in their applications.",
      "The median age of this group was more than 77. The vast majority \u2013 around 96% - had a death deemed \"reasonably foreseeable\", due to severe medical conditions such as cancer.",
      "In the small minority of other cases, patients may not have been terminally ill, but sought an assisted death due to a long and complicated illness that had significantly impacted their quality of life.",
      "Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria.",
      "In Canada, consenting adults can request medical assistance in dying from a healthcare provider if they have a serious and irremediable medical condition.",
      "Some provisions are in place, including a requirement of having two independent healthcare providers confirm that the patient is eligible before their request is approved.",
      "More than 320,000 people died in Canada in 2023, and 15,300 of those deaths - about one in 20 - were medically assisted.",
      "The figures released on Wednesday by Health Canada show that the rate of assisted dying in Canada increased by nearly 16% in 2023. This number is a sharp drop from the average increase of 31% in previous years.",
      "The report cautioned that it is too early to determine what caused the rate to slacken.",
      "For the first time, the report delved into race and ethnic data of those who died by euthanasia.",
      "Around 96% of recipients identified as white people, who account for about 70% of Canada's population. It is unclear what caused this disparity.",
      "The second most reported ethnic group was east Asians (1.8%), who account for about 5.7% of Canadians.",
      "Assisted dying continued to have the highest usage rate in Quebec, which accounted for nearly 37% of all euthanasia deaths, despite the province holding just 22% of Canada's population.",
      "Quebec's government launched a study earlier this year to examine why its euthanasia rate was so high.",
      "While the number of assisted deaths in Canada is growing, the country still falls behind the Netherlands, where euthanasia accounted for around 5% of total deaths last year.",
      "UK MPs voted late last month to pass a similar bill that gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death, though it will face months of further scrutiny before it could become law.",
      "As British MPs debated the legislation, Canada was cited by some as a cautionary tale due to its perceived lack of safeguards.",
      "Like the UK, Canada initially only legalised assisted dying for those whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\".",
      "However, Canada expanded access in 2021 to people who may not have a terminal diagnosis, but want to end their life because of a chronic, debilitating condition.",
      "It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year.",
      "But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.",
      "On Wednesday, Health Canada defended the procedure, saying that the criminal code sets out \"strict eligibility\" criteria.",
      "But Cardus, a Christian think tank, said the latest figures were \"alarming\" and showed Canada has one of the fastest growing euthanasia programmes in the world.",
      "A report released in October by Ontario - Canada's most populous province - has since shed some light on controversial cases where people were granted assisted dying when they were not nearing their natural death.",
      "One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.",
      "Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.",
      "Another case made headlines in recent months of a Nova Scotia cancer patient who said she was asked if she was aware of assisted dying as an option twice as she underwent mastectomy surgeries.",
      "The question \"came up in completely inappropriate places\", she told the National Post.",
      "Canadian news outlets have also reported on cases where people with disabilities have considered assisted dying due to lack of housing or disability benefits.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "A leading charity that supports people with learning disabilities says it may be forced to stop running at least 60 of its services as a result of increasing National Insurance costs.",
      "Mencap is one of a growing number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services because of the impact of the Budget.",
      "Businesses - including charities - currently pay a rate of 13.8% National Insurance on employees' earnings above \u00a39,100 a year. But that will increase to 15% in April 2025, instead starting when wages reach \u00a35,000.",
      "Mencap says the rise will cost it \u00a35.3m every year.",
      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",
      "Local authorities, who pay for most social care for older and disabled people, say the rising costs for the sector are \"insurmountable\".",
      "The government says it is tackling the challenges facing adult social care, as well as providing it with extra money as part of \u00a33.5bn in additional funding for councils in England next year.",
      "Round-the-clock support",
      "Twenty-six people with a range of learning disabilities live at Churchfields, in Essex. It is one of 600 services run by Mencap across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",
      "But with both, their faces and reactions can tell their story more eloquently than words.",
      "Their faces light up when they see each other. Betty lifts Barry's hand to kiss it and they both smile and laugh. An engagement ring glimmers on Betty's left hand \u2013 staff helped Barry propose to her.",
      "Teeto Adegbenro, who is one of Barry's care workers, is passionate about his work.",
      "\"The quality of life you give to these people is the experience they have in their life,\" he says.",
      "It takes 50 staff to support the people at Churchfields to live full lives. Mencap employs about 7,500 staff across all its services. Many care workers are on low pay.",
      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",
      "But if the charity increases everyone's salary to maintain pay differences that reflect levels of experience and responsibility, then it says the annual additional costs could rise to \u00a318m.",
      "Mencap's chief executive, Jon Sparkes, told the BBC it may have to stop running at least 60 services.",
      "\"They are services that provide basic daily social care, support for 200 people with a learning disability, and services that employ about 400 people,\" he says. \"Those are the services I'm worried about immediately.\"",
      "He warned: \"It could be more.\"",
      "Local authorities pay the charity to support people with learning disabilities, so in practice it would be handing contracts back to councils.",
      "Mr Sparkes says unless there is a substantial increase in fees they will have to tell councils \"we can't afford to run this service safely on the funding that we're getting\".",
      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",
      "Dr Jane Townson, of the Homecare Association, representing providers who support people in their own homes, is worried there is a real risk of a \"significant reduction in care and support services\".",
      "She fears that will leave some people without essential services, and increase the pressure on families and the NHS.",
      "\"We are at a tipping point and need immediate government intervention,\" she says.",
      "Most social care in England is funded by councils. Care providers estimate that just to cover the increased costs of the national minimum wage and NICs fees for their services would need to increase by 9-10% next year.",
      "But local authorities are also under huge financial pressure. Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), represents the people who run council social care.",
      "She says local authorities are already struggling financially, facing inflationary costs and increasing demand from people who need more complex care.",
      "\"The costs are insurmountable,\" she says. \"Many of us have overspends in adult social services. It just feels that we're in an impossible situation.\"",
      "ADASS calculates that an additional \u00a31.8bn is needed for care services in England \"just to stand still\".",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 19:14:10 GMT",
    "summary": "A new DNA analysis has shown that the arrival of modern humans from Africa was far from smooth.",
    "story": [
      "Far from triumphantly breezing out of Africa, modern humans went extinct many times before going on to populate the world, new studies have revealed.",
      "The new DNA research has also shed new light on the role our Neanderthal cousins played in our success.",
      "While these early European humans were long seen as a species which we successfully dominated after leaving Africa, new studies show that only humans who interbred with Neanderthals went on to thrive, while other bloodlines died out.",
      "In fact, Neanderthal genes may have been crucial to our success by protecting us from new diseases we hadn't previously encountered.",
      "The research for the first time pinpoints a short period 48,000 years ago when Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, after which  they went on to expand into the wider world.",
      "Homo sapiens had crossed over from the African continent before this, but the new research shows these populations before the interbreeding period did not survive.",
      "Prof Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Germany, told BBC News that the history of modern humans will now have to be rewritten.",
      "\"We see modern humans as a big story of success, coming out of Africa 60,000 years ago and expanding into all ecosystems to become the most successful mammal on the planet,\" he said. \"But early on we were not, we went extinct multiple times.\"",
      "For a long time, deciphering how the only surviving species of humans evolved was based on looking at the shapes of fossilised remains of our ancestors living hundreds of thousands of years ago and observing how their anatomy subtly changed over time.",
      "The ancient remains have been sparse and often damaged. But the ability to extract and read the genetic code from bones that are many thousands of years old has lifted a veil on our mysterious past.",
      "The DNA in the fossils tell the story of the individuals, how they are related to each other and their migration patterns.",
      "Even after our successful interbreeding with Neanderthals, our population of Europe wasn't without hitches.",
      "Those first modern humans that had interbred with Neanderthals and lived alongside them died out completely in Europe 40,000 years ago - but not before their offspring had spread further out into the world.",
      "It was the ancestors of these early international pioneers who eventually returned to Europe to populate it.",
      "The research also gives a new perspective on why Neanderthals died out so soon after modern humans arrived from Africa. No one knows why this happened, but the new evidence steers us away from theories that our species hunted them out of existence, or that we were somehow physically or intellectually superior.",
      "Instead, Prof Krause says that it supports the view that it was due to environmental factors.",
      "\"Both humans and Neanderthals go extinct in Europe at this time,\" he said. \"If we as a successful species died out in the region then it is not a big surprise that Neanderthals, who had an even smaller population went extinct.\"",
      "The climate was incredibly unstable at the time. It could switch from nearly as warm as it is today to being bitterly cold, sometimes within a person's lifetime, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, who is independent of the new research.",
      "\"The study shows that near the end of their time on the planet, Neanderthals were very low in numbers, less genetically diverse than the modern human counterparts they lived alongside, and it may not have taken much to tip them over the edge to extinction,\" he said.",
      "A separate DNA study, published in the journal Science, shows that modern humans held on to some key genetic traits from Neanderthals that may have given them an evolutionary advantage.",
      "One relates to their immune system. When humans emerged from Africa, they were extremely susceptible to new diseases they had never encountered. Interbreeding with Neanderthals gave their offspring protection.",
      "\"Perhaps getting Neanderthal DNA was part of the success because it gave us better adaptive capabilities outside of Africa,\" said Prof Stringer. \"We had evolved in Africa, whereas the Neanderthals had evolved outside of Africa.\"",
      "\"By interbreeding with the Neanderthals we got a quick fix to our immune systems.\"",

      "The star clusters are of different colours because they are at different stages in their formation, according to Dr Mowla.",
      "\u201cIt is so beautiful because the early life of a galaxy is extremely active,\" she said.",
      "\"There is so much happening, there are new stars being born, there are massive stars dying, there is a lot of gas and dust around it and there is nitrogen and oxygen and because of the state they are in, you have these lovely colours.",
      "\u201cWe are able to tell something about the ages of each cluster, the composition of their elements and the temperatures at which they formed.\u201d",
      "When Dr Mowla came across the galaxy, she had never seen clumps of stars in such vivid and varying colours. It led her to believe that there was something different about this system, so she checked how far away it was.",
      "To her surprise it turned out to be more than 13 billion light years away.",
      "The light from Firefly Sparkle is from not long after the creation of the Universe and so has taken more than 13 billion years to reach us. It is so small and so far away that not even JWST would have been able to see it, were it not for an extremely lucky cosmic coincidence.",
      "There was a cluster of galaxies exactly between Firefly Sparkle and the JWST, which distorted spacetime to stretch the light from the faraway galaxy and effectively act as a gigantic magnifying glass.",
      "Astronomers call this process gravitational lensing, which in this instance enabled the research co-lead Dr Kartheik Iyer of Columbia University in New York, and other members of the team, to see for the first time, incredible details of how the first galaxies like our own Milky Way formed.",
      "\u201cIt takes the light coming from the firefly and bends it and amplifies it so we can see it in glorious detail,\u201d he told BBC News.",
      "\"Our reconstruction shows that clumps of actively forming stars are surrounded by diffuse light from other stars. This galaxy is literally in the process of assembling.\"",
      "\"When it does all this and we are able to see this incredible faraway galaxy, it is a very humbling, magical feeling.\u201d",

      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",
      "Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.",
      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",

      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",

      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",

      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",

      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The news is moving so quickly in South Korea, the papers can no longer keep up. President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock attempt to impose martial law last Tuesday night was so short-lived it failed to make the front page. By the time he despatched the troops, the press had already gone to print. By the following day's editions, the failed power-grab had already been defeated.",
      "Within the week, the president has morphed from being contrite and apologetic, hoping to avoid impeachment, to brazenly defiant, vowing to fight on as the net closed in on him.",
      "Banned from leaving the country while he is investigated for treason - a crime punishable by death - he is facing a second impeachment vote this weekend, as support from his party trickles away. Meanwhile, the roars of anger from the thousands of people on the street every night are getting louder.",
      "For a short while this week it looked as if he had struck a deal with his party to stand down early, in return for them not booting him out of office in last Saturday's vote. But as the week sped by, there was no sign of the president nor the details of such plan, and it gradually became obvious Yoon had zero intention of resigning.",
      "On Thursday, he emerged obstinate. \"I will fight until the end,\" he declared, as he defended his decision to seize control of the country.",
      "His speech was rambling and filled with unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, including a vague suggestion that North Korea could have rigged the previous elections, in which he had failed to win control of parliament. The parliament was a \"monster\", he said; the opposition party \"dangerous\", and he, by declaring martial law, was trying to protect the people and save democracy.",
      "Yoon spent much of this week in hiding, while police attempted to raid his offices to gather evidence. To try and temper public anger, his party announced that he would not be allowed to make decisions going forward \u2013 even though legal experts agreed there was nothing in the constitution that allowed for this.",
      "This has left everyone with the same, pressing question - who IS running the country? - especially as senior commanders of Yoon's army have said they would defy his orders if he tried to impose martial law again.",
      "There is now an unnerving power vacuum in a country that lives with the continuous threat of being attacked by North Korea. \"There is no legal basis for this arrangement. We are in a dangerous and chaotic situation,\" said Lim Ji-bong, a law professor at Sogang University.",
      "It was evident to all those on the outside that this destabilising and bizarre situation could not be allowed to continue much longer. But it took the president's party, the People Power Party (PPP), some time to realise Yoon's impeachment was unavoidable.",
      "Initially his party members protected him, eager to save their own political skins, and consumed by their hatred of South Korea's opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, who they fear will become president if Yoon is removed. But on Thursday, after stalling for days, the PPP leader, Han Dong-hoon, came out to urge all MPs to impeach him. \"The president must be suspended from office immediately,\" he said.",
      "For the impeachment to pass, two-thirds of parliament must vote in favour, meaning eight ruling party MPs must join the opposition. A handful have so far declared their intention to do so. One of the first to change his mind was Kim Sang-wook. \"The president is no longer qualified to lead the country, he is totally unfit,\" he told the BBC from his office at the National Assembly.",
      "But Kim said not all MPs would follow his lead; there is a core that will stay loyal to Yoon. In his very conservative constituency, Kim said he had received death threats for switching sides. \"My party and supporters have called me a traitor,\" he said, labelling South Korean politics as \"intensely tribal\".",
      "The vast majority of anger, however, has been directed at the MPs who have shielded Yoon up to this point.",
      "At a protest on Wednesday night the chants had changed from merely \"impeach Yoon\" to \"impeach Yoon, dissolve the party\".",
      "\"I hate them both so much right now, but I think I hate the MPs even more than the president,\" said a 31-year-old graduate student Chang Yo-hoon, who had joined tens of thousands of others, in freezing temperatures, to voice his disillusionment.",
      "All week, lawmakers have been bombarded with thousands of abusive messages and phone calls from the public, in what one member of parliament described to me as \"phone terrorism\", while some have been sent funeral flowers.",
      "Even if enough MPs vote to impeach Yoon this weekend, his party, now divided and widely detested, faces political oblivion. \"We don't even know who we are or what we stand for anymore,\" one exasperated party official told me.",
      "The defecting lawmaker Kim Sang-wook thinks it will take time to regain voters' trust. \"We will not disappear, but we need to rebuild ourselves from scratch,\" he said. \"There is a saying that South Korea's economy and culture are first class, but its politics are third class. Now is the chance to reflect on that.\"",
      "Yoon has dealt a severe blow to South Korea's reputation as a well-established, albeit young, democracy. There was pride when MPs swiftly overturned the president's martial law decision, that the country's democratic institutions were functioning after all. But the fragility of the system was exposed again, as the party manoeuvred to keep him in office, with the opposition branding this a \"second coup\".",
      "But Professor Yun Jeong-in, a research professor at Korea University's Legal Research Institute, insisted the country was dealing with \"an aberration, not a systemic failure of democracy\", pointing to the mass protests every night. \"People are not panicking; they are fighting back. They see democracy as something that is rightfully theirs,\" she said.",
      "Damage has also been done to South Korea's international relationships, and ironically to much of what Yoon wanted to achieve. He had a vison that South Korea would become a \"global pivotal state\", playing a bigger role on the world stage. He even hoped to earn Seoul an invitation to join the elite group of G7 countries.",
      "A Western diplomat told me they were hoping for a \"swift resolution\" to the crisis. \"We need South Korea to be a stable partner. Impeachment would be a step in the right direction.\"",
      "If Yoon is suspended from office on Saturday, he will not leave without a fight. A prosecutor by trade, who knows the law inside out, he has decided he would rather be impeached, and challenge the decision when it goes to court, than go quietly. And the shockwaves he has set off are going to ripple through the country for years, perhaps decades, to follow.",

    "story": [
      "The end, when it came for the BGP5 barracks, was loud and brutal. First, a crackly speaker calling out for their surrender; then, a thunderous barrage of artillery, rockets and rifle fire that tore chunks out of the buildings in which hundreds of soldiers were hiding.",
      "BGP5 \u2013 the letters stand for Border Guard Police \u2013 was the Myanmar military junta's last stand in northern Rakhine State, which lies along the border with Bangladesh.",
      "Video by the insurgent Arakan Army (AA) which was besieging the base shows their rag-tag fighters, many barefoot, firing an assortment of weapons into the base, while air force jets roar over their heads.",
      "It was a ferocious battle - perhaps the bloodiest of the civil war which has consumed Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in 2021.",
      "\"They had dug deep ditches filled with spikes around the base,\" an AA source told the BBC.",
      "\"There were bunkers and reinforced buildings. They laid more than a thousand mines. Many of our fighters lost limbs, or their lives, trying to get through.\"",
      "For the coup leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, this has been yet another humiliating defeat after a year of military setbacks.",
      "For the first time his regime has lost control of an entire border: the 270km (170 miles) dividing Myanmar from Bangladesh now wholly under AA control.",
      "And with only the Rakhine State capital Sittwe still firmly in military hands, though cut off from the rest of the country, the AA is likely to be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state.",
      "'My 17-year-old was brutally killed, but I'm glad she fought for freedom'Young people attempt to flee Myanmar ahead of conscription order",
      "'My 17-year-old was brutally killed, but I'm glad she fought for freedom'",
      "Young people attempt to flee Myanmar ahead of conscription order",
      "The army has been in headlong retreat from the Arakan Army since the beginning of the year, losing town after town.",
      "The last army units withdrew in September to BGP5, a compound covering around 20 hectares just outside the border town of Maungdaw, where the AA laid siege.",
      "BGP5 was built on the site of a Muslim Rohingya village, Myo Thu Gyi, which was burned down during the violent expulsion of much of the Rohingya population by the armed forces in 2017.",
      "It was the first of many burned villages I saw on a visit to Maungdaw right after the military operation in September of that year, a mass of charred debris in among the lush tropical vegetation, its inhabitants killed or forced to flee to Bangladesh.",
      "When I returned two years later, the new police complex had already been built, with all the trees removed, giving defenders a clear view of any attacking force.",
      "The AA source told us their advance towards it was painfully slow, requiring the insurgents to dig their own ditches for cover.",
      "It does not publish its own casualties. But judging from the intensity of fighting in Maungdaw, which began in June, it is likely to have lost hundreds of its own troops.",
      "Throughout the siege, the Myanmar air force kept up a constant bombardment of Maungdaw, driving the last civilians out of the town.",
      "Its planes dropped supplies to the besieged soldiers at night, but it was never enough. They had plenty of rice stored in the bunkers, a local source told us, but they could not get any treatment for their injuries, and the soldiers became demoralised.",
      "They started to surrender last weekend.",
      "AA video shows them coming out in a pitiful state, waving white cloths. Some are hobbling on makeshift crutches, or hopping, their injured legs wrapped in rags. Few are wearing shoes.",
      "Inside the wrecked buildings the victorious insurgents filmed piles of bodies.",
      "The AA says more than 450 soldiers died in the siege. It has published images of the captured commander, Brigadier-General Thurein Tun, and his officers kneeling beneath the flagpole, now flying the insurgents' banner.",
      "Pro-military commentators in Myanmar have been venting their frustration on social media.",
      "\"Min Aung Hlaing, you have not asked any of your children to serve in the military,\" wrote one. \"Is this how you use us? Are you happy seeing all those deaths in Rakhine?\"",
      "\"At this rate, all that will be left of the Tatmadaw [military] will be Min Aung Hlaing and a flagpole,\" wrote another.",
      "The capture of BGP5 also shows the Arakan Army to be one of the most effective fighting forces in Myanmar.",
      "Formed only in 2009 \u2013 much later than most of Myanmar's other insurgent groups \u2013 by young ethnic Rakhine men who had migrated to the Chinese border on the other side of the country in search of work, the AA is part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance which has inflicted most of the defeats suffered by the junta since last year.",
      "The other two members of the alliance have stayed on the border, in Shan State.",
      "But the AA moved back to Rakhine eight years ago to start its armed campaign for self-government, tapping into historic resentment among the Rakhine population of the poverty, isolation and central government neglect of their state.",
      "The AA leaders have proven to be smart, disciplined and able to motivate their fighters.",
      "They are already administering the large areas of Rakhine State they control as though they were running their own state.",
      "And they also have good weapons, thanks to their links with the older insurgent groups on the Chinese border, and appear to be well-funded.",
      "There is a bigger question, though, over how much the various ethnic insurgent groups are willing to prioritise the goal of overthrowing the military junta.",
      "Publicly they say they do, alongside the shadow government which was deposed by the coup, and the hundreds of volunteer peoples' defence forces which have sprung up to support it.",
      "In return for the support it is getting from the ethnic insurgents, the shadow government is promising a new federal political system which will give Myanmar's regions self-rule.",
      "But already the other two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance have accepted China's request for a ceasefire.",
      "China is seeking a negotiated end to the civil war which would almost certainly leave the military with much of its power intact.",
      "The opposition insists the military must be reformed and removed from politics. But having already made so many territorial gains at the expense of the junta, the ethnic insurgents may be tempted to strike a deal with China's blessing rather than keep fighting to oust the generals.",
      "The AA's victory poses more worrying questions.",
      "The group's leadership is tight-lipped about its plans. But it takes over a state that was always poor and which has suffered greatly from the intense fighting of the past year.",
      "\"Eighty per cent of the housing in Maungdaw and the surrounding villages has been destroyed,\" one Rohingya man who left Maungdaw recently for Bangladesh told the BBC.",
      "\"The town is deserted. Almost all the shops and houses have been looted.\"",
      "Last month the United Nations, whose agencies are being given very little access to Rakhine, warned of looming famine, because of the huge numbers of displaced people and the difficulty of getting any supplies in, past a military blockade.",
      "The AA is trying to set up its own administration, but the BBC has been told by some of those displaced by the fighting that the group cannot feed or shelter them.",
      "It is also unclear how the AA will treat the Rohingya population, still thought to number around 600,000 in Rakhine, even after the expulsion of 700,000 in 2017.",
      "The largest number live in northern Rakhine State and Maungdaw has long been a predominantly Rohingya town. Relations with the ethnic Rakhine majority, the support base for the AA, have long been fraught.",
      "They are now a great deal worse after Rohingya militant groups, which have their power base in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh, chose to take sides with the military, against the AA, despite the army's track record of persecuting Rohingyas.",
      "Many Rohingyas do not like these groups, and some say they are happy to live in an AA-run Rakhine State.",
      "But tens of thousands have been expelled by the AA from towns it has conquered, and not been allowed back.",
      "The AA has promised to include all communities in its vision for a future independent of the central government, but it has also denounced the Rohingyas it found itself fighting alongside the army. In August dozens of Rohingyas, many of them women and children trying to cross over to Bangladesh, were killed by bombs, almost certainly dropped from AA drones.",
      "\"We cannot deny the fact that Rohingyas have been persecuted by Myanmar governments for many years, and the Rakhine people supported that,\" said the Rohingya man we spoke to in Bangladesh.",
      "\"The government wants to keep Rohingyas from becoming citizens, but the Rakhine people believe there should be no Rohingyas at all in Rakhine State. Our situation today is even more difficult than it was under the rule of the military junta.\"",

    "story": [
      "Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju shocked the world of chess on Thursday when he became the youngest world champion at the age of just 18.",
      "The Chennai-born prodigy defeated defending champion, China's Ding Liren, in a dramatic match staged in Singapore which he had entered as the challenger. The FIDE World Chess Championship carries a $2.5m (\u00a31.96m) prize fund.",
      "It marked the peak to date of his career,  his greatest moment in a long string of achievements.",
      "Gukesh became a grandmaster aged 12 years and seven months and even then, he was upfront about the fact that he dreamt of being the world champion.",
      "In fact, he said he had harboured such ambitions since he was seven when he was a spectator at a World Title match between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen in 2013.",
      "As he confessed at the press conference following his dramatic win against Ding, he just didn't think it would happen so soon.",
      "\"Throughout the match I had several chances to clinch victories and many of the games which would have put me in the front foot quite seriously. But once I was getting close I was getting nervous and I was not able to finish him off,\" Gukesh told the BBC after the win.",
      "\"...And then all of a sudden...it was a sudden change and I could not process all the new information so quickly.\"",
      "Gukesh is the 18th world champion since Wilhelm Steinitz won what is considered the first title match way back in 1886.",
      "Born in May 2006, Gukesh is also, by far, the youngest player to have ascended this pinnacle.",
      "He comfortably improved upon the prior record held by Garry Kasparov (born April 1963) who was 22 when he won the title in Moscow in November 1985 by beating Anatoly Karpov.",
      "The 14-game match was tied with two wins each after 13 games. It looked as though the 14th game was heading for a draw.",
      "In that case, there would have been tiebreaks played at progressively shorter time controls.",
      "But Ding blundered on move 55 and Gukesh exploited the error to clinch the title.",
      "Over the last three years the young player has made a string of extraordinary achievements, culminating in this victory.",
      "Gukesh won the individual gold medal for best performance in the last two Olympiads. He led India to a team bronze at Chennai in 2022 and the gold medal in 2024 in Budapest.",
      "He also won the Candidates - the tournament that earned him the right to challenge Ding Liren.",
      "Earlier in his teens, Gukesh was ruled out as a prospective challenger by his mentor, the former world champion Viswanathan Anand, or \"Vishy Sir\" as Gukesh calls him. He thought Gukesh simply didn't have enough experience.",
      "Indeed, Gukesh suffered an apparently catastrophic loss at the midway stage, but then he pulled himself together to win in the  next round and eventually took the event.",
      "In the title match Gukesh lost the first game, and equalised with a win in game three, he then took the lead in game eleven and Ding equalised with a win in game 12.",
      "Game 14 was obviously high-tension with the title and a prize fund of $2.5m (\u00a31.98m) at stake, but the teenager controlled his nerves.",
      "Gukesh is obviously an extraordinary talent but this is not the romantic story of a lone ranger surprising the world. The Chennai GM is at the apex of a robust chess ecosystem, which is one of the best, perhaps the best, in the world.",
      "Gukesh has also been strongly supported by his parents, by the chess establishment in India, and by his school.",
      "India has over 85 grandmasters, many of whom are not yet of driving age.",
      "Indian teams have succeeded recently, winning both the Open Gold (with Gukesh on top board) and the Women's gold at the last Olympiad in Budapest.",
      "Those grandmasters are at the tip of a pyramid with over 30,000 rated players, because a huge number of Indians play officially sanctioned tournaments.",
      "Gukesh has been a professional player since he was around 10 years old. He is mentored by Viswanathan Anand, who is himself a five-time world champion.",
      "He is sponsored by Westbridge Capital, which supports the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy, a premier coaching centre run by Anand.",
      "Gukesh's parents are both doctors, his father Rajinikanth is a surgeon and mother Padma is a microbiologist. Both put their careers on hold to push their son.",
      "\"Initially I just used to watch my family members play chess at home, just as a hobby, just like any other board game. But then I got interested in the game and I happened to enrol in a chess summer camp in my school\u2026 there one of the coaches spotted I had good talent for that,\" Gukesh told the BBC.",
      "Chess becomes an expensive game when a child has to travel abroad for several months of every year, so his parents not only put their own earnings into supporting their son, they also asked friends to help crowd-fund Gukesh's career until it took off.",
      "Importantly, he also received support from his school, Velammal Vidyalaya in Mogappair, which allowed him to take leave.",
      "Gukesh has interests outside of chess too - he meditates, swims and plays tennis.",
      "His stated goals are simple - he wants to be the best chess player in the World \u2013 supplanting the current number one, Magnus Carlsen.",
      "He also wants to have a \"very long career at the top\". As he sees it, the title is only one step, albeit a very important one in that life journey.",

    "story": [
      "Russian naval vessels appear to have temporarily left their main port in Syria, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show, amid continuing uncertainty about Moscow's military future in the country after the fall of its ally, Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Images taken by Maxar on 10 December show some ships have left Tartous naval base since Sunday and are currently sitting offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Meanwhile, other photos taken on the same day show activity continuing at Russia's main airbase in Syria, Hmeimim, with jets clearly visible on the tarmac.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia's future military presence.",
      "\"Everything possible is now being done to get in touch with those involved in ensuring security and, of course, our military is also taking all the necessary precautions,\" he told reporters in Moscow.",
      "He previously warned that it was \"premature\" to speculate on the bases' future.",
      "\"You know that, of course, we maintain contacts with those who control the situation in Syria now. This is necessary because we have our bases there and our diplomatic office [embassy]. And of course, ensuring the safety and security of our facilities are of utmost importance,\" he told reporters.",
      "The Tartous naval facility houses elements of the Black Sea Fleet and is Russia's only repair and replenishment hub in the Mediterranean. Established by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it was expanded and modernised by Russia in 2012 as the Kremlin began to increase its support for President Assad's regime.",
      "It allows Russian vessels to remain in the Mediterranean without having to return to ports in the Black Sea via the Turkish Straits. It is also a deep-water port, meaning it can host submarines from Moscow's nuclear fleet, according to the US Naval Institute.",
      "The new satellite images show Moscow has at least temporarily brought its ships out of the port, with two guided missile frigates moored about 13km (eight miles) off the Syrian coast. It is unclear where the remainder of the fleet - pictured in earlier images - currently is.",
      "It is also unclear whether their departure is part of a permanent withdrawal from Tartous. In recent weeks, satellite images have repeatedly shown naval vessels coming and going from the port.",
      "Mike Plunkett from the open-source defence intelligence analysts at Janes organisation noted that the Russian movements appeared to have been \"conducted to ensure that their ships are not vulnerable to attack\".",
      "\"Whether they are worried about attack from the Syrian rebels or collateral damage from any Israeli strike on Syrian assets in Tartus is unknown,\" he added.",
      "Frederik Van Lokeren, a former Belgian navy lieutenant and analyst, told BBC Verify that it appeared the Russian vessels were now in a holding pattern while Moscow deliberated on its next move.",
      "\"They're effectively in limbo at the moment, because they don't quite know what's going to happen,\" Mr Van Lokeren said.",
      "\"Obviously, since they're lingering there, it seems that Russia is not willing to withdraw all its naval vessels out of the area just yet, which might be an indication that they're negotiating with regional partners to see where they can redeploy these vessels.\"",
      "Analysts have speculated that if Russia is forced to close the Tartous naval facility, it could redeploy its presence to Tobruk in Libya. The region is controlled by the Kremlin-backed Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and already hosts some Russian airbases.",
      "But withdrawing from Tartous would be immensely costly, and Mr Van Lokeren noted that the move would also bring Russian vessels closer to Nato bases, making them easier to track. For now, he said, there is no indication that Russia is moving the necessary naval assets to remove equipment from Tartous.",

      "Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify showed at least two large jets - identified by Janes as IL-76 transport aircraft - still sitting on the tarmac at the base on 10 December. Helicopters could also be seen at the base in the images.",
      "Janes also notes that air defence systems deployed at the site remain visible in the north-western corner of the image.",
      "Dara Massicot, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said on X on Sunday that an evacuation of the airbase would involve a massive airlift requiring far more jets than those visible in the satellite images, suggesting that Moscow does not plan to evacuate imminently.",

      "The overthrow followed a 13-year civil war, which started after Assad crushed pro-democracy protests. The fighting killed more than half a million people, displaced millions more, and embroiled international powers and their proxies.",
      "The world is now watching to see how Syria's political landscape shapes up after the end of the Assad family's half-century rule.",
      "Those with a vested interest in the conflict and the future of the country include, on one side, Russia and Iran - which backed Assad - and on the other, the US and Turkey, which supported different rebel groups and militias.",
      "Here we explore how those countries, along with Israel, have played a role in Syria - and could continue to do so.",
      "Turkey",
      "During Syria's civil war, Turkey has supported rebel factions - most of which now fight under the banner of the Syrian National Army (SNA) - by providing arms, military and political support.",
      "Syria's northern neighbour has mostly been concerned with using rebels to contain the Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey accuses of being an extension of a domestically banned Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. Turkey also wants the roughly three million Syrian refugees living in its country to return home.",
      "The YPG is the biggest militia in the US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance, which controls much of the north-east of the country.",
      "The SDF largely avoided conflict with Assad's forces during the war. However, Turkish troops and allied rebels seized stretches of territory from the YPG and SDF along Syria's northern border.",
      "Turkey has also been politically involved. In 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib, the rebels' stronghold in the north-west.",
      "Idlib was dominated by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the rebels who eventually overthrew Assad.",
      "Many believe the offensive could not have happened without Turkey's blessing. Turkey has denied backing HTS.",
      "Meanwhile, conflict in Syria's north continues: At the same time as HTS launched its offensive, the SNA launched a separate assault on areas held by the SDF.",
      "Russia",
      "Russia already had a decades-long relationship with the Assad government, and had military bases there before the civil war.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin used his country's presence in Syria, and support of Assad, to challenge the power and dominance of the West in the region.",
      "In 2015, Russia launched an air campaign and sent thousands of troops in support of the Assad regime.",
      "In return, Russia received 49-year leases on an air base and naval base, which provided crucial hubs in the eastern Mediterranean for transferring military contractors in and out of Africa.",
      "This marked an important stage in Russia's attempt to assert itself as a global power, previously focusing its efforts on nations that were once in the Soviet bloc.",

      "A US-led global coalition carried out air strikes and deployed special forces to help the Kurdish-led SDF alliance capture territory once held by IS in the north-east.",
      "After the Assad government fell, the US government said it conducted dozens of air strikes against IS camps and operatives in central Syria to ensure IS could not take advantage of the unstable situation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office in January, said Syria is a \"mess\" the US should stay out of. When Trump was president in 2019, he ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, a move his officials gradually rowed back.",

      "Thousands of Shia Muslim fighters armed, trained and financed by Iran - mostly from the Lebanon-based Hezbollah movement, but also from Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen - have also fought alongside the Syrian army.",
      "But similar to Russia with Ukraine, Hezbollah was weakened by conflict with Israel in Lebanon, likely hastening the downfall of the Syrian military.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 09:40:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Queensland's new laws will see children found guilty of serious crimes given harsher penalties.",
    "story": [
      "The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.",
      "The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to \"community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders\" and will act as a deterrent.",
      "But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.",
      "The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.",
      "The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the \"rights of victims\" ahead of \"the rights of criminals\".",
      "\"These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state,\" Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday.",
      "Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue.",
      "But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since.",
      "Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend.",
      "Dubbed by the government as \"adult crime, adult time\", the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years.",
      "Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was \"particularly heinous\".",
      "The laws also remove \"detention as a last resort\" provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a child's full criminal history when sentencing.",
      "The Queensland Police Union has called the changes  \"a leap forward in the right direction\", while Queensland's new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to \"better address patterns of offending\" and \"hold people accountable for their actions\".",
      "But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full.",
      "Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory.",
      "Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be \"pressure in the short-term\" his government had a long-term plan to \"deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options\".",
      "Australia's commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an \"international embarrassment\".",
      "She also accused Queensland's government of \"ignoring evidence\" which suggests \"the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes\".",
      "\"The fact that [the bill's] provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.",

      "Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria.",

      "It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year.",
      "But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.",

      "One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.",
      "Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.",

    "story": [
      "Forensic and ballistic evidence that police say ties the accused murderer of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson to the crime scene will make it difficult for his lawyers to mount a defence, former prosecutors and other legal experts say.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday after a days-long, multi-state manhunt ended at a McDonalds in the town of Altoona.",
      "New York authorities say fingerprints and shell casings link him to the crime scene.",
      "His lawyer, Thomas Dickey, earlier told local media he had not \"seen any evidence yet\" implicating his client.",
      "He said Mr Mangione would plead not guilty to the charges he faces in Pennsylvania, including firearms charges.",
      "In New York, he has been charged with second-degree murder over Mr Thompson's killing and it is not clear how he would plead. He is currently being held in a state prison in Pennsylvania where he is fighting extradition to face that murder charge. The legal battle over his extradition could potentially take more than a month to resolve, officials said.",
      "But legal experts told the BBC that his efforts to contest his extradition to New York are unlikely to be successful. They could, however, provide his defence with a glimpse into the state's evidence against him.",
      "\"I don't even know if this is him,\" his lawyer, Mr Dickey, said in a recent interview with US media outlet NewsNation, referring to images of Mr Thompson's killer.",

      "\"Defence number one is 'it wasn't me' and defence number two is 'it was me, but I shouldn't be punished' because of X,\" he said.",
      "According to New York police, Mr Mangione was found with a gun similar to the murder weapon, a silencer and a fake ID, as well as three handwritten pages which they believe suggest a potential motive.",
      "Mr Epner said that the publicly known evidence so far means denying responsibility is \"out the window\".",

      "The opposition tabled another impeachment motion on Thursday, setting the stage for a vote at 17:00 local time (09:00 GMT) Saturday.",
      "If South Korea's parliament passes the impeachment bill, a trial would be held by the Constitutional Court. Two-thirds of that court would have to sustain the majority for Yoon to be removed from office permanently.",
      "Yoon has been a lame duck president since the opposition won the April general election by a landslide - his government has not been able to pass the laws it wanted and has been reduced to vetoing bills proposed by the opposition.",
      "Yoon also accused North Korea sympathisers of trying to undermine his government when he declared martial law on the night of 3 December.",
      "The announcement plunged the country into political turmoil. Protesters faced off against security forces in front of the National Assembly building while lawmakers scrambled to vote down Yoon's order.",
      "Yoon withdrew his martial law order hours after it was blocked by lawmakers.",
      "Since then, the country has remained on edge. There have been huge protests and strikes calling for Yoon's impeachment, and the presidential office was raided on Wednesday as Yoon faces multiple investigations on charges of insurrection and treason.",

      "Australia will provide A$600m (\u00a3301m, $384m) over ten years to set up the team \u2013 which will be based in Port Moresby and compete from 2028 \u2013 and help develop the game at a grassroots level across the Pacific region.",
      "In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.",
      "The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called \"Pacific family\". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region.",
      "If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team.",
      "Announcing the agreement in Sydney on Thursday, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said it was a \"monumental\" opportunity for his country, and one aimed at fostering \"unity\" - not only between the 830 language groups in PNG, but also between the nation at large and its closest neighbour.",
      "\"For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,\" he told reporters.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a \"great day\" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - \"deserves\" a spot in the league.",

      "'Unprecedented' win for sport diplomacy",
      "Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented.",
      "The country has over the past decade been \"thinking innovatively about how you can marry sport with policy to counter classical security threats\" said Dr Murray, from Bond University.",

      "Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a \"thinning\" relationship between the two countries.",
      "Marape made a point to say the agreement \"doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours\".",
      "\"We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,\" he said. \"But in security, closer to home\u2026 our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed\u2026 together.\"",
      "Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as \"an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty\".",
      "Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging \"transactional\" dynamic in Pacific relations.",
      "\"People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,\" Dr Murray said. \"For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy.\"",
      "Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.",
      "\"China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure\u2026 which is sort of what China is good at\u2026 [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,\" Mr Nobetau said.",
      "\"It's something that other countries can't do,\" Dr Murray added. \"We need to use it, especially in a very, very contested region such as the Pacific.\""

    "summary": "John Mahama was elected on his pledges to solve the economic crisis but won't find it easy, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana's former President John Mahama will be under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of voters following his landslide victory in Saturday's election.",
      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bwaumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated next month when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",
      "Mahama succinctly acknowledged this in his victory speech, saying: \"Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them.",

    "summary": "The HTS chief has evolved from jihadist leader to rebel statesman while fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.",
    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",
      "But who is Jolani - or Ahmed al-Sharaa - and why and how has he changed?",

      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

    "title": "India: Is the fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 22:14:58 GMT",
    "summary": "India's economy slumped to 5.4% , below the central bank's RBI's 7% forecast. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their global share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu, a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

    "summary": "Advocacy groups call the controversial weapon \"the fastest growing gun safety problem in the US\".",
    "story": [
      "Investigators say the black pistol allegedly recovered from Luigi Mangione, the suspect arrested in connection with the killing of a healthcare executive, appeared to be a ghost gun - a firearm that can be assembled at home.",
      "Officials said the device might have been made using a 3D printer, but would have to be tested by ballistic experts to confirm.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing has once again thrown the spotlight on this controversial weapon that has been called \"the fastest growing gun safety problem in the country\" by advocacy groups.",
      "Here's what to know about these firearms.",
      "What is a ghost gun?",
      "Ghost guns are so-called because they are potentially untraceable. They can be assembled at home, either from scratch or through weapon parts kits, and they are not marked with serial numbers.",
      "The weapon allegedly carried by Mr Mangione in his backpack seems to have been typical. The arrest warrant described it as a \"semi-automatic pistol with what appears to be a 3D-printed loaded receiver with a metal slide and silencer\".",
      "Police said it was capable of firing 9mm rounds, and was consistent with the type of weapon used in the fatal shooting of Mr Thompson in New York the week before.",
      "The Biden administration, arguing in favour of regulating the firearms, has previously described ghost guns as being \"ridiculously easy\" to put together.",
      "Until August 2023, anyone with internet access could legally buy many of the parts needed to make a gun without a background check. Online tutorials explain how to fit together the pieces into a fully functioning firearm in less than an hour.",

      "'Pretty crazy': Witness details arrest of suspect in McDonald's",
      "Supreme Court signals openness to Biden's 'ghost gun' crackdown",
      "How big a problem are they?",
      "Experts have called ghost guns the country's fastest-growing gun safety problem. They have been increasingly used in high-profile shootings.",
      "According to figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 20,000 suspected ghost guns were reported as being found by law enforcement in criminal investigations in 2022 - a tenfold increase from 2016.",
      "Authorities say that without serial numbers on their frames, it is virtually impossible to track dealers who are selling these guns illegally to minors or to people without licenses.",
      "A former government official doubted whether people's minds would be changed by Mr Thompson's killing. \"Ghost guns are a new factor in a very complicated and violent country,\" Juliette Kayyem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "America was finding it \"very hard\" to restrict the firearm, said Ms Kayyem, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "More than 48,000 people were killed by firearms generally in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Are ghost guns regulated?",
      "The killing has renewed scrutiny of ghost guns - which the Biden government has tried to regulate by saying they should be treated in the same way as commercially available firearms.",
      "Manufacturers of ghost gun kits are now required to include serial numbers on their products, and perform background checks on the purchasers.",
      "In October, the US Supreme Court signalled its willingness to uphold the law, which has been challenged by gun rights groups saying that authorities had overstepped the bounds of pre-existing legislation.",
      "A ruling that upholds the ATF's new regulation would mark a change for this Supreme Court, which has a conservative super-majority that has been largely sceptical of gun regulations.",
      "On guns more broadly, US President-elect Donald Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, which grants the right to bear arms.  Earlier this year, he told the National Rifle Association (NRA) that he was the group's best friend."

      "It is what scientists call a polymetallic nodule, created over millennia as minerals accumulate on the seabed.",
      "Packed full of cobalt, nickel and manganese, these ancient formations are now  valuable: the metals go into batteries that power modern life, from electric cars to mobile phones.",
      "They have become a source of friction in the low-lying Pacific Islands, which are among the nations most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "With rising sea levels, the ocean - or Moana, as it's called in M\u0101ori and many other Polynesian languages - remains their greatest threat, but it is also their biggest provider.",
      "They fish in it and they live off the tourists drawn to their turquoise waters, but now the Cook Islands wants to dig deeper, up to 6,000m (19,685 ft), where the nodules lie.",
      "It's a pet project for Prime Minister Mark Brown, who believes it will reshape this country of 15 volcanic islands in the southern Pacific.",
      "The hope is that the income from these metals could lead to more prosperity than the islanders had ever imagined.",
      "Except the promise of deep sea mining may carry an environmental price.",
      "Proponents say that harvesting these nodules for use in renewables will help the world transition from fossil fuels. They also believe that it is less invasive than mining on land.",
      "But critics argue so much is still unknown about the impact of extracting what is one of the last untouched parts of the planet. They say there should be a pause on deep sea mining until there is more research on its effects on marine life and the oceanic ecosystem.",
      "When Jean was growing up, she says, the nodules were only thought to be useful for making knife blades.",
      "\"We had no idea that cell phones were going to come, and wind turbines and electric cars.\"",

      "It's not an easy process \u2013 nor a cheap one. But when prices of metals like nickel soared in 2008, it looked more appealing.",
      "Then Covid hit. Tourists left and the money dried up.",
      "Together with the impact of climate change - rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns - the country quickly realised it needed something else to rely on.",
      "The Cook Islands' Seabeds Minerals Authority estimates there are 12 billion wet tonnes of polymetallic nodules in their waters.",
      "Some people argue mining the seabed is not financially viable. With technology moving so fast, these metals may not even be in demand by the time it gets going.",
      "But there are takers. And in 2022, the Cook Islands gave out three licences to companies to start exploring the possibility of deep-sea mining.",
      "They're now working with scientists in researching the environmental impact.",
      "\"Nothing we do in life is risk-free. So, if you want zero risk you need to go and sit in a little room with cotton wool around you,\" says Hans Smit, who runs Moana Minerals, one of the firms that has an exploration licence.",
      "\"We have this lifestyle, this lifestyle has a price. If we don't want mining and we don't want to get all these metals, we need to stop doing just about everything we're doing.\"",
      "Hans is from South Africa and moved here to be part of the community. To him, the deep-sea metals are an \"incredible resource\" that could benefit the islanders.",
      "While there's a growing call to delay deep-sea mining until regulations by the International Seabed Authority are drawn up, this only applies to international waters.",
      "The Cook Islands still have huge reserves of their own in their national waters - their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - so, they can crack on regardless.",
      "\"We're known as small-island developing states, but we like to call ourselves large ocean states,\" says Rima Brown, a young Cook Islander with a geography degree who jokingly calls herself the poster child for deep-sea mining.",
      "Rima works for the Seabed Minerals Authority and much of her time is spent mapping the sea bed.",

      "\"We're seeing infrastructure being put up here on Rarotonga, accommodation for offshore mining companies to reside here, we've got draft mining regulations already in place. Actions are speaking a lot louder than words at the moment.\"",
      "Prime Minister Mark Brown, who is driving this, also happens to be the tourism minister and the seabed minerals minister. He's made it clear he wants the Cook Islands to be a leader in the industry.",
      "\"It provides the opportunity for our kids to be able to study at any university in the world without having to incur a student loan,\" says Brown, who has a vision of following the lead of Norway in establishing a sovereign wealth fund.",

      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

    "summary": "Shanthi tried her best to create a sense of normality for her children on the remote British island Diego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "It's morning in a makeshift camp on the remote British island of Diego Garcia, and Shanthi's husband has just awoken to find their young children staring through a security fence.",
      "As the children watch an officer and guard dog patrol the secretive island, home to a strategic UK-US military base in the middle of the Indian Ocean, they make a stark remark: \"Even the dogs have more freedom than us.\"",
      "\"When I heard that I felt heartbroken,\" he says.",
      "It was a scene that captured their family's predicament - they were stranded on a mysterious military fortress by accident, yet had a son and daughter, aged five and nine, to raise.",
      "In an effort to find normality in the tiny camp they were housed in under constant surveillance, the family found ways to entertain themselves, to study, grow food and celebrate special occasions.",
      "Shanthi, not her real name, says they had paid $5,000 (\u00a33,900) in savings and given all of her gold jewellery to smugglers for an ambitious journey to Canada, more than 12,000 km away, with dozens of other Sri Lankan Tamils.",
      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",
      "The fishing boat they were in leaked in rough seas, prompting their rescue by the Royal Navy who took them in October 2021 to Diego Garcia - and they were placed in the fenced-off migrant camp. Shanthi remembers her son asking if they had arrived in Canada.",
      "Her young children received no formal education on the island for the first six months there so, as a trained teacher, Shanthi began giving English lessons to the children in the camp.",
      "\"We started with the basics - the alphabet, nouns, verbs, present continuous,\" she says.",
      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",
      "Shanthi brought a shell with her from Diego Garcia to remember her time there. One day, she plans to put it on a chain and wear it around her neck.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:15:43 GMT",
    "summary": "It has been a steep fall for the 25-year-old batter, once hailed as Indian cricket's 'next big thing'.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he was signed by Lucknow SuperGiants for 27 crore rupees (\u00a32.54m) at the mega auction in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",
      "It's been a mighty tumble for the 25-year-old, who not too long ago, was touted as the 'next big thing\u2019 in Indian cricket.",
      "Shaw hit the headlines in November 2013 as a 14-year-old when he smashed 546 runs for Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, a prestigious school cricket tournament. It was the highest score in the world in minor cricket then.",
      "Sachin Tendulkar, India\u2019s most celebrated cricketer, had retired only a week earlier, and Shaw earned an instant comparison with the maestro.",
      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, giving him the example of Vinod Kambli who frittered away his career for the lack of discipline,\u2019\u2019 Amre told a national daily.",
      "The IPL has revolutionised young players\u2019 lives, offering a platform for talent and livelihood. Yet, the challenges of early success, instant fame,and rapid wealth remain pressing. Rahul Dravid, drawing on his experience as U-19 and India A coach, has emphasised the need for stronger junior-level mentoring to keep players on track. Shaw\u2019s struggles underscore the importance of his insight.",
      "What the future holds for Shaw time will tell.",
      "At 25, he still has age on his side. But Indian cricket is overflowing with talent, and competition for places is intense. The path from here is all uphill.",
      "\"Some of the greatest sports stories are comeback stories, If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they\u2019d sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It\u2019ll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away,\" Former England captain Kevin Pietersen posted on X.",
      "The message to Shaw is clear. Redemption lies in his own hands.",

    "summary": "President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law announcement left many Koreans with one thought: not again.",
    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw policemen gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",
      "\"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"",

      "The freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society.",
      "In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",
      "The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture.",
      "Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",
      "\"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works\u2026 that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"",
      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",
      "Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past.",
      "\"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.",
      "But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"",
      "There is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy.",
      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",

His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve.\"",

      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",

Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

Gomez's last two Globe nominations were in the same category for \"Only Murders.\" Her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short, have received equivalent nods in the best actor category each year since the show became eligible for consideration at the awards ceremony.",
      "For best supporting actress, Gomez was nominated for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the Spanish-language musical thriller from French director Jacques Audiard about a Mexican cartel boss undergoing gender-affirming surgery. Gomez co-starred in the film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose performance also earned a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress in a motion picture.",
      "Gomez praised Salda\u00f1a in a social media post reacting to the nominations.",
      "\"I don't even know what to write.. I'm so proud of @zoesaldana and I am so grateful and honored @goldenglobes,\" she wrote in a video caption  on her Instagram Stories, which captured the moment Gomez heard her name in the category for best supporting actress in a movie.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" led Monday's Golden Globes nominations with 10 nods in total, across multiple acting categories in addition to directing, screenwriting and music. (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the titular character, was also nominated.) \"Only Murders\" is also a top competitor, with four nods tying the show in second place among TV contenders. It is tied with \"Sh\u014dgun\" and second only to \"The Bear.\"",
      "Gomez called out Gasc\u00f3n in another Instagram post, along with the French composers Cl\u00e9ment Ducol and Camille, who worked on \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and received Golden Globe nominations for best original song and score.",
      "\"@karsiagascon mi amor I am so proud and grateful to know you!\" Gomez wrote, before congratulating Audiard, Ducol and Camille.",
      "Nominating an actor in two categories for their work in multiple projects at one awards show is uncommon, but it has happened at the Golden Globes before. Over the last decade, Amy Adams, Regina King and Alicia Vikander are just some of the celebrities who have competed in dual Globes races during a single year. Among the pool of 2025 nominees, Gomez and Sebastian Stan were the only actors recognized in multiple acting categories for multiple roles.",
      "Stan, of \"Pam & Tommy\" fame, was nominated in the best actor categories for musical or comedy film as well as drama. He received the nods for his lead roles in the dark comedy \"A Different Man\" and the controversial biopic \"The Apprentice,\" where he portrayed a young Donald Trump.",

    "story": [
      "\"Not Fade Away\" closed out the Kennedy Center Honors at this year's ceremony, just as honorees The Grateful Dead had used Buddy Holly's ode to enduring love to close out hundreds of concerts over the years.",
      "The packed house Sunday night danced in the aisles to the bouncy beat after a night of honoring the Dead and other recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment: director\u00a0Francis Ford Coppola,\u00a0jazz trumpeter\u00a0Arturo Sandoval\u00a0and singer-songwriter\u00a0Bonnie Raitt.\u00a0The venerable Harlem theater\u00a0The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, also was recognized.",
      "Longtime Deadheads, including actors Miles Teller and Chloe Sevigny and talk show host David Letterman, paid tribute to the band's blend of musical experimentation, longevity and community-building. \"Their music fills the universe,\" Letterman proclaimed.",
      "The choice to honor The Apollo was an unusual one: the first time the Kennedy Center has chosen to honor a specific performance venue.",
      "\"The Apollo means so much to so many of us,\" Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said while arriving on the red carpet. Moore pointed to iconic Apollo performances from Lauryn Hill and a young Michael Jackson as treasured memories of his youth.",
      "The tribute to The Apollo highlighted the sheer diversity of art forms showcased at the 90-year-old theater. Savion Glover did a spirited tap dance routine; husband and wife duo The War and Treaty performed a medley of hits by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and comedian Dave Chappelle recounted his terrifying first Apollo performance at age 15.",
      "\"Everybody started booing. It was like I was outside my body watching,\" he said. Eventually Chappelle was rushed off the stage by the theater's infamous \"Sandman,\" but he credited the experience with helping him overcome his fear of bombing.",
      "The annual gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts always features personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "In the first of the night's tributes, Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews performed a cover of Raitt's duet with the late John Prine, \"Angel from Montgomery.\"",
      "Music star Sheryl Crow paid tribute to Raitt's trailblazing career as not just a singer or songwriter but as a widely respected blues guitarist in a male-dominated field.",
      "\"I would not be doing what I'm doing if I had not seen her perform as a 17-year-old,\" said Crow, who bought her first guitar shortly after seeing Raitt in concert.",
      "Raitt herself, on the pre-event red carpet, predicted an emotional evening.",
      "\"I've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eyeliner,\" she laughed.",
      "Coppola received a tribute filled with previous Kennedy Center honorees, including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and George Lucas. All described an iconoclastic and driven auteur who loved to nurture and support younger filmmakers.",
      "\"What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs,\" Lucas said. \"When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\"",
      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Arturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\" Garcia said. \"But now his English ... is much worse.\"",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat-out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\"",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \"If I get in trouble, I'm coming to you pal.\"",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \"The Godfather.\" But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor's help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\"Things are not looking good for February,\" Biden joked.",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received an extended standing ovation from the audience when introduced at Kennedy Center. But this could be the last honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees.

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:45:39 -0500",
    "summary": "The internationally acclaimed Netflix series \u2013 a dystopian parable about capitalism and greed \u2013 is now releasing Season 2. Hwang Dong-hyuk says the lethal competition, played with childish games, is \"getting darker, episode by episode.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",
      "So, what makes Hwang Dong-hyuk laugh? \"My friends! I love talking to my friends and having a beer.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:08:24 -0500",
    "summary": "With her album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" and her current tour (her first without brother Finneas), Billie Eilish is discovering parts of herself she didn't know were there \u2013 from finding a new voice as a songwriter, to stretching her singing after starting vocal lessons.",
    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",
      "Billie and Finneas had struggled with the song. \"We wrote, like, the first half and it was super-good,\" she said. \"And then we overthought it for, like, months and months and months.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she replied. \"Sometimes when I listen to it, I hear certain parts that I'm like, 'Oh, that was such a nightmare! That was so punishing!'\"",
      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",
      "Hear Billie Eilish's isolated vocal track for \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "For all we may think we know about Billie Eilish, the singer is just beginning to know herself.",
      "I asked, \"What's interesting to me is, you're talking now about two things: one is, you've discovered a part of your voice you didn't even know was there; and you've discovered you're more of a songwriter than you ever thought. Where does that leave you?\"",
      "\"Great question,\" Eilish said. \"We'll see. I don't know!\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",
      "\"It was too far away, I think,\" Childs said. \"Definitely looking at what my parents were doing, though, was definitely something that I was observing.\"",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School for Social Research in New York City, has a sobering perspective.",
      "\"People who are in their 40s and 50s will do worse than their parents and their grandparents,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Ghilarducci explains that those two previous generations could at least bank on government-sponsored retirement programs.",
      "\"Two generations, because people had grandparents that were living through an expansion of Social Security and Medicare,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",
      "\"Relax,\" Ghilarducci said. \"Planning for retirement is best for the daylight hours, not in the middle of the night. And when you wake up, take some action steps. Worrying is not action.\"",
      "With plenty of time to get back on her feet, Childs says that she has finally stopped worrying.",
      "\"Maybe working longer could be on the table,\" Childs said. She is also entertaining the possibility of working part time later in life.",
      "\"I think outside the box,\" she adds. \"...I don't necessarily know exactly know how I'm going to get there, but if I see something, or that's what I want, I often will find a way.\"",

The Stanley logo, a winged bear with a crown, appears on the front and bottom of the mug.",

    "summary": "Fast-food worker who provided crucial police tip is eligible for up to $60,000, but getting it will take time.",
    "story": [
      "More than 400 tips were called into the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line during the five-day search for a masked gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.",
      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after\u00a0the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money it awards individual tipsters. Similarly, the Crime Stoppers program doesn't release such details in an effort to protect tipsters' anonymity.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

    "summary": "Canada could halt oil and gas imports to the U.S. if Donald Trump imposes steep new tariffs, Ontario Premier Doug Ford warns.",
    "story": [
      "The premier of Canada's most populous province on Wednesday threatened to cut off energy supplies to the U.S. if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposed tariffs on Canadian goods. This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",
      "Ford said his province, Canada's federal minister of finance and other provinces will put together a list of items on which the country could impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",
      "\"We need to be ready to fight. This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,\" he said to reporters, referencing Trump's inauguration date, \"and we don't know to what extent this fight is going to go.\"",
      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "In 2023, Ontario also directly supplied electricity to 1.5 million U.S. homes and is a major exporter of power to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Midwestern states in particular could face serious risks if Trump's plan for tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China goes into effect.\u00a0Michigan and Illinois rely heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which account for 19% and 12% of their state GDPs, respectively, according to analysts at Fitch Ratings Group. Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. Canada retaliated with its own duties on U.S products such as whiskey and yogurt coming from a plant in Wisconsin.",

    "summary": "In some U.S. states, more than 40% of residents report having to cut back on basic necessities to afford their electricity bill, survey finds.",
    "story": [
      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",
      "The study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.",
      "\"Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, life is still crazy-expensive, and that can make it hard to pay your bills,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, said in the report. \"Lots of people have found themselves needing to make difficult decisions to keep the lights on. For some, that might mean cutting back on some expenses. For others, it might mean getting a side hustle or a second job.\"",
      "Electricity prices are on the rise. Is it inflation or an underlying issue?Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",

      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

    "summary": "Albertsons said it is calling off its merger with Kroger and is suing the rival grocery chain for breach of contract.",
    "story": [
      "Albertsons on Wednesday called off its $24.6 billion merger with Kroger, a day after a judge temporarily blocked the union, and sued the rival grocery chain for breach of contract.",
      "\"Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,\" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. \"We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.\"",
      "Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia, including the chains Harris Teeter, Mariano's, Ralphs and Smith's. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates roughly 2,300 stores in 34 states, including brands like Jewel Osco, Safeway and Shaw's. Together the companies employ around 700,000 people.",
      "In a separate statement issued Wednesday, Albertsons said it is suing Kroger for willful breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",
      "Albertsons decision to scrap the merger ends a two-year quest to create what would have become the\u00a0largest grocery store merger\u00a0in U.S. history, with the two businesses arguing that combining would have helped them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon.",
      "But on Tuesday, an Oregon court ruled that the proposed union would harm grocery industry competition, finding in favor of the Federal Trade Commission, which had argued the deal would violate antitrust law.",
      "\"The Kroger-Albertsons deal always faced an uphill battle in its bid for approval,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a report. \"Of all the cases the FTC has litigated over the past few years, this one was the most sensitive as it involved two huge firms supplying essential goods.\"",
      "Albertsons alleges breach of contract",
      "Albertsons alleges that Kroger failed \"to exercise 'best efforts' and to take 'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction, as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties,\" according to the statement.",
      "In the statement, Albertsons claimed that Kroger breached the merger agreement by \"repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, Kroger called Albertsons' claims \"baseless and without merit.\"",
      "\"Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process,\" a spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The companies could have appealed the rulings or proceeded to the in-house FTC hearings. Albertsons' decision to instead pull out of deal surprised some industry experts.",
      "\"I'm in a state of professional and commercial shock that they would take this scorched earth approach,\" said Burt Flickinger, a longtime analyst and owner of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \"The logical thing would have been for Albertsons to let the decision sink in for a day and then meet and see what could be done. But the lawsuit seems to make that a moot issue.\"",
      "Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia, including brands like Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter.

      "But the FTC sued to block the merger earlier this year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers' wages by eliminating competition. It also said the divestiture plan was inadequate and that C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.",

    "summary": "The judge criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for Sandy Hook families.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion.",
      "The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez's decision means Jones can stay at Infowars in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "At the end of a lengthy two-day hearing in a Texas courtroom, Lopez criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "\"You got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\" Lopez said.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars' assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion's bid during the hearing.",
      "\"Only two people showed up to bid and\u2026one was just better than the other,\" Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \"by a lot.\"",
      "Although The Onion's cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American's bid.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\"I can't imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\" Jones said on his show Tuesday. \"I mean it's head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\"",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "CBS News has reached to The Onion and representatives of Jones for comment on the ruling.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones' personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones' personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families' offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \"disappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\"",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon, then Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, cross-examined him into the early evening.",
      "Broocks noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Broocks also questioned Murray about last-minute changes to the proposed sale to The Onion, with Murray responding that they were the result of different viewpoints on the numbers being settled.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights.",
      "After being named the winning bidder last month, The Onion CEO Bell Collins briefly described its plans for Infowars in a statement to social media.",
      "\"We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website. We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off. I can't wait to show you what we have cooked up,\" he wrote.",
      "The Onion said its \"exclusive launch advertiser\" would be the gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety.",

      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",

      "If you have yet to buy a Christmas tree this year, take cheer \u2014 prices are roughly the same as in 2023.",
      "Growers weren't expecting to raise wholesale prices, according to an annual survey by the Real Christmas Tree Board, based in Howell, Michigan, and sponsored by annual fees paid by growers and importers.",
      "\"It's similar to last year. From what we're hearing, wholesalers are holding their prices,\" Jill Sidebottom, a spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that advocates for the tree industry, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For consumers, Christmas trees this holiday season will average around $80 to upwards of $100, compared with $75 in 2023 and in line with the previous year's figures, according to the group.",
      "\"Since COVID, demand thankfully has been very high, and we appreciate that families are still putting up a real tree. The alternative is plastic, and that's not good for the environment,\" Lisa Angevine-Bergs, owner of the Angevine Farm in Warren, Connecticut, and executive director of the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's more expensive the closer to the city you get,\" she said.",
      "\"The original tight supply goes back to 2008, when there was an oversupply and growers stopped planting as many,\" said Sidebottom, noting that it takes up to a decade to grow a tree. Extreme weather, including a 2021 heat dome, also killed a lot of trees in the Pacific Northwest, she added.",
      "Christmas trees are grown in every U.S. state, with Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan producing the most. Trees are also imported from Canada, with tree types including the Douglas fir imported from British Columbia.",
      "\"We have plenty of live Christmas trees in stock ready for customers and are excited for a great holiday season. We work with supplier partners all over the country to grow our live goods, including live Christmas trees, to ensure we have ample inventory,\" a spokesperson for retailer Home Depot said in an emailed statement.",
      "Drought conditions hit parts of the country in recent months, resulting in wildfires in parts of the East Coast and potentially sleepless nights for tree farmers, given roots that were not properly hydrated in the fall may not make it.",
      "\"We were very worried that it would impact the trees for this year. Thankfully we have not seen any issues,\" Angevine-Bergs said. \"We started cutting some trees early just to see, and in November we began realizing this year's trees are not going to be affected -- taller trees have deeper roots.\"",
      "The roughly 8-foot tree now standard for the Christmas holiday typically takes about eight years to grow, with a white pine, for instance, growing quickly and white fir and spruce trees taking longer.",
      "\"There's about a foot of growth a year, so you're sitting on your money a long time,\" Sidebottom said of the investment made by growers as they wait for their seedlings to sprout and flourish into mature trees.",
      "Just like the holiday shopping season, Americans have moved up the timing as to when they purchase Christmas trees. Last year, a third of Americans bought their Christmas trees during the week after Thanksgiving and another 33% made the purchase during the first week of December, according to a poll of 1,499 adults taken in August and September last year.",
      "Another 16% bought their tree in the second week of December; 14% claimed a tree before Thanksgiving; 3% in the third week of December and only 1% on Christmas Eve, the survey found.",

      "In decades past, \"We never sold trees before Thanksgiving,\" said Angevine-Berg of her roughly 50 acre farm, in the family for 156 years and selling Christmas trees since 1960. \"As a child, we were always busy on Christmas Eve, and now you wouldn't necessarily be open.

    "summary": "The 93-year-old media mogul has argued family trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent.",
    "story": [
      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper that his client and his client's son were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal.",

      "Gorman in his conclusion said: \"The effort was an attempt to stack the deck in Lachlan Murdoch's favor after Rupert Murdoch's passing so that his succession would be immutable. The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\"",

    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 05:45:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The IIHS says a \"small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian,\" and our penchant for big vehicles \"has intensified that effect.\"",
    "story": [
      "Researchers at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety who looked back at data on more than 200 vehicle-pedestrian crashes in the U.S. say Americans' preference for large, tall vehicles is compounding the risks of serious injury to pedestrians associated with higher-speed crashes. The authors of the IIHS study conclude that the size of many American vehicles means serious pedestrian injuries are more likely in crashes when compared to the expected risks on the roads in Europe, where vehicles are generally smaller.",
      "IIHS researchers analyzed 202 crashes involving a vehicle and at least one pedestrian aged 16 or older between 2015 and 2022 in four states, \"to generate an estimate for the link between injury outcomes and impact speed,\" with information about the front-end height of the vehicles being used additionally \"to examine the moderating effect of\" the vehicle's size on the outcome for the pedestrians.",
      "\"A small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian. Our fondness for tall SUVs and pickups in the U.S. has intensified that effect,\" IIHS President David Harkey was quoted as saying about the study's findings.",
      "While it was already understood that more speed at the point of impact increases risks to pedestrians struck by vehicles, the IIHS said the new study was carried out to provide, \"an updated estimate of pedestrian injury risk at different severity levels\" based on the evolving design of vehicles on U.S. roads today.",
      "\"As expected, impact speed strongly predicted injury risk, and hood leading edge height significantly increased the risk of pedestrian injury overall as well as the potency of impact speed for serious injuries,\" the IIHS said.",
      "While the study found no significant change in risk to pedestrians based on the weight of the vehicles involved, the IIHS said that, \"in general, higher vehicle front ends increased the likelihood of both moderate and serious pedestrian injuries.\"",
      "For example, it said that when a median-height pickup, with a front end about 13 inches higher than most cars, hits a pedestrian at 27 mph, there's a 83% chance of moderate injury and a 62% chance of serious injury, compared to 60% and a 30% respectively if the vehicle involved in the crash is a median-height car.",
      "\"Although SUVs are a growing share of the market in Europe, the passenger vehicle fleet there has long been dominated by cars. In contrast, the majority of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads today are SUVs or pickups,\" IIHS senior statistician Sam Monfort, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying by the institute. \"These choices have very real consequences for pedestrian safety.\"",
      "\"Speed increases have a more pronounced effect when taller vehicles are involved\" in a crash, the organization said. \"For example, as crash speed increases from 15 mph to 35 mph, the risk of a serious injury goes from 9% to 52% when a median-height car is involved. With a median [height] pickup, the risk shoots up from 11% to 91%.\"",
      "Previous research by the IIHS published in 2022 found that drivers of bigger vehicles were more likely to hit pedestrians while making turns than drivers of cars, and another IIHS study published last year that pickups, SUVs and vans with hoods higher than 40 inches at the front edge were about 45% more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities in crashes than cars and other vehicles with lower, sloping hoods.",
      "Despite the concern over the impact of larger vehicles in U.S. pedestrian crashes, however, data showed 2023 saw the first overall year-on-year decline in pedestrian deaths from vehicle accidents in about four years, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2023 dropped 5.4% compared to the previous year \u2014 which saw a 40-year high \u2014 but it was still 14.1% higher than the number of deaths recorded in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.",

And a vast majority of them should not be in jail. A vast majority should not be in jail, and they've suffered gravely. And I say, why is it that in Portland and in many other places, Minneapolis, why is it that nothing happened with them and they actually caused death and destruction at levels not seen before? So you know, if you take a look at what happened in Seattle, you had people die, you had a lot of death, and nothing happened, and these people have been treated really, really badly. Yeah, it's an important issue for me. They've suffered greatly, and in many cases they should not have suffered.",

In other words, if she would have gone out and just did interviews where they're comparable to Steve [Cheung, Trump's communications director], if there is anybody comparable, would say, could you do an interview here? An interview there? You know, she didn't do anything. And people said, Is there something wrong with her? Why would they? I mean, I'm doing this interview with you. I did interviews with, if I had the time, anybody that would ask, I'd do interviews. I think the Joe Rogan interview, you know, that went on for almost three and a half hours.",

I think they made a big tactical mistake by literally not talking to the press, even if a really friendly, I mean, and they had almost all friendly, somebody would come up with a really friendly \u2014 like you guys, maybe \u2014 but a friendly interview, and they turned everybody down. They wouldn't do the basic. And people, including me, would start to say, is there something wrong with her? What's wrong? Why wouldn't you do some basic interviews? And then she had some pretty failed interviews, and maybe it was highlighted more than it would.

I specifically didn't want to read it because it wasn't under my auspices, and I wanted to be able to say that, you know, the only way I can say I have nothing to do with it is if you don't read it. I don't want \u2014 I didn't want to read it. I read enough about it. They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don't like. I won't go into individual items, but I had nothing to do with Project 2025. Now, if we had a few people that were involved, they had hundreds of them. This is a big document, from what I understand.",
      "Time: More than 800 pages.",

      "Time: Really?",
      "Trump: I let them know, yeah, I didn't think it was appropriate, because it's not me. Why would they do that? They complicated my election by doing it because people tried to tie me and I didn't agree with everything in there, and some things I vehemently disagreed with, and I thought it was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that prior to my election.",
      "Time: Did you express those frustrations with them?",
      "Trump: Oh I did. It wasn't a frustration, it was a fact. It's totally inappropriate. They come up with an 800-page document, and the enemy, which is, you know, the other party, is allowed to go through and pick out two items, 12 items out of, you know, 800. No, I thought it was an open \u2014 I thought it was a very foolish thing for them to do.",

      "Time: Can I shift to the transgender issue? Obviously, sort of a major issue during the campaign. In 2016, you said that transgender people could use whatever bathroom they chose. Do you still feel that way?",
      "Trump: When was that?",
      "Time: In 2016.",
      "Trump: I don't want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it's a very small number of people we're talking about, and it's ripped apart our country, so they'll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees. I am a big believer in the Supreme Court, and I'm going to go by their rulings, and so far, I think their rulings have been rulings that people are going along with, but we're talking about a very small number of people, and we're talking about it, and it gets massive coverage, and it's not a lot of people.",
      "Time: But on that note, there's a big fight on this in Congress now. The incoming trans member from Delaware, Sarah McBride, says we should all be focused on more important issues. Do you agree?",

      "Turning to immigration, the Time journalists noted that federal law prohibits using the military as law enforcement on U.S. soil. They asked Trump how that squares with his promise to use the military to facilitate his mass deportation plans:",
      "Time: You recently said on Truth Social that you plan to use the military to deport migrants. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. What will you do if the military does not or refuses to carry out your orders?",
      "Trump: Well, it doesn't, it doesn't stop the military if it's an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country. We have criminals coming into our countries that we've never seen, we've never seen before. We have people coming in at levels and at record numbers that we've never seen before. And I'll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help. We'll also get National Guard. We'll get National Guard, and we'll go as far as I'm allowed to go, according to the laws of our country.",

      "Time: Along with Vivek Ramaswamy, yes, absolutely. But on Musk specifically, giving him the power to oversee the agencies that regulate his companies. Isn't that a conflict of interest?",
      "Trump: I don't think so. Look, we have a country that is bloated with rules, regulations and with, frankly, people that are unnecessary to do. We are going to need a lot of people in a lot of other jobs. We're looking to get people into private sector jobs where they can do better and be more productive. We're going to see what happens. We have some interesting months coming up, at the beginning. We're going to see what happens. But this country is bloated.",
      "Time: I think everybody agrees that there's waste in the federal government\u2014",
      "Trump: Waste, fraud, and abuse.",
      "Time: But Elon Musk is talking about cuts that would directly affect NASA, which would then directly affect SpaceX, his company. Isn't that the textbook definition of a conflict of interest?",
      "Trump: I think that Elon puts the country long before his company. I mean, he's in a lot of companies, but he really is, and I've seen it. He considers this to be his most important project, and he wanted to do it. And, you know, I think, I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company.",

      "Time: Right. Well, no, tell me.",
      "Trump: Well, I just said it. You can't reach an agreement if you abandon, in my opinion. And I disagree with the whole thing, because it should have never happened. Putin would have never invaded Ukraine if I were president for numerous reasons. Number one, they drove up the oil price. When they drove up the oil price, they made it a profit-making situation for him, the oil price should have been driven down. If it was driven down, you wouldn't have had it wouldn't have started just for pure economic reasons. But when it hits $80, $85, and $90 a barrel. I mean, he made, he made a lot of money. I'm not saying it's a good thing, because he's also suffered, but they are moving forward. You know, this is a war that's been \u2014 this is a tragedy.

I want, I don't want people killed, you know? I don't want people from either side killed, and that includes whether it's Russia, Ukraine, or whether it's the Palestinians and the Israelis and all of the, you know, the different entities that we have in the Middle East. There's so many different entities. But I don't want people killed.",
      "Time: When you say productive things are happening, can you be more specific?",
      "Trump: No, I can't. I mean, I'd love to be, I would so love to be, but I can't. I will be. We're going to sit down in a period of time, hopefully soon, and I'll tell you all the things that are happening. But there are some very productive things happening. I do think\u2014okay, because I'm looking at two, two primary fronts, right? You have the Russia-Ukraine, and you have this, and there are other problems also. But look, when North Korea gets involved, that's another element that's a very complicating factor. And I know Kim Jong Un, I get along very well with Kim Jong Un. I'm probably the only one he's ever really dealt with. When you think about it, I am the only one he's ever dealt with. But you have a lot of very bad complicating factors there, but we'll sit down and we'll at the end of each of these, or both, maybe simultaneously, we'll sit down and I'll show you what a good job I did.",
      "Time: You mentioned the Palestinian people. In your first term, your administration put forward the most comprehensive plan for a two-state solution in a long time. Do you still support that plan?",
      "Trump: I support a plan of peace, and it can take different forms. When I did the Abraham Accords, that should have been loaded up with people, you know. I made a statement. I think they didn't add one country. Think of it. They didn't add one country to the Abraham Accords. We had the four countries, very important countries, but that should have been loaded up with Middle Eastern countries.",
      "Time: Do you still support a two-state solution?",
      "Trump: I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump claimed in his Person of the Year interview with Time magazine this week that President Biden's administration lost track of more than 300,000 migrant children who crossed the border unaccompanied, saying many of them are in danger or dead. But experts say he's distorting the facts.",
      "\"We have 325,000 children here during Democrats \u2014 and this was done by Democrats \u2014 who are right now slaves, sex slaves or dead,\" Trump said. \"And what I will be doing will be trying to find where they are and get them back to their parents.\"",
      "Trump repeated similar claims on the campaign trail, and Republicans, including Trump's appointed \"border czar\" Tom Homan, have echoed similar figures as they call for increased border security.",
      "But immigration experts tell CBS News these claims are misleading and misrepresent government data. Additionally, they say while some unaccompanied minors have become victims of trafficking or other crimes, the government safely releases most of these children to vetted sponsors \u2014 often a family member \u2014 while their immigration cases play out.",
      "Possible origins of the number",
      "Republicans began making claims that more than 300,000 unaccompanied children had been \"lost\" after the Department of Homeland Security released a report in August which showed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, did not serve notices to appear in court to 291,000 children between fiscal year 2019 and\u00a0 May 2024.",
      "Additionally, 32,000 unaccompanied children failed to show up for immigration court dates from fiscal year 2019 to 2023.",
      "Notably, around half of this period occurred when Trump was president. The report did not specify the number of children who missed court appearances under each administration.",
      "While the DHS report stated that children who do not attend their court hearings can be at a higher risk of being trafficked or exploited, it did not say that the total 323,000 children referenced are unaccounted for or missing.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for clarification on Trump's claims.",
      "Experts point to ICE's \"missing paperwork problem\"",
      "In response to the DHS report, ICE said delays in issuing court notices to some of 291,000 unaccompanied children may stem from some being eligible to apply for asylum or legal status. In some cases, that process might be allowed to play out before ICE sends them a court date to begin removal proceedings.",
      "\"This is not a 'missing kids' problem; it's a 'missing paperwork' problem,\" said Jonathan Beier, an associate director of research at the Acacia Center for Justice's Unaccompanied Children Program, which helps represent migrant children.",
      "In the cases of the 32,000 minors who missed immigration court dates, experts on immigration law explained that these minors could miss court for numerous reasons, including that they did not receive their notice to appear because ICE did not have their correct address on file.",
      "Sometimes there are communication failures between ICE and other government agencies \u2014 including the Department of Health and Human Services, which is entrusted with finding children living arrangements with a shelter or sponsor while they await legal proceedings.",
      "\"I think for the most part, many of these children have been placed with loving family members,\"\u00a0 said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council.",
      "What we know about claims that unaccompanied children face dangers",

    "story": [
      "Two top Senate Democrats are calling for President-elect Donald Trump's potential appointees to be required to disclose any communications they had with Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser, after allegations recently surfaced that Epshteyn was soliciting financial payments in connection to their efforts to secure government appointments.",
      "\"All nominees appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee should immediately act to retain all communications with Mr. Epshteyn, provide those materials to the Committee well in advance of their hearing date, and be prepared to testify regarding any discussions with Mr. Epshteyn about receiving a potential appointment in the incoming administration,\" Democratic Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island wrote in a letter shared with CBS News and the conservative publication Just the News.",
      "The letter was addressed to Republican Sens. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and also copied to Trump's transition team leader Susie Wiles. It asks that the senior Republicans require any Trump appointees who come before the Judiciary Committee for confirmation to \"preserve and produce to the Committee any communications with Mr. Epshteyn.\"",
      "The senators wrote that \"questions remain regarding whether any nominees made promises or other assurances to Mr. Epshteyn as a condition of his support.\"",
      "A transition source called the letter a \"pathetic Lawfare tactic.\"",
      "Epshteyn previously told CBS News he was honored to be working for President-elect Trump and that the allegations against him were patently false.",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "Graham's office said it would defer comment to Grassley, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Grassley said in a statement, \"Committee members will have the opportunity to ask nominees questions on these issues when they come before the Senate for a hearing.\"",
      "Late last month, the New York Times reported that attorney David Warrington, who will be Trump's incoming White House counsel, conducted a review into the allegations against Epshteyn and concluded that Epshteyn had solicited payment from at least two people. The Times reported that Warrington recommended that Trump keep his distance from Epshteyn.",
      "Last month, CBS News reported that Trump's transition team was grappling with internal strife over Epshteyn's conduct related to possible candidates for positions in the Trump administration. At least one Republican politician, former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, alleged in a sworn declaration to the transition team that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with the internal investigation being conducted by Warrington, who also served as general counsel to the Trump campaign.",
      "The Trump transition team confirmed it had conducted a review and now intended to move on from the issue, as first reported by CNN. \"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" said transition spokesman Steven Cheung at the time. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",

      "New Jersey residents and lawmakers are pushing for more information about\u00a0mysterious drone sightings, including some near military installations.",
      "A federal official said Thursday that the FBI is the lead agency investigating along with the New Jersey state police. Local law enforcement are also investigating.",
      "The NYPD said Thursday that multiple drones were also seen flying over a New York City neighborhood in the Bronx, but soon after officers responded to calls about the sightings, the drones disappeared.",
      "What have authorities said about the drone sightings?",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said during a call-in program on Wednesday night\u00a0that he would be bringing up the issue with the White House on Thursday but assured constituents that the drones as of now don't appear to pose a safety threat.",
      "\"Based on everything we know,\" Murphy said, \"there is no public safety risk we're aware of. On the other hand, is it frustrating to not have more answers on this? Is it frustrating to not have a source for these things? Yes.\"",
      "White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that \"we have not been able to corroborate any of the reported visual sightings\" and that many of the drones are manned aircraft being operated lawfully.",
      "An FBI official earlier this week told Congress that the FBI has received over 3,000 tips from the public about these incursions, which are mostly occurring at night.",
      "On Thursday, Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a briefing \"as soon as possible on how your agencies are working with federal and local law enforcement to identify and address the source of these incursions.\"",
      "The FAA said Thursday that at the request of federal partners, it had published two temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.",

      "Where are the drones coming from?",
      "\"Our initial assessment is that this is not the work of a foreign adversary or a foreign entity,\" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Wednesday.",
      "After assessing that the drones are not a threat to military installations, the Pentagon is leaving it up to local law enforcement and the FBI to investigate the origins and type of drones.",
      "Singh said the drones were not U.S. military drones, and she refuted an idea presented by Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey that there was an Iranian \"mothership\" off the East Coast of the United States launching the drones.",
      "Why not shoot them down?",
      "Some lawmakers have called for shooting down the drones to analyze them, but others have voiced concern over falling debris endangering highly populated areas.",
      "Singh, the Pentagon deputy press secretary, said base commanders have the authority to shoot them down if they pose a threat to military installations, but so far, there hasn't been a threat.",
      "U.S. Northern Command, which oversees protecting the territory of the United States, said in a statement that it has not received requests from local law enforcement to assist.",
      "\"We are aware and monitoring the reports of unauthorized drone flights in the vicinity of military installations in New Jersey to include Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle, and we refer you to those installations for information on any efforts they are may be conducting to ensure the safety and security of their personnel and operations,\" the statement said.",
      "Is this a one-of-a-kind incident?",
      "This drone mystery falls on the heels of others in the past year or so.",
      "One of the most notable cases was in December 2023, Langley Air Force Base in Virginia reported multiple drone incursions throughout that December. In a statement at the time, the base said that the number of drones fluctuated and they ranged in size and configuration.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

      "\"Our review of documented CHS reporting in FBI field offices as of January 6 did not identify any potentially critical intelligence related to a possible attack on the Capitol on January 6 that had not been provided to law enforcement stakeholders prior to January 6,\" the inspector general said.",
      "More than two dozen individuals utilized by the FBI as confidential human sources were in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, ahead of the Capitol breach, but none were authorized by their handlers to illegally enter the Capitol building or join the riot that day, the inspector general's report said.",
      "No undercover FBI agents or employees were found to have attended the Jan. 6 protests or taken part in the attack, the report said.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, revealed that federal investigators tasked just three of the 26 FBI sources in the city that day to gather information for domestic terrorism cases, and the remaining individuals were not directed to be there. In all, four confidential human sources entered the Capitol building during the riot and 11 were on restricted Capitol grounds.",
      "According to the Justice Department, confidential human sources are those \"believed to be providing useful and credible information to the FBI and whose identity, information, or relationship with the FBI warrants confidential handling.\" Federal investigators conventionally utilize these individuals to report on members of criminal organizations and provide information that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The use of confidential human sources around the time of the Jan. 6 Capitol breach has been a point of contention on Capitol Hill, and outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray has faced questions from Republican lawmakers about the practice.",
      "In the days after the riot, questions surfaced about the intelligence gathered ahead of the attack and whether it was properly acted upon by federal investigators. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the FBI correctly identified a potential for violence as Congress was set to certify the results of Joe Biden's 2020 victory over Donald Trump and took appropriate steps in preparation. The U.S. Capitol Police \u2014 not the FBI \u2014 led law enforcement efforts to protect the Electoral College certification that day, while other agencies provided support.",
      "On the eve of the riot, the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, issued a raw intelligence report warning of an anonymous social media thread threatening violence at the Capitol, CBS News previously reported. But, according to Capitol Police officials, that information was never shared with their agency. The FBI has defended its handling of the intelligence.",
      "\"Many of these 26 confidential human sources had provided information relevant to the January 6 Electoral Certification before the event and\u2026a few CHSs also provided information about the riot as it occurred,\" Horowitz wrote. The report revealed some sources were in contact or traveling with members of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, organizations whose leadership has since been convicted at trial of seditious conspiracy as a result of the attack.",
      "In response to the report, the FBI said it disagreed with \"certain factual assertions\u2026regarding the manner of specific steps, and the scope of the canvass undertaken by the FBI in advance of January 6, 2021.\"",
      "After the Capitol breach, the FBI launched one of the largest federal probes in American history, and prosecutors have since charged more than 1,500 defendants with crimes ranging from illegal entry into the Capitol building to assaulting police and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Nearly 1,000 of those charged have entered into plea deals with the Justice Department and admitted guilt. Another 200 have been convicted at trial before a judge or jury.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's report revealed that none of the FBI's confidential human sources who entered the Capitol or restricted grounds that day were among the hundreds criminally charged for doing so.",
      "In response to the report's findings, the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., which has spearheaded the Capitol breach investigation, said, \"The D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office generally has not charged those individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals; and we have treated the CHSs consistent with this approach.\"",
      "Despite President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to issue pardons for some of the defendants, federal prosecutors have continued to charge individuals for alleged crimes tied to the Capitol attack in the weeks after the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Some defendants and their legal teams have pushed for early release from prison or a pause in their proceedings ahead of Trump's inauguration. Federal judges overseeing the cases have mostly denied those requests. Advocates on behalf of the defendants have urged Trump to issue pardons.",
      "\"I'm going to be acting very quickly,\" Trump said earlier this week in an interview with NBC News. Trump has tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his nominee to lead the Justice Department. She and other department officials could be involved in the legal processes involved with any pardon decisions.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,\" the White House said.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It's the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.",
      "Many of the pardons are for long-ago, non-violent drug offenses. Among the pardoned is 39-year-old Emily Good Nelson of Indianapolis, convicted of non-violent drug offenses at 19. Since her release, the White House said she has completed her bachelor's and master's degrees, and has volunteered as a counselor at an in-patient psychiatric facility.",
      "Russell Thomas Portner, 74, of Washington state, is also among those pardoned for non-violent drug offenses. He served in the Army during the Vietnam War and earned a Bronze Star. Since his conviction, he has married, raised four children, run a business, and developed a reputation for generosity and community service, the White House said.",
      "The full list of pardons and commutations is\u00a0here.",
      "\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,\" the White House said.",
      "Mr. Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before he left office in 2017.",
      "\"America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.\"",
      "The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes, criticizing the Justice Department's handling of his son's case in his statement explaining the pardon. The president had previously said he would not pardon Hunter. One of Mr. Biden's closest allies, former top aide Anita Dunn, said she agreed with his decision to pardon Hunter but she criticized the way in which the pardon happened.",
      "\"I do not agree with the way it was done, I don't agree with the timing, and I don't agree, frankly, with the attack on our judicial system,\" Dunn said at The New York Times' annual DealBook summit.",
      "Mr. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He's also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office.",
      "Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran.",
      "The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He's also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and 34 other lawmakers are urging the president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron.",
      "Others are advocating for Mr. Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused federal executions. Mr. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, it's likely executions will resume. During his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic.",
      "More pardons are coming before Mr. Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but it's not clear whether he'll take action to guard against possible prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power.",
      "\"My administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement.",
      "The president has been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as much as six months - before the presidential election - but has been concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.",
      "But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was the chairman of the congressional committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a pardon from Mr. Biden would be \"unnecessary,\" and that the president shouldn't be spending his waning days in office worrying about this.",
      "A president has the power to both pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. It's customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms.",
      "Before pardoning his son, Mr. Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasn't a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"The President's categorical approach to clemency has also inspired leaders across the country to take similar action,\" the White House said Thursday. \"Over ten states and localities, including Maryland and Massachusetts, have issued categorical clemency for marijuana convictions, impacting hundreds of thousands of people and allowing individuals to move past their convictions and move on with their daily lives.\"",

      "FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he will resign from his post at the end of the current administration, leaving the bureau in advance of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month.",
      "He made the announcement during a packed, standing-room town hall with FBI employees at the bureau's headquarters Wednesday.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,\" he said. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\"",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway \u2014 this is not easy for me,\" Wray continued. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI.\"",
      "Thousands from FBI offices across the country tuned in for the live stream of his speech. Some people cried as Wray spoke. At the end of his remarks, he received a standing ovation that went on for over a minute, until Wray left the room.",
      "The president-elect welcomed Wray's announcement in a social media post, calling it \"a great day for America.\"",
      "Trump appointed Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 as FBI director in 2017 for a 10-year term after firing James Comey. Wray has since come under fire from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill over the FBI's handling of investigations into the president-elect. He has remained director under President Biden, but Trump previously said he intended to remove Wray and replace him with Kash Patel, a former GOP congressional staffer who was tapped by Trump during his first term for roles in the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Wray told the FBI's rank and file, \"We're not on any one side \u2026 We're on the American people's side,\" and on \"the Constitution's side,\" adding, that \"no matter what's happening out there, in here, we've got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time \u2014 with rigor and integrity.\"",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray, saying in a statement that he \"has served our country honorably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as the Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties.\"",
      "\"The Director of the FBI is responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations,\" Garland said. \"That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear. Director Wray has done that job with integrity and skill.\"",
      "CBS News has learned Wray wrestled with his decision to step down but opted to go because he's concerned if he were to stay, the attacks on him could drag the FBI into another political fight it doesn't need.",
      "FBI directors are appointed for a 10-year term, which has historically been intended to ensure the position is insulated from political considerations. But presidents have the power to fire and nominate directors at will, and many FBI directors have not served their full terms. The Senate must also vote to confirm any president's nominee to serve as FBI director.",
      "Wray's announcement clears the way for Patel to lead the FBI in Trump's second term. Patel has been meeting in the Capitol with senators who will vote on his confirmation.",
      "Wray and FBI leadership became targets of Trump's ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The investigation culminated in criminal charges against Trump filed by special counsel Jack Smith, but they have since been dismissed by a federal judge. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "If confirmed, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus, amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate Patel to the position raised speculation among federal law enforcement about whether Wray would resign or remain in his post ahead of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Wray took over the post after Trump fired then-Director James Comey, in part because of the FBI's investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel for that case. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.",
      "Since his confirmation in 2017, Wray has spent much of his tenure focusing on internal matters like agent recruitment and national security issues including countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia.",
      "The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage and child exploitation.",
      "Patel, who could soon be Wray's replacement, has been outspoken in his criticism of the federal agency and has said he would implement massive reforms and seek retribution for Trump, saying at one point, \"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "In his remarks, Wray reminded the bureau's employees that working at the FBI \"means conducting investigations without fear or favor ... and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication is not there.\"",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate the 44-year-old Patel to serve as FBI Director was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and some former officials from Trump's first term.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0,\" a reaction that prompted pushback from Trump allies and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance.",

      "Last year, the president and first lady introduced a White House initiative to undertake what they said would be the \"most comprehensive\" effort any administration has taken to support women's health research. \"We've invested nearly $1 billion in this research on women's health \u2026 and the women of this country are paying attention,\" said Jill Biden, who has been spearheading the initiative.",
      "Earlier this year, the president signed an executive order to address disparities in women's health research, calling for the expansion of data collection and prioritizing funding for \"diseases and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men.\"",
      "The initiative has secured funding from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department, to augment research on understudied areas of women's health. The Pentagon is using the funding to study arthritis, cancer and chronic fatigue \u2014 all ailments that affect women in the military.",
      "\"The fact is, the health of our moms and grandmothers, sisters, and daughters, friends and colleagues affects not just women's well-being, but the prosperity of the entire nation,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "The Biden administration is also trying to advance research on women's midlife health, on concerns including menopause, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and heart disease, which is the leading cause of death among women.",
      "Jill Biden pointed to a study by the Mayo Clinic that estimated an annual loss of $1.8 billion in the U.S. based on workdays missed due to menopause symptoms, presenting an argument that ignoring women's health problems is damaging the nation.",
      "\"Women should not be sent away from emergency rooms. Women should not be told that their cardiovascular symptoms are stress and anxiety and that they should go home and get some rest,\" said panelist Nancy Brown, the chief executive officer of the American Heart Association.",
      "As Mr. Biden's term comes to a close next month, Democrats have expressed concern over protections for women's health care during a second Trump administration.",
      "But Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CBS News in a statement, \"President Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on that promise.\"",

      "Russell Taylor, who was part of a group affiliated with the far-right, anti-government Three Percenters that was accused of plotting and planning to disrupt the electoral count, asked U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth if he can travel with his wife and children to Washington, D.C., and Maryland for the inauguration.",
      "Taylor's lawyer, Dyke Huish, said in a court filing that Taylor was invited to attend the ceremony by retired Rep. Chris Stewart, of Utah. Huish stated that Taylor had completed his home confinement and was in compliance with his probation. He wrote that Taylor \"does not pose any risk or concern for this travel request.\"",
      "Taylor admitted he had helped organize an effort on Telegram to travel to Washington on Jan. 6, to be \"ready and willing to fight.\"",

He recorded a video in which he was seen urging rioters to fight with and push forward against police. Later that day, he posted on Telegram, \"I was pushing through traitors all day today. WE STORMED THE CAPITOL! Freedom was fully demonstrated today!\"",

      "Prosecutors recommended a prison term of almost 4.5 years for Taylor, but Lamberth instead sentenced him to three years of probation and 100 hours of community service. Lamberth said he believed Taylor had testified truthfully and expressed sincere remorse, and he said Taylor's cooperation had been \"essential,\" which earned him the chance to avoid prison time.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House approved the massive $895 billion National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday, after a controversial provision on gender-affirming care prompted backlash from Democrats and threatened to topple the must-pass bill's chances in the chamber.",
      "In a 281 to 140 vote, the House approved the 1,800 page national security legislation to authorize funding for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2025. While the majority of Democrats opposed the bill, 81 joined with 200 Republicans in support of its passage. Just 16 Republicans opposed the legislation. It now heads to the Senate for approval.",
      "The vote came after leaders in Congress struck a deal over the weekend on the legislation, which usually passes with wide bipartisan margins. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries acknowledged ahead of the vote on Wednesday that there's \"a lot of positive things\" within the NDAA that were negotiated in a bipartisan manner, but also some \"troubling\" provisions.",
      "Jeffries said Democrats didn't whip the NDAA vote, saying it would be a \"member-to-member, case-by-case\" decision.",
      "Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson touted the legislation, saying Tuesday it \"includes critical wins for our troops and for our country at a very important time.\"",
      "Johnson cited a 14.5% pay raise for junior service members and improved housing for military families. And he celebrated an expansion of U.S. joint military exercises with Israel and increases in funding for defense initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, among other things.",
      "\"The safety and security of the American people is our top priority,\" Johnson said at a news conference, noting that he expected a \"large\" vote in favor of the legislation. \"And this year's NDAA ensures our military has the resources and the capabilities needed to remain the most powerful fighting force on the planet.\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican also touted the controversial provisions, including how the legislation restricts gender-affirming care for children of servicemembers and halts funds for the teaching of \"critical race theory\" at military academies. He said House Republicans \"gutted the DEI bureaucracy\" with the bill.",
      "The provisions, especially on gender-affirming care, threatened the NDAA's chances in the House on Wednesday, while some key Democrats spoke out in opposition.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, acknowledged a number of bipartisan victories in the final version of the NDAA in a statement when the text of the legislation was released. He said Democrats were \"successful in blocking many harmful provisions that attacked DEI programs, the LGBTQ community, and women's access to reproductive health care.\" But he said the provision banning gender-affirming care is \"wrong.\"",
      "The provision, which applies to the military's health care program, outlines that medical intervention \"for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization may not be provided to a child under the age of 18.\"",
      "Smith said the stipulation \"injected a level of partisanship not traditionally seen in defense bills.\"",
      "\"Speaker Johnson is pandering to the most extreme elements of his party to ensure that he retains his speakership. In doing so, he has upended what had been a bipartisan process,\" Smith added.",
      "House Republicans selected Johnson as their pick for speaker in the next Congress during leadership elections last month. But the Louisiana Republicans will still need to secure the support of the majority of the chamber in the new year to hold onto the gavel. With a razor-thin majority, speaker elections have posed difficulties for Republicans in recent years, while a group on the party's right flank has worked to extract concessions for their support.",
      "Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump and his allies leaned into anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail in the lead up to the 2024 election. And since then, House Republicans led an effort to limit the use of single-sex bathrooms in the Capitol complex to those corresponding to users' \"biological sex\" after the first transgender person was elected to Congress.",

    "summary": "The secretary of state's testimony comes months after Republicans issued a scathing report on the Biden administration's handling of the exit from Afghanistan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement. Another report partially declassified and released by the State Department last year faulted both the Trump and Biden administrations for \"insufficient\" planning surrounding the withdrawal.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans and two independents blocked the nomination of Lauren McFerran to continue serving on the labor board.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture Monday on the nominations of McFerran, a Democrat, to remain for another five-year term on the National Labor Relations Board. McFerran is the current chair of the NLRB whose term is set to expire later this month. Her confirmation to another term would have maintained a Democratic majority on the board, in a move that would have marked a key victory for Democrats heading into a second Trump administration and a Republican trifecta in Washington.",
      "In a 50 to 49 vote, Senate Republicans, joined by independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, blocked the nomination from advancing. Without the confirmation, the board is expected to swing to come under Republican control, with a vacancy for President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming GOP-controlled Senate to fill in the new year.",
      "Schumer praised McFerran ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying she has \"served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where she's known for her fairness, her deep expertise and guiding the board to deal with the challenges of the contemporary work place.\"",
      "\"If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing today's NLRB nominee,\" Schumer said, stressing that \"you can't say you're for working families and then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.\"",
      "The NLRB is an independent federal agency with five board members that serves as a mediator between labor unions and big business by enforcing labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Under the union-friendly Biden administration, the NLRB has delivered a slew of pro-union rulings.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and longtime labor advocate, posted Tuesday on social media\u00a0 that McFerran has \"done an exceptional job protecting workers' rights & standing up against illegal union busting,\" arguing that it's \"imperative that a majority of Senators vote to reconfirm her this week so she can continue this vital work.\"",
      "Republicans largely opposed the nomination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who came out in opposition of McFerran's nomination on Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican, who is leaving leadership in January, said Tuesday in remarks from the Senate floor that his colleagues should consider the \"gross mismanagement of Ms. McFerran's watch.\"",
      "\"Her confirmation would give a lame-duck president control of an independent board well into his successor's term,\" McConnell added.",
      "Manchin, a West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats, also joined with Republicans to oppose advancing the nomination, as did Sinema, an Arizona independent. The two senators, who are often key votes on partisan measures, are both departing the Senate after opting not to seek reelection. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, did not vote.",
      "The vote came as Senate Democrats have been making a last-minute push to confirm President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's judicial confirmations from his first term, but have run into resistance from Republicans in recent weeks who are looking to drag out the process.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:58:42 -0500",
    "summary": "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened,\" a House task force found.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump released a final report on its probe on Tuesday, presenting a series of recommendations to combat future security failures, including reducing the number of officials it protects during campaign season.",
      "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened. There was not, however, a singular moment or decision that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks to nearly assassinate the former President,\" the 180-page report said, noting that \"various failures \u2026 coalesced to create an environment in which the former President \u2014 and everyone at the campaign event \u2014 were exposed to grave danger.\"",
      "The House voted to establish the panel following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, where a gunman opened fire during a rally and a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny following the incident, and its director soon resigned.",
      "The task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, also looked into a second assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which was foiled. Trump was golfing when a Secret Service agent discovered a man with a rifle who was waiting along the tree line of the course.",
      "What the report says",
      "Over the course of the investigation, the task force said it conducted 46 interviews, reviewed 18,000 pages of documents and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach.",
      "The panel found that the \"failures\" that led to the July 13 incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\" The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report says, acknowledging that the Secret Service's mission \"allows no margin for error.\"",
      "The task force made three dozen recommendations, including reducing the number of individuals it protects. The lawmakers also said Congress should examine whether the Secret Service should still be involved in investigating fraud and financial crimes.",
      "\"Congress must consider whether the Secret Service's investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission, and whether the agency's investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security,\" the report said.",
      "\"The number of individuals being protected has greatly expanded, a resource demand which becomes further taxed during the longer and more intensive modern presidential campaign seasons,\" it said, noting that the Secret Service also protects foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly in New York City in September, which comes at the height of the campaign season. \"As a result, Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\"",
      "It also recommended that Secret Service consolidate the plans of all law enforcement entities working an event; fill gaps with its own personnel when local counterparts are unable to provide adequate security; identify all potential lines of sight vulnerabilities; require counter-surveillance assets for all large outdoor events; and address inadequate training. Other recommendations included reviewing protocols for identifying security breaches during golf outings and using a specific type of vehicle, which was redacted in the report, on the golf course.",
      "The panel also called on Congress to review the agency's financial and personnel resources, recommending that it take a look at \"reducing the pace of travel, ensuring overtime is properly compensated, and giving incentives for veteran agents to stay with the USSS beyond minimum retirement ages.\"",
      "While the panel's investigation has wrapped, the task force encouraged relevant committees in Congress to work to address \"important questions\" that it was unable to examine fully. On the top of that list, the panel said, are the motivations of the shooter and would-be shooter, which the panel said \"remain largely unknown.\"",
      "Before wrapping its investigation, the task force held its final hearing last week with testimony from Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, who acknowledged the agency's \"abject failure\" in the July shooting. Rowe outlined a series of changes he had implemented at the agency since the assassination attempt.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Geminid meteor shower peak is a week away, but this year it might be a good idea to keep an eye out early, according to NASA. Dedicated skywatchers might want to check the sky not only in the days ahead of the peak, however \u2014 but also early in the morning.",
      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",
      "Where you can see the Geminids",
      "Meteors from the Geminids will be visible throughout the sky and across the globe, according to NASA. They're best viewed in an area far away from city and street lights.",
      "Viewers \u2014 who should prepare for frigid temperatures \u2014 should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south. Give your eyes a half hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m. local time, with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",
      "\"So with moonlit skies in 2024, you might only catch the brightest meteors,\" according to EarthSky. \"Luckily, many of the Geminids are bright meteors. Try blocking out the moon when watching for meteors.\"",
      "Are any nights this year good for Geminid viewing?",
      "Casual observers won't be able to pick up any noticeable activity from the Geminids until the night of Dec. 11, according to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2013 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "What are the Geminids?",
      "Most meteor showers originate from comets, but the Geminids come from 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid. The Geminids first appeared in the mid-1800s. At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",
      "While most meteors appear to be colorless or white, NASA scientists say the Geminids are bright, fast and usually yellow in color. They streak through the sky at a speed of 22 miles per second.",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. The streak of light is actually glowing, hot air.",

      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday.

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:50:02 -0500",
    "summary": "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division that originated as a San Francisco start-up.",
    "story": [
      "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division.",
      "According to a press release issued Tuesday and subsequent conference call that included GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit automaker will instead focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \"given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\"",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "\"The Cruise Board of Directors and the Cruise leadership team are collaborating closely with GM on next steps,\" Cruise CEO  Marc Whitten told CBS News.",
      "GM bought then San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation in 2016 for at least $1 billion with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis. At the time, Cruise Automation, along with Google, was among the few companies with permits from the state of California to test the cars.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors.",
      "GM even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts\u00a0dragged a pedestrian on a San Francisco street who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",
      "The problems triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "In January of this year, the company offered to pay $75,000 to settle the investigation by California state regulators into Cruise's\u00a0failure to disclose details regarding the collision.",
      "Despite its troubles, Cruise was still attempting to return to viability. In June, General Motors named Marc Whitten -- one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console --\u00a0as the division's new chief executive. In August, Cruise announced its robotaxis\u00a0would join Uber's ride-hailing service in 2025 as part of a multiyear partnership\u00a0bringing together two companies that once appeared poised to compete for passengers.",
      "However, more recent Cruise developments have been costly for GM. In September, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials announced the division would pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a consent order. Last month, Cruise agreed to an additional $500,000 fine after admitting to filing a false report following the San Francisco pedestrian crash.",
      "According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office of the Northern District of California, the San Francisco-based company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in which Cruise admits and accepts responsibility.",
      "\"Companies with self-driving cars that seek to share our roads and crosswalks must be fully truthful in their reports to their regulators,\" said Martha Boersch, Chief of the Office of the U.S. Attorney's Criminal Division, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK -- A New York grand jury is beginning to hear evidence in the case against\u00a0Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office started presenting the case Thursday, seeking to indict Mangione for the fatal shooting\u00a0on Dec. 4 in Midtown Manhattan, CBS News has learned. The DA's office declined to comment on the grand jury proceedings due to confidentiality.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she has spoken with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro multiple times to make sure Mangione is extradited quickly following his arrest\u00a0on unrelated charges in Altoona.",
      "\"I want to get him back here in the State of New York and run him through our criminal justice system. Because that horrific attack occurred on our streets, and the people of our city deserve to have that sense of calm that this perpetrator has been caught and he will never see the light of day again, if there is justice,\" Hochul said in an interview Thursday morning. \"You cannot assassinate an individual on the streets of New York. Not now, not ever.\"",
      "Mangione is being held in his own cell under maximum security at Huntingdon State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania. The Corrections Department says he is not under suicide watch or in solitary confinement, but he does not get to interact with other inmates. They also say he has not been violent.",
      "Sources say Mangione has not made any incriminating statements while in custody.",
      "What happens next in the extradition process?",
      "First, the Manhattan District Attorney's office has to officially file an indictment against Mangione. Hochul said Thursday the DA's office is working to make sure the indictment will be \"iron clad.\"",
      "\"You don't want to have anybody, a defense attorney, be able to attack what you've done. You have to get it right,\" she said. \"We expect that to be issued any day now, and at the second that happens, I'm issuing a warrant for extradition.\"",
      "Next, Hochul plans to issue what's called a governor's warrant, which Shapiro also has to sign. A spokesperson told The Associated Press he is \"prepared to sign and process it promptly as soon as it is received.\"",
      "Under Pennsylvania law, a suspect can be held for 30 days while authorities seek a governor's warrant.",
      "\"I will issue it, he will sign it. But the judge has already set a date for a hearing on Dec. 23. We'll see whether that date has to hold,\" said Hochul. \"The governor and I both want him brought back to New York as soon as possible. So there will be some legal activities from the defense lawyer side, but I believe that the judge will say he's going back to New York. So we're expecting that to happen any day now.\"",
      "Once the warrant has been issued, Mangione has to appear before a Pennsylvania judge to confirm he is the person being sought in New York, either through fingerprints or DNA found at the scene.",
      "In some cases, suspects can be extradited in a matter of days. But the process can drag on for several months if the defense challenges it. To fight extradition, the defense has to file a petition in Pennsylvania by Dec. 24.",
      "Mangione's attorney said his client intends to plead not guilty and wants to examine the evidence that police say they have.",
      "\"As lawyers, we need to see it. We need to see: How did they collect it? How much of it? And then we would have our experts... take a look at that, and then we would challenge its admissibility and challenge the accuracy of those results,\" lawyer Thomas Dickey said in an interview.",
      "NYPD sources tell CBS News once Mangione is extradited back to New York, there are plans to upgrade the charges from second-degree murder to premeditated first-degree murder.",
      "NYPD says evidence links Mangione to murder scene",
      "As Mangione fights extradition from Pennsylvania, investigators say they are amassing a mountain of forensic and ballistic evidence tying the accused killer to the murder of Thompson.",
      "So far, police say they've matched a gun found on him to shell casings at the Manhattan scene and his fingerprints to those collected on a water bottle and a KIND Bar near a Starbucks, where the suspect was seen on surveillance video about a half hour before the shooting. Police also recovered a cellphone from an alley near the hotel and say those fingerprints are a match.",
      "Law enforcement sources tell CBS News that Mangione had a spiral notebook with him when he was arrested where he wrote about considering using a gun over a bomb to carry out an attack because it was targeted, precise and didn't risk innocents.",
      "The working theory on a motive for the murder is animosity toward the health care industry, and authorities believe it may be rooted in a debilitating back injury that Mangione suffered.",
      "Dorian Wright, an instructor at Power Yoga Hawaii, remembers the 26-year-old coming to his studio last year, mentioning he had pain.",
      "\"I remember with him, like a lot of people that come in with injuries, they tell me right in the beginning of class or while we're doing certain poses, they'll say, 'Oh, I can't do this,'\" Wright said. \"If I come to adjust them and help them, they'll say 'Oh, I can't do this, my back.' I do recall him saying something about his back.\"",
      "\"We still have a lot of questions around incidents in his life, personal grievances, stressors,\" said Rebecca Weiner, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism.",
      "Police do not believe Mangione was ever a client of UnitedHealthcare. Rather, investigators think its CEO was targeted because of the company's size.",
      "CBS News obtained an internal UnitedHealth Group memo Thursday, in which CEO Andrew Witty penned, \"I know this has been an extraordinarily difficult week,\" adding, \"We owe it to Brian to make good on our promise to make health care work better for everybody, in every way.\"",
      "\"Murder is murder, and it is totally unacceptable, but I think the outpouring that we have seen indicates that there's a lot of frustration and anger in a health care industry which rejects claims that people desperately need,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said.",
      "New theory on how the suspect fled New York City",
      "As investigators try to piece together how Mangione moved through Pennsylvania, the NYPD told CBS News New York that investigators are no longer operating under the assumption he fled New York City by bus.",

      "Fingerprints and DNA",
      "Authorities said they were able to identify Mangione as the suspect in Thompson's killing relatively quickly because of forensic evidence allegedly tying him to the crime.",
      "\"We have DNA,\" said NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny as the investigation got underway. \"We have fingerprints that's being processed.\"",
      "Police took Mangione's fingerprints when they booked him into jail in Pennsylvania, and those prints matched those left behind on a water bottle and a KIND bar found close to the scene of the shooting, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Wednesday. The bottle and protein bar wrapper were collected near the Starbucks where the suspect was seen on surveillance video minutes before the shooting.",
      "Mangione is also a match for prints found on a cellphone recovered near the site, police said.",
      "The weapon",
      "Police said\u00a0a 3D-printed gun and suppressor found in Mangione's backpack at the time of his arrest was consistent with the weapon used to shoot and kill Thompson, and that they matched the gun in his backpack to three spent 9-mm shell casings found at the scene of the crime. Sometimes called a \"ghost gun,\" this kind of firearm can be made at home using a 3D printer and lacks a serial number, which makes tracking difficult. (Not all ghost guns are illegal, and not all firearms require serial numbers.)",
      "The gun in Mangione's possession had a loaded Glock magazine with six 9-mm rounds and a 3D-printed silencer, according to the criminal complaint filed in Pennsylvania.",
      "Earlier in the investigation into Thompson's death, NYPD sources told CBS News that several words were meticulously written in Sharpie onto shell casings and bullets recovered from the crime scene. The words were \"delay,\" \"deny\" and possibly \"depose,\" which investigators believed could reference \"the D's of insurance\" coined by critics of the industry. The original alliterative list \u2014 \"delay, deny, defend\" \u2014 comments on tactics that insurance companies' opponents say they use to reject claims.",
      "Face mask, clothing, fake IDs",
      "Clothing, including a face mask, and fraudulent identification cards similar to the ones used by the shooter were found in Mangione's possession when he was arrested, police said.",
      "Surveillance video and images of the suspect circulated widely in the aftermath of the shooting, capturing the moment the shots were fired as well as his earlier stops at a Starbucks store in Midtown and at the front desk of a hostel on the Upper West Side, where authorities believe he stayed. The suspect's full face was only visible in surveillance footage from the hostel. Other images and video showed him wearing a black face mask and hooded sweatshirt.",
      "Mangione had a fake New Jersey driver's license on him when he was taken into custody in Pennsylvania, which was consistent with the false identification police say he used to check into that hostel in New York. That license was among multiple fraudulent IDs discovered in his possession, according to police. He also had a United States passport, $8,000 in cash and a handwritten note.",
      "Mangione had been reported missing",
      "Mangione's mother reported her son missing to the San Francisco Police Department in the days before the Dec. 4 shooting, a person close to the investigation told CBS News.",
      "She filed that report in the midst of seemingly broader concerns from Mangione's friends and family over his whereabouts and well-being. Posts tagging him on social media indicated Mangione had lost touch with people to whom he used to be closer.",

      "As part of the process, Trump sat for an interview with Time journalists at Mar-a-Lago at the end of November. The sit-down covered a wide range of topics, from inflation and foreign affairs to abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Time published the 11,345-word transcript of the interview on Thursday, along with a fact-check of many of Trump's claims. Here are the highlights from Trump's answers:",
      "Trump on inflation: \"It's very hard\" to bring prices down",
      "Trump campaigned on bringing down prices for everyday Americans and taming inflation. In the interview, however, Trump acknowledged that lowering prices is likely to be an uphill battle:",
      "Trump: We've had the inflation. [The Democrats] lost on inflation, they lost on immigration, they lost on \u2014 as a part of immigration, I think a very big part is the border, the border itself. You know, if you can self subdivide the word immigration. They lost on the economy. But it was a different kind of \u2014 it was the economy as it pertains to groceries and small things that are actually big things for a family.",
      "Time: If the prices of groceries don't come down, will your presidency be a failure?",
      "Trump: I don't think so. Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down. I think a better supply chain is going to bring them down. You know, the supply chain is still broken. It's broken.",
      "Trump says he'll pardon Jan. 6 defendants on a \"case by case\" basis soon after taking office",
      "Trump fielded questions about whether he would issue pardons for the more than 1,500 people who have been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, when a mob of Trump's supporters tried to stop Congress' certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election:",
      "Time: Have you decided yet whether you're going to pardon all of the January 6 defendants?",
      "Trump: Yes.",
      "Time: You're going to do all of them?",
      "Trump: I'm going to do case-by-case, and if they were non-violent, I think they've been greatly punished. And the answer is I will be doing that, yeah, I'm going to look if there's some that really were out of control.",
      "Time: So you will not include those who committed violent acts?",
      "Trump: Well, we're going to look at each individual case, and we're going to do it very quickly, and it's going to start in the first hour that I get into office. And a vast majority of them should not be in jail. A vast majority should not be in jail, and they've suffered gravely. And I say, why is it that in Portland and in many other places, Minneapolis, why is it that nothing happened with them and they actually caused death and destruction at levels not seen before? So you know, if you take a look at what happened in Seattle, you had people die, you had a lot of death, and nothing happened, and these people have been treated really, really badly. Yeah, it's an important issue for me. They've suffered greatly, and in many cases they should not have suffered.",

      "Trump says he didn't think Matt Gaetz's nomination was \"worth the fight\"",
      "Shortly after the election, Trump announced Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as his nominee for attorney general. Gaetz was previously investigated for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl, which he denied, and it soon became clear that he was unlikely to win confirmation in the Senate. He withdrew from consideration a week later.",
      "Trump told Time that he thought Gaetz would have eventually gotten the votes, but he didn't think it was worth the effort:",
      "Time: One of your nominees was effectively blocked by the Senate. There are other senators who have expressed doubts about some of your other nominees. What are you going to do if the Senate continues to balk at your choices for these key cabinet positions?",
      "Trump: Well, I don't think they will. And he wasn't blocked. I had the votes if I needed them, but I had to work very hard. And you know, I'm not \u2014 there were numerous hard no's, all of whom agreed with me to do it.",
      "Time: So you decided to give up on Gaetz?",
      "Trump: No, I didn't give up on him. I talked to him, and I said, you know, Matt, I don't think this is worth the fight.",
      "Asked whether he would use recess appointments to name heads of agencies without Senate confirmation, Trump said, \"I really don't care how they get them approved, as long as they get them approved,\" but also that it was \"up to the Senate.\"",
      "Trump says Harris should have given more interviews during the campaign",
      "Asked about Vice President Kamala Harris' missteps during the presidential race, Trump said she shouldn't have agreed to replace President Biden in the first place. He also said she made a mistake by not sitting for more interviews, pointing to his own willingness to speak to a variety of outlets and hosts:",
      "Time: Speaking of Kamala Harris. What do you think were her worst mistakes in the campaign?",
      "Trump: Taking the assignment. Number one, because you have to know what you're good at.",
      "Time: Did she make any tactical mistakes you think that cost her?",
      "Trump: I think that when she wouldn't talk to anybody, it shone a light on her. In other words, if she would have gone out and just did interviews where they're comparable to Steve [Cheung, Trump's communications director], if there is anybody comparable, would say, could you do an interview here? An interview there? You know, she didn't do anything. And people said, Is there something wrong with her? Why would they? I mean, I'm doing this interview with you. I did interviews with, if I had the time, anybody that would ask, I'd do interviews. I think the Joe Rogan interview, you know, that went on for almost three and a half hours.",
      "After some back and forth, he continued:",
      "Trump: But, but it's an interesting question when you ask about [Harris]. I think they made a big tactical mistake by literally not talking to the press, even if a really friendly, I mean, and they had almost all friendly, somebody would come up with a really friendly \u2014 like you guys, maybe \u2014 but a friendly interview, and they turned everybody down. They wouldn't do the basic. And people, including me, would start to say, is there something wrong with her? What's wrong? Why wouldn't you do some basic interviews? And then she had some pretty failed interviews, and maybe it was highlighted more than it would. In other words, if she did those same interviews, but she did another 15 interviews, you know, you wouldn't have really noticed it that much.",
      "Trump says releasing Project 2025 was \"totally inappropriate\"",
      "During the campaign, Democrats hammered Trump and other Republicans over Project 2025, a conservative effort to lay out a blueprint for a second Trump administration. Trump tried to distance himself from the final product, but many of its contributors worked in his first administration, and several have been named to powerful posts in his second term.",
      "Trump told Time he didn't read the group's work, and said its organizers shouldn't have released it during the campaign:",
      "Time: During the campaign, you disavowed Project 2025, but so far at least five people you've appointed to top positions in your Cabinet have ties to it. Doesn't that undermine what you told Americans on the campaign trail?",
      "Trump: No, look, I don't \u2014 I don't disagree with everything in Project 2025, but I disagree with some things. I specifically didn't want to read it because it wasn't under my auspices, and I wanted to be able to say that, you know, the only way I can say I have nothing to do with it is if you don't read it. I don't want \u2014 I didn't want to read it. I read enough about it. They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don't like. I won't go into individual items, but I had nothing to do with Project 2025. Now, if we had a few people that were involved, they had hundreds of them. This is a big document, from what I understand.",
      "Time: More than 800 pages.",
      "Trump: It's a lot of pages. That's a lot of pages. I thought it was inappropriate that they came out with it just before the election, to be honest with you.",
      "Time: Really?",
      "Trump: I let them know, yeah, I didn't think it was appropriate, because it's not me. Why would they do that? They complicated my election by doing it because people tried to tie me and I didn't agree with everything in there, and some things I vehemently disagreed with, and I thought it was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that prior to my election.",
      "Time: Did you express those frustrations with them?",
      "Trump: Oh I did. It wasn't a frustration, it was a fact. It's totally inappropriate. They come up with an 800-page document, and the enemy, which is, you know, the other party, is allowed to go through and pick out two items, 12 items out of, you know, 800. No, I thought it was an open \u2014 I thought it was a very foolish thing for them to do.",
      "Time: I understand, sir.",
      "Trump: These are people that would like to see me win. And yet, they came out with this document, and they had some pretty ridiculous things in there. They also had some very good things in there.",
      "Trump says transgender bathroom issue has \"ripped apart our country\"",
      "During the campaign, Trump spent tens of millions of dollars on a television ad that highlighted Harris' positions on transgender rights, specifically her support in 2019 for taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for inmates and immigrant detainees. \"Kamala's for they/them. President Trump is for you,\" the ad said.",
      "But in his interview with Time, Trump downplayed fights over transgender rights, particularly which bathroom transgender people are allowed to use, saying the issue has \"ripped apart our country\":",
      "Time: Can I shift to the transgender issue? Obviously, sort of a major issue during the campaign. In 2016, you said that transgender people could use whatever bathroom they chose. Do you still feel that way?",
      "Trump: When was that?",
      "Time: In 2016.",
      "Trump: I don't want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it's a very small number of people we're talking about, and it's ripped apart our country, so they'll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees. I am a big believer in the Supreme Court, and I'm going to go by their rulings, and so far, I think their rulings have been rulings that people are going along with, but we're talking about a very small number of people, and we're talking about it, and it gets massive coverage, and it's not a lot of people.",
      "Time: But on that note, there's a big fight on this in Congress now. The incoming trans member from Delaware, Sarah McBride, says we should all be focused on more important issues. Do you agree?",
      "Trump: I do agree with that. On that\u2014absolutely. As I was saying, it's a small number of people.",
      "Asked whether he would reverse the Biden administration's protections for trans children under Title IX, Trump said, \"I'm going to look at it very closely.\"",
      "Trump on using military for deportations: \"I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows\"",
      "Turning to immigration, the Time journalists noted that federal law prohibits using the military as law enforcement on U.S. soil. They asked Trump how that squares with his promise to use the military to facilitate his mass deportation plans:",
      "Time: You recently said on Truth Social that you plan to use the military to deport migrants. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. What will you do if the military does not or refuses to carry out your orders?",
      "Trump: Well, it doesn't, it doesn't stop the military if it's an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country. We have criminals coming into our countries that we've never seen, we've never seen before. We have people coming in at levels and at record numbers that we've never seen before. And I'll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help. We'll also get National Guard. We'll get National Guard, and we'll go as far as I'm allowed to go, according to the laws of our country.",
      "Trump says he thinks Musk \"puts the country long before his company\"",
      "Trump was asked about appointing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an advisory group aimed at recommending spending cuts across the federal government.",
      "Musk's various enterprises are regulated by or have contracts with federal agencies, raising the prospect that his work with DOGE would constitute a conflict of interest. Trump told Time he doesn't think it does:",
      "Time: You've put Elon Musk in charge of DOGE, giving him the power to \u2014",
      "Trump: Along with \u2014",
      "Time: Along with Vivek Ramaswamy, yes, absolutely. But on Musk specifically, giving him the power to oversee the agencies that regulate his companies. Isn't that a conflict of interest?",
      "Trump: I don't think so. Look, we have a country that is bloated with rules, regulations and with, frankly, people that are unnecessary to do. We are going to need a lot of people in a lot of other jobs. We're looking to get people into private sector jobs where they can do better and be more productive. We're going to see what happens. We have some interesting months coming up, at the beginning. We're going to see what happens. But this country is bloated.",
      "Time: I think everybody agrees that there's waste in the federal government\u2014",
      "Trump: Waste, fraud, and abuse.",
      "Time: But Elon Musk is talking about cuts that would directly affect NASA, which would then directly affect SpaceX, his company. Isn't that the textbook definition of a conflict of interest?",
      "Trump: I think that Elon puts the country long before his company. I mean, he's in a lot of companies, but he really is, and I've seen it. He considers this to be his most important project, and he wanted to do it. And, you know, I think, I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company.",
      "Trump on Ukraine: \"You can't reach an agreement if you abandon\"",
      "Trump has said he wants to broker a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, and has harshly criticized the tens of billions of dollars of aid the U.S. has sent Kyiv since Russia's invasion in 2022.",
      "Trump addressed fears from Democrats and European allies that he would abandon Ukraine or push the country to give up territory in any eventual peace deal:",
      "Time: The question that many Americans and many people around the world have is, Will you abandon Ukraine?",
      "Trump: I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon. You understand what that means, right?",
      "Time: Right. Well, no, tell me.",
      "Trump: Well, I just said it. You can't reach an agreement if you abandon, in my opinion. And I disagree with the whole thing, because it should have never happened. Putin would have never invaded Ukraine if I were president for numerous reasons. Number one, they drove up the oil price. When they drove up the oil price, they made it a profit-making situation for him, the oil price should have been driven down. If it was driven down, you wouldn't have had it wouldn't have started just for pure economic reasons. But when it hits $80, $85, and $90 a barrel. I mean, he made, he made a lot of money. I'm not saying it's a good thing, because he's also suffered, but they are moving forward. You know, this is a war that's been \u2014 this is a tragedy. This is death that's far greater than anyone knows. When the real numbers come out, you're going to see numbers that you're not going to believe.",

      "Trump addressed the volatile situation in the Middle East, specifically the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel. He said the Middle East is \"an easier problem to handle than what's happening with Russia and Ukraine\" and \"going to get solved.\"",

      "Time: Did Netanyahu give you assurances about when he would end the war?",
      "Trump: Um, I don't want to say that, but I think he feels confident that \u2014 I think he feels very confident in me, and I think he knows I want it to end. I want everything to end. I want, I don't want people killed, you know? I don't want people from either side killed, and that includes whether it's Russia, Ukraine, or whether it's the Palestinians and the Israelis and all of the, you know, the different entities that we have in the Middle East. There's so many different entities. But I don't want people killed.",
      "Time: When you say productive things are happening, can you be more specific?",
      "Trump: No, I can't. I mean, I'd love to be, I would so love to be, but I can't. I will be. We're going to sit down in a period of time, hopefully soon, and I'll tell you all the things that are happening. But there are some very productive things happening. I do think\u2014okay, because I'm looking at two, two primary fronts, right? You have the Russia-Ukraine, and you have this, and there are other problems also. But look, when North Korea gets involved, that's another element that's a very complicating factor. And I know Kim Jong Un, I get along very well with Kim Jong Un. I'm probably the only one he's ever really dealt with. When you think about it, I am the only one he's ever dealt with. But you have a lot of very bad complicating factors there, but we'll sit down and we'll at the end of each of these, or both, maybe simultaneously, we'll sit down and I'll show you what a good job I did.",
      "Time: You mentioned the Palestinian people. In your first term, your administration put forward the most comprehensive plan for a two-state solution in a long time. Do you still support that plan?",
      "Trump: I support a plan of peace, and it can take different forms. When I did the Abraham Accords, that should have been loaded up with people, you know. I made a statement. I think they didn't add one country. Think of it. They didn't add one country to the Abraham Accords. We had the four countries, very important countries, but that should have been loaded up with Middle Eastern countries.",
      "Time: Do you still support a two-state solution?",
      "Trump: I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.",
      "Does Trump trust Netanyahu? \"I don't trust anybody\"",

    "summary": "Allegations recently surfaced that Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn was soliciting financial payments in connection to efforts by potential appointees to secure government positions.",
    "story": [
      "Two top Senate Democrats are calling for President-elect Donald Trump's potential appointees to be required to disclose any communications they had with Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser, after allegations recently surfaced that Epshteyn was soliciting financial payments in connection to their efforts to secure government appointments.",
      "\"All nominees appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee should immediately act to retain all communications with Mr. Epshteyn, provide those materials to the Committee well in advance of their hearing date, and be prepared to testify regarding any discussions with Mr. Epshteyn about receiving a potential appointment in the incoming administration,\" Democratic Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island wrote in a letter shared with CBS News and the conservative publication Just the News.",
      "The letter was addressed to Republican Sens. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and also copied to Trump's transition team leader Susie Wiles. It asks that the senior Republicans require any Trump appointees who come before the Judiciary Committee for confirmation to \"preserve and produce to the Committee any communications with Mr. Epshteyn.\"",
      "The senators wrote that \"questions remain regarding whether any nominees made promises or other assurances to Mr. Epshteyn as a condition of his support.\"",
      "A transition source called the letter a \"pathetic Lawfare tactic.\"",
      "Epshteyn previously told CBS News he was honored to be working for President-elect Trump and that the allegations against him were patently false.",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "Graham's office said it would defer comment to Grassley, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Grassley said in a statement, \"Committee members will have the opportunity to ask nominees questions on these issues when they come before the Senate for a hearing.\"",
      "Late last month, the New York Times reported that attorney David Warrington, who will be Trump's incoming White House counsel, conducted a review into the allegations against Epshteyn and concluded that Epshteyn had solicited payment from at least two people. The Times reported that Warrington recommended that Trump keep his distance from Epshteyn.",
      "Last month, CBS News reported that Trump's transition team was grappling with internal strife over Epshteyn's conduct related to possible candidates for positions in the Trump administration. At least one Republican politician, former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, alleged in a sworn declaration to the transition team that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",

      "Stanley is recalling 2.6 million mugs sold in the U.S. after the company received dozens of consumer complaints, including some users who reported getting burned and requiring medical attention.",
      "The recall covers all Stanley Switchback and Trigger Action stainless steel travel mugs, which are double-walled mugs sold in a number of colors and sizes that came with a polypropylene lid, according to the recall notice posted Thursday by the Consumer Safety Product Commission. The Stanley logo, a winged bear with a crown, appears on the front and bottom of the mug.",
      "The company has received 91 reports worldwide about the lids coming loose while in use, leading to 38 burn injuries. The CSPC said 16 of the complaints stemmed from U.S. consumers, including 2 burn injuries.",
      "\"Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled travel mugs and contact Stanley to receive a free replacement lid, including shipping,\" the CSPC said in its statement.",
      "Stanley mugs have become a pop culture phenomenon, especially its mega-sized Stanley Adventure Quencher, which can hold up to 40 ounces of liquid. The current recall involves smaller travel mugs whose lid threads can shrink when encountering heat and torque, potentially causing the lid to detach while consumers are using the mugs.",
      "The recall comes after Stanley faced lawsuits earlier this year alleging the company failed to disclose their mugs are manufactured using some lead. In a statement on its website, Stanley said that while its manufacturing process includes \"some lead,\" those parts are \"are covered with a durable stainless-steel layer, making them inaccessible to consumers.\"",

    "summary": "Fast-food worker who provided crucial police tip is eligible for up to $60,000, but getting it will take time.",
    "story": [
      "More than 400 tips were called into the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line during the five-day search for a masked gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.",
      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after\u00a0the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money it awards individual tipsters. Similarly, the Crime Stoppers program doesn't release such details in an effort to protect tipsters' anonymity.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

    "story": [
      "It's not shaping up to be a very merry holiday season for some major retailers this year.",
      "U.S. retailers have announced more than 7,100 store closures through the end of November 2024, a 69% jump from the same time last year, according to recent data from research firm CoreSight. That comes as 45 retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection so far this year, compared with 25 retail bankruptcies for all of 2023, the report found.",
      "The surge in store closures comes at a time when consumer spending appears strong, helping to lift the nation's economic growth. Yet cracks are emerging, with some retailers reporting that inflation-weary shoppers are cutting back or becoming more choosy in searching for sales and deals.",
      "While retailers such as Walmart are finding ways of appealing to financially strapped shoppers, other chains are struggling. Target last month said its most recent quarterly earnings and sales fell short of forecasts. Family Dollar\u00a0and\u00a0CVS Health, which have struggled with economizing consumers, are among the companies with the largest number of closures.",
      "\"There is not enough growth in the retail market for every player to do well, which is why we are seeing polarized results,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst with GlobalData, told CBS MoneyWatch about this year's surge in store closures.",
      "He added, \"However, many of the chains closing stores are those that have problems which go beyond the economy. Their propositions might not be right, their offers might not be what consumers want, and they might not have responded to competitive threats in the right way.\"",
      "Which retailers are closing locations?",
      "Retailers with the largest number of store closures include discount chains and drugstores, according to CoreSight's data.",
      "Pharmacy closures are a long-term problem, with more than 7,000 closing since 2019, according to the Associated Press, citing data from the University of Pittsburgh. That's causing\u00a0pharmacy deserts\u00a0across regions in the U.S. where some residents don't have a nearby drugstore to fill prescriptions and get other health care products.",
      "Overall, the discount store category is growing, Saunders noted. Dollar General and Dollar Tree both announced hundreds of new store openings in 2024, CoreSight's research found. Yet Family Dollar, which has had widespread closures this year, has failed to attract price-sensitive shoppers while its stores offer \"a poor selling environment,\" Saunders said in a Dec. 4 research note.",
      "The retail landscape might stabilize next year, although there are likely to be additional closures in 2025, he added.",

    "summary": "FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told investigators that not canvassing the nation for further information was the \"basic step that was missed.\"",
    "story": [
      "A new report by the Justice Department inspector general found that the FBI failed to commission the dozens of FBI field offices across the country to gather information from its own confidential human sources ahead of the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, despite telling Congress that it had done so.",
      "Had the FBI's field office canvassed those sources, it \"could have helped the FBI and its law enforcement partners with their preparations in advance of January 6,\" the report said.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told investigators that not canvassing the nation for further information was the \"basic step that was missed.\"",
      "The inspector general determined the FBI's inaccurate reporting to Congress about the lack of field office coordination was not intentional.",
      "\"Our review of documented CHS reporting in FBI field offices as of January 6 did not identify any potentially critical intelligence related to a possible attack on the Capitol on January 6 that had not been provided to law enforcement stakeholders prior to January 6,\" the inspector general said.",
      "More than two dozen individuals utilized by the FBI as confidential human sources were in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, ahead of the Capitol breach, but none were authorized by their handlers to illegally enter the Capitol building or join the riot that day, the inspector general's report said.",
      "No undercover FBI agents or employees were found to have attended the Jan. 6 protests or taken part in the attack, the report said.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, revealed that federal investigators tasked just three of the 26 FBI sources in the city that day to gather information for domestic terrorism cases, and the remaining individuals were not directed to be there. In all, four confidential human sources entered the Capitol building during the riot and 11 were on restricted Capitol grounds.",
      "According to the Justice Department, confidential human sources are those \"believed to be providing useful and credible information to the FBI and whose identity, information, or relationship with the FBI warrants confidential handling.\" Federal investigators conventionally utilize these individuals to report on members of criminal organizations and provide information that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The use of confidential human sources around the time of the Jan. 6 Capitol breach has been a point of contention on Capitol Hill, and outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray has faced questions from Republican lawmakers about the practice.",
      "In the days after the riot, questions surfaced about the intelligence gathered ahead of the attack and whether it was properly acted upon by federal investigators. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the FBI correctly identified a potential for violence as Congress was set to certify the results of Joe Biden's 2020 victory over Donald Trump and took appropriate steps in preparation. The U.S. Capitol Police \u2014 not the FBI \u2014 led law enforcement efforts to protect the Electoral College certification that day, while other agencies provided support.",
      "On the eve of the riot, the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, issued a raw intelligence report warning of an anonymous social media thread threatening violence at the Capitol, CBS News previously reported. But, according to Capitol Police officials, that information was never shared with their agency. The FBI has defended its handling of the intelligence.",
      "\"Many of these 26 confidential human sources had provided information relevant to the January 6 Electoral Certification before the event and\u2026a few CHSs also provided information about the riot as it occurred,\" Horowitz wrote. The report revealed some sources were in contact or traveling with members of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, organizations whose leadership has since been convicted at trial of seditious conspiracy as a result of the attack.",
      "In response to the report, the FBI said it disagreed with \"certain factual assertions\u2026regarding the manner of specific steps, and the scope of the canvass undertaken by the FBI in advance of January 6, 2021.\"",
      "After the Capitol breach, the FBI launched one of the largest federal probes in American history, and prosecutors have since charged more than 1,500 defendants with crimes ranging from illegal entry into the Capitol building to assaulting police and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Nearly 1,000 of those charged have entered into plea deals with the Justice Department and admitted guilt. Another 200 have been convicted at trial before a judge or jury.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's report revealed that none of the FBI's confidential human sources who entered the Capitol or restricted grounds that day were among the hundreds criminally charged for doing so.",
      "In response to the report's findings, the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., which has spearheaded the Capitol breach investigation, said, \"The D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office generally has not charged those individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals; and we have treated the CHSs consistent with this approach.\"",
      "Despite President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to issue pardons for some of the defendants, federal prosecutors have continued to charge individuals for alleged crimes tied to the Capitol attack in the weeks after the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Some defendants and their legal teams have pushed for early release from prison or a pause in their proceedings ahead of Trump's inauguration. Federal judges overseeing the cases have mostly denied those requests. Advocates on behalf of the defendants have urged Trump to issue pardons.",
      "\"I'm going to be acting very quickly,\" Trump said earlier this week in an interview with NBC News. Trump has tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his nominee to lead the Justice Department.

    "summary": "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. Two lawsuits allege those bots harmed teen users.",
    "story": [
      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

    "story": [
      "The premier of Canada's most populous province on Wednesday threatened to cut off energy supplies to the U.S. if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposed tariffs on Canadian goods. This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",

      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",

      "Midwestern states in particular could face serious risks if Trump's plan for tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China goes into effect.\u00a0Michigan and Illinois rely heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which account for 19% and 12% of their state GDPs, respectively, according to analysts at Fitch Ratings Group. Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",

      "A California man who was charged with lying to the FBI about fake criminal allegations against President Biden and his son Hunter is pleading guilty, according to an agreement filed in federal court on Thursday.",
      "Alexander Smirnov was\u00a0indicted in February\u00a0by special counsel David Weiss, who was appointed to lead the now-defunct investigations into Hunter Biden. The president pardoned his son earlier this month.",
      "A longtime confidential informant, Smirnov told his FBI handler in 2020 that the two Bidens each accepted $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma several years earlier. The claims \"were false, as the Defendant knew,\" according to the charging documents filed against him.",

Weiss was appointed U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, and the Biden administration kept him on to continue his Hunter Biden probe.

He later became head of Adra Prison and brigadier general in 2005. In 2011, he was appointed governor of Deir ez-Zour, a region northeast of the Syrian capital of Damascus, where there were violent crackdowns against protesters.",

      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border.

      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",

Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",

According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 11:38:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The Georgian government's move away from the European Union and closer to Russia is fueling daily protests. Here's why it matters.",
    "story": [
      "Live television coverage showed police in the former Soviet republic of Georgia beating and arresting an opposition leader last week during a raid on his party's offices. The scenes played out on the 10th day of violent clashes in capital city Tbilisi between police and protesters furious about the Georgian prime minister's decision to put talks on joining the European Union on hold.",
      "The unrest that erupted two weeks ago, after months of public frustration over Georgia's future, has caused significant casualties and seen more than 400 people arrested.",
      "Over 100 people have been hospitalized with injuries sustained during clashes with riot police, but the protesters continue taking to the streets of Tbilisi by their thousands every night.",
      "As the protests continue, there's concern the political crisis could escalate into more widespread violence, and there's also concern that a key U.S. partner on the far eastern edge of Europe could shift its political tendencies away from the democratic West and toward Moscow \u2014 whether or not its people agree with the move. Below is a look at what led to the unrest, and why the political crisis in the country that straddles Europe and Asia matters to the wider world.",
      "What led to the protests in Georgia?",
      "The protests have been driven largely by what many Georgians see as the governing Georgian Dream party's increasing authoritarian tendencies. In power since 2012, the ruling party led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili initially promised democratic reforms and closer ties with Europe and the West, including the EU.",
      "Critics argue that over time, the party has shifted toward Russia, undermining many Georgians' aspirations to see their country join the EU.",
      "The government's decision to freeze EU accession talks, and before that, to adopt a controversial \"foreign agents\" bill similar to legislation in Russia, were both seen as clear evidence of that shift to the east by Georgia's ruling party. There were previous protests over the new law as it went through the approval process, with many fearing it will stifle civil society and media freedom in the country.",
      "The situation deteriorated in November following allegations of voter suppression and election fraud in parliamentary elections. The post-election protests, which grew in size and intensity, were fueled by opposition claims that the government was manipulating the democratic process.",
      "President Salome Zurabishvili, an independent politician, has been among the most vocal critics of the ruling Georgian Dream party over alleged election interference, calling the recent vote a \"total fraud.\" According to the Reuters news agency, two international polling groups from the U.S. agreed with that assessment, calling the results statistically impossible.",
      "On Dec. 3, the country's Constitutional Court rejected Zurabishvili's call to annul the parliamentary election results, further exacerbating the tension on the streets. On the ninth day of the protests she called the actions of the police gross violations of human rights in her post on X.",
      "Georgia's relationship with Russia",
      "The protests in Georgia have highlighted the country's complex, fraught relationship with its much larger neighbor to the north, Russia.",
      "Russia invaded Georgia in 2008\u00a0and it continues to occupy the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.",
      "Russia firmly opposes Georgia's aspirations to join both the EU and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance, and it has leveraged both its economic and political influence to try to prevent the country from aligning with the Western institutions.",
      "In an interview with 60 Minutes earlier this year President Zurabishvili called Russia's subtle, yet impactful bid to influence Georgian politics part of a \"hybrid war\" being waged by Moscow against the West.",
      "She said Russia's tactics included spreading disinformation, exerting economic pressure and manipulating internal politics to prevent Georgia from fully integrating with its European neighbors to the west.",
      "Critics, including the president, highlight the recent adoption of the foreign agents law, which requires all non-profit organizations and media outlets that receive foreign funding to register as \"foreign agents\" in Georgia, as an example of the ruling party dragging the country closer to Russia's authoritarian model.",
      "Similar laws in Russia, enacted since Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have been used to curb dissent and limit political freedom.",
      "Critics argue that the law represents a major setback for democratic reforms set in motion when Georgia gained its independence from the former Soviet Union, and it was always seen as a significant hurdle to EU membership.",
      "LGBTQ rights in Georgia have also been a contentious issue, with the ruling party and influential religious groups often opposing reforms. Discrimination against LGBTQ people remains widespread, and pride marches are regularly met with violent counterprotests.",
      "The social divide is another point of tension, as many pro-European activists see the protection of minority rights as an essential part of Georgia's future in the EU.",
      "Why does Georgia's political crisis matter to the U.S.?",
      "Georgia's political unrest has important implications for both the European Union and NATO, with Western capitals worried that a move toward Russia and its style of authoritarianism could embolden Moscow as it tries to curb Western influence across the continent.",
      "Georgia has been a critical partner to the U.S. in the South Caucasus region, which straddles the border between Eastern Europe and Asia. If Georgia's government continues shifting its alignment toward Russia, it could undermine U.S. influence.",
      "\"Political crisis in Georgia is a significant challenge for the West,\" Royal United Services Institute associate fellow Natia Seskuria told CBS News. \"Georgia has remained one of the most pro-Western countries in the region, with an overwhelming majority of the population supporting the country's integration into the EU and NATO.\"",
      "Seskuria said the lack of any significant international response to the unrest was likely deepening and prolonging the crisis.",
      "The U.S. State Department suspended its strategic partnership with Georgia at the end of November, citing the country's shift away from European integration.",
      "\"The Georgian people overwhelmingly support integration with Europe,\" the State Department said when it suspended the partnership, adding a condemnation of \"the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest.\u00a0 We call on all sides to ensure protests remain peaceful.\"",

      "The United Kingdom indefinitely extended a ban on puberty blockers for people younger than 18, barring medication prescriptions used to treat gender dysphoria, the government announced this week. There will be exemptions for people who choose to participate in a clinical trial aiming to study the safety and effectiveness of puberty suppression, which is set to begin next year. Young people already prescribed puberty blockers are allowed to continue taking them, the government said.",
      "Britain's health secretary, Wes Streeting, announced the decision Wednesday.

In March, Britain's National Health Service stopped routine prescriptions of puberty blocking drugs to children and teenagers under 18 at clinics, in response to a landmark review of the country's approach to gender identity in health care.",
      "That review, conducted by a leading U.K. pediatrician, Dr. Hilary Cass, found insufficient evidence confirming puberty blockers were safe for young people. Cass reiterated that they \"should only be prescribed following a multi-disciplinary assessment and within a research protocol.\" She described the medications as \"powerful drugs with unproven benefits and significant risks\" in a statement responding to the health secretary's announcement.",

      "A male humpback whale made one of the longest and most unusual migrations on record for the species, an anomaly scientists say might be linked to climate change.",
      "The whale was first sighted in waters off northwestern Colombia in July 2013, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal\u00a0Royal Society Open Science on the creature's movements and how to potentially explain them. Authors said that same whale was seen again four years later, in another spot off the Colombian coast about 50 miles away from the location of the first sighting.",
      "An unlikely third encounter with the humpback happened in August 2022, when it was spotted off eastern Africa in a channel between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. The whale would have had to cross multiple oceans and travel more than 8,000 miles from the Colombian Pacific to get there, and experts believe it was trying to find a mate or food. The whale's lengthy voyage set a record for the longest known migration between breeding grounds.",
      "Sightings were tracked through photographs submitted by citizen scientists to happywhale.com, where marine enthusiasts, researchers and other professionals plot the locations and movements of whales worldwide.",
      "Though humpbacks are among several species of whales known to\u00a0migrate extraordinarily long distances\u00a0each year to pursue sources of food in colder waters and breed in tropical seas, the study's authors called the humpback's behavior \"atypical.\" This whale's crusade dwarfed even the longest transits reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which notes in a description of humpback whales shared on its site that some populations are known to migrate as far as 5,000 miles in a single year.",
      "The study said the long-distance movement was peculiar \"and raises the question as to what its drivers are, which could include but not necessarily be limited to mating strategies.\"",
      "The whale's penchant to explore an unexpected and faraway habitat could also have been rooted in environmental shifts caused by climate change, the authors said. Things like higher sea surface temperatures are impacting marine life around the world and could similarly affect distributions of krill in certain areas, which could in turn affect feeding grounds for humpbacks like the long-distance traveler.",
      "Their study did note that more research is necessary to arrive at any conclusions about the whale's migration pattern.",
      "\"On the other hand, population increases may also be a driver of these breeding ground shifts, when animals may need to explore new breeding and/or feeding areas due to competition from larger, more established males in both areas,\" the authors wrote. \"The exact cause or drivers of these breeding habitat shifts can only be speculated due to the current limited data availability on humpback whale behavioural ecology.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement.

      "When archaeologists unearthed the sunken ship, they discovered a hull built using an \"on-the-shell\" construction technique, a simplistic early shipbuilding method often traced to populations around the Mediterranean.

      "Haqqani was the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, the late founder of the notorious Haqqani network. The closely affiliated group was responsible for some of the most violent attacks during the Taliban's two-decade insurgency in the wake of the U.S.-led 2001 invasion to topple the previous Taliban government.

      "\"Italian tourism is under attack. The 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics and the 2025 Jubilee whet the appetites of the mafia,\" Demoskopika president Raffaele Rio said in a report.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law declaration, officials said Wednesday, as President Yoon Suk Yeol's office resisted a police attempt to search the compound.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party is pushing for a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 decree that imposed martial law in South Korea for the first time in more than four decades. Its first impeachment attempt against Yoon last Saturday failed after ruling party lawmakers boycotted the vote. The party said it plans to submit the new motion on Thursday to set up another vote this Saturday.",
      "Yoon's ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy and rattled financial markets. On Wednesday, rival North Korea's state media for the first time reported about the turmoil across the border, but the country hasn't shown any suspicious activities.",
      "Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers that former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun tried to kill himself the previous night at a detention center in Seoul. He said correctional officers stopped him and that he was in stable condition. Kim was arrested by prosecutors early Wednesday on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. He became the first person formally arrested over the martial law decree.",
      "Kim, one of Yoon's close associates, has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and they unanimously rejected Yoon's decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4.",
      "Kim said in a statement on Tuesday that he \"deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety\" to the public. He said all responsibility for the martial law imposition rests with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it.",
      "Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict Kim.",
      "Later Wednesday, police detained National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of Seoul's metropolitan police. They were accused of deploying police forces to parliament to block lawmakers from voting.",
      "The focus of the investigation is determining whether Yoon, Kim and others involved in imposing martial law committed the act of rebellion. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death in South Korea.",
      "South Korean police said they sent officers to search Yoon's office Wednesday to look for any evidence related to the martial law introduction. But investigators had failed to enter the office as of Wednesday evening, about six hours after their arrival, senior police officer Lee Ho-young told the parliament. Some observers earlier said the presidential security service was unlikely to permit any searches of Yoon's office, citing a law that prohibits searches of sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of the areas in question.",
      "Yoon on Saturday apologized over the martial law decree, saying he wouldn't avoid legal or political responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "The leader of Yoon's ruling party later vowed to arrange the president's stable exit from office, saying the party would coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon would be sidelined from duties. The comments were criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional, and caused widespread questions about who is in charge of South Korea and its military at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. The Justice Ministry on Tuesday banned Yoon from leaving the country as he faces investigations.",
      "Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho reiterated Wednesday that Yoon remains in charge of the military. But Yoon hasn't been involved in any major official activities since lifting martial law, except for accepting resignation offers by officials involved in the martial law case and appointing the head for the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
      "A Wednesday article from the North's state news agency reported about the South Korean political chaos and protests triggered by Yoon's martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events, though it called Yoon \"a traitor\" and his military \"gangsters.\"",
      "Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on major anti-government protests in foreign countries, because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events. The U.S. State Department said Monday that the U.S.-South Korean alliance remains \"iron-clad\" and that Washington is committed to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula.",
      "In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,\" a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife.",
      "Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergency situations, but South Korea wasn't in such a predicament. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn't allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required.",

    "summary": "The sound of a bottle popping may be a familiar harbinger of good, but the humble material behind the pop has more uses than you might imagine.",
    "story": [
      "Lisbon, Portugal \u2014\u00a0The sound of a cork popping out of the end of a bottle is known across the world. It often precedes moments of celebration, a shared meal or simply the quiet enjoyment of a glass of wine. But many who've taken part in the simple ritual may not realize that it's also a synonym for sustainability, natural wonder, and even human ingenuity.",
      "Cork, the humble material used for centuries to seal bottles, is a unique product not only for the way it's grown, but also for the plethora of inventive uses people have found for it \u2014 which go far beyond the ubiquitous bottle stoppers. Cork is used in everything from the building of spacecraft to the insulation of homes, and it can replace rubber or plastic on just about anything that needs protection from heat or vibration.",
      "Thanks to the unique, delicate conditions in which it grows, cork is also a powerful, natural carbon sink, meaning it absorbs harmful CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it away.",
      "CBS News visited the southern European nation of Portugal, which produces the majority of the world's cork, and met Ant\u00f3nio Rios Amorim, who humbly rejects the title \"King of Cork.\"",
      "\"I'm just inheriting a huge legacy from a family that, for the last 154 years, has been dedicating itself to cork, and really trying to develop this unique product to give it new life,\" he said.",
      "Amorim Cork produces more than five billion of the approximately 13 billion cork bottle stoppers produced annually across the globe. It's enough to give the family firm comfortable supremacy in the industry, but Amorim said finding new and innovative uses for the material, beyond sealing bottles, remained \"fundamental\" to his empire's future.",
      "Among the less-well-known applications \u2014 and one Amorim clearly relishes \u2014 is the use of cork on NASA rockets. The material is mixed into the heat shields that protect spacecraft as they leave and reenter the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Its light weight, malleability and insulating properties against vibration have made the spongy material a natural choice for some of the most important space missions, including the Apollo missions and the Mars rovers. It's also used on Elon Musk's SpaceX rockets.",
      "\"It's remarkable,\" said Eduardo Soares, as he gave CBS News a tour of Amorim's eclectic showroom. \"Cork has this very peculiar effect, a slow burning process. It will absorb heat without transferring it.\"",
      "As head of the unit tasked with dreaming up new ways for Amorim to profit from cork that isn't suitable for bottle stoppers, Soares could easily identify every product in the room.",
      "Biodegradable cork granules replace rubber in artificial turf infill, which also helps keep surface temperatures down and avoids the release of microplastics; Insulation panels that absorb vibration, making train carriages quieter and smoother; Children's playground flooring, normally made of synthetic materials, now have a natural alternative.",
      "For Amorim, the list of alternative uses for cork seems endless.",
      "\"It's very important for us that we use the raw material that we take out from nature until the very last limit,\" Soares explained.",
      "Amorim is also part of a recycling initiative, aptly named The Cork Collective, that aims to help restaurants and hotels recycle the cork stoppers from bottles they open, to give the precious material a new lease of life.",
      "Another family-run business in the field is Sofalca, which specializes in turning cork into natural insulation for walls and floors.",
      "CEO Paulo Estrada gave CBS News a tour of his factory's autoclaves, affectionately nicknamed the \"popcorn makers,\" which cook granules of cork at high temperatures and under intense pressure. The cork expands, and its natural resin glues it all together without the need for added chemicals. A large block rolls off the assembly line, ready to be cut into slabs, shaped into enormous walls of art or even pieces of furniture.",
      "Estrada said the material can give an otherwise unassuming part of someone's home a \"contemplative effect.\"",
      "\"If you come near a cork wall, you will touch, smell and feel it. Nobody stays indifferent,\" he added.",
      "The desire by businesses to make the most out of every single ounce of the natural material can be explained by its biggest caveat: Cork is a layer of bark that grows only on the Quercus Suber oak tree. It typically takes 25 years from the moment a tree is planted for it to be ready for its first harvest. It then takes another nine years to regrow the bark.",
      "\"You have to be patient,\" said Casimiro Milheiras, taking a quick break from climbing up trees with a small axe. At 57, Milheiras is one of thousands of seasonal workers hired every summer to comb through Portugal's scorching Alentejo region to manually strip the bark off the Quercus oaks.",
      "\"It's almost an art form, so you only do this work if you really love it,\" he said.",
      "His 20 years of experience have taught him exactly how to strike the tree hard enough to pierce through the bark, but not so hard that he cuts into the trunk, as doing so would compromise the next harvest.",
      "The natural landscape cork comes from isn't just important for the industry, however. Environmental impact studies by international consulting firms EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers have demonstrated that many of Amorim's products are actually carbon negative, which means the overall process \u2014 from growth to extraction, transportation and production \u2014 absorbs more carbon than it emits into the environment.",
      "\"There is no best example of a carbon sink in a forest like the cork oak forest, because we don't cut the tree,\" explained Nuno Oliveira, \"we want them to grow [for] as long as possible.\"",
      "Oliveira is the director of Amorim's forestry division, which is responsible for the research and practices that keep its cork oak forests healthy. His work helps secure the future of both Portugal's cork industry, and the company.",
      "Standing in a field of planted cork oaks that were about 100 years old on average, Oliveira explained that as long as the trees keep growing and regrowing their precious bark, they will keep sucking carbon out of the air.",
      "His biggest challenge, he said, has been to find a way to shorten the time needed for a tree's first cork harvest from the current 25 years, to just 10, which CEO Amorim highlighted as one of the most \"fundamental\" questions his business needs to answer.",
      "\"This is a gift of nature,\" Amorim said. \"We need to consume products with a negative carbon footprint. That means we are going to have to plant a lot more cork trees, which at the end of the day will make us live in a much better world.\"",

    "summary": "The Arctic tundra has historically helped reduce global emissions. But rising temperatures and wildfires in the region are changing that, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Foreboding environmental milestones abounded again this year in the Arctic, where experts say dramatic climate shifts are fundamentally altering the ecosystem and how it operates. One recent turning point for the region involves its carbon footprint: Where conditions in the Arctic historically worked to reduce global emissions, they're now actively contributing to them.",
      "That's a major transition that could reap consequences on human, plant and animal life far beyond Earth's northernmost arena, warned a cohort of scientists whose research appears in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2024 Arctic Report Card, published Tuesday. The report is an annual assessment of the polar environment, which in recent years has become a stark alert signal marked by unprecedented and ominous observations all linked to rising temperatures from human-caused climate change.",
      "A focus of the latest Arctic evaluation was the effects of warmer weather and wildfires on the tundra, a far-northern biome that's typically known for extreme cold, little precipitation and a layer of permanently frozen soil, called permafrost, covering the land. Those traits collectively made the Arctic an important carbon sink for millennia, meaning the region essentially helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide by absorbing more carbon than it emitted into the atmosphere.",
      "That has mainly been due to carbon uptake from plants, which regulate atmospheric levels of the molecule through photosynthesis, and a storage process in the permafrost, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground. But warming air temperatures in the Arctic are breaking down permafrost across the tundra, in some cases, severely. The Arctic report, for example, showed Alaskan permafrost temperatures in 2024 were the second-warmest ever recorded. That causes the soil to heat up and thaw, its carbon repositories decompose along with it.",
      "Research included in NOAA's Arctic report shows carbon once stored in the tundra's permafrost is actually being released into the atmosphere. In parts of the region, it's happening at a rate that outweighs the carbon sink and instead creates a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 something of particular concern to climate scientists at a time when pollution from fossil fuel production has already reached a record high.",
      "The same fossil fuels overwhelming the atmosphere and prompting ongoing admonition from top weather and climate officials\u00a0at the United Nations are fueling the emissions in the Arctic, said Rich Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA, in a statement on the new report's findings.",
      "\"Our observations now show that the Arctic tundra, which is experiencing warming and increased wildfire, is now emitting more carbon than it stores, which will worsen climate change impacts,\" Spinrad said. \"This is yet one more sign, predicted by scientists, of the consequences of inadequately reducing fossil fuel pollution.\"",
      "Wildfires in the Arctic have been raging at rates never seen before, and that alone drives up carbon emissions. Researchers suggest 2024 had the second-highest annual volume of wildfire emissions north of the Arctic Circle on record. Coupled with the release of carbon dioxide and methane gas from permafrost stores, they say net emissions could continue to increase in the place that climate change is heating up faster than anywhere else on the planet.",

    "story": [
      "Damascus \u2013 Syria's capital city was on auto-pilot Tuesday, with no new government in place in the wake of the dramatic rebel offensive that toppled longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. But as the former al-Qaeda offshoot that led that charge put some of its senior figures in charge of a self-declared transitional administration, many Syrians appeared determined to try to get on with business as usual.",
      "Some institutions, including Syria's central bank, asked employees to show up for work, and many people appeared to be hoping that just sticking to daily routines would prove the safest option in the face of complete uncertainty over the country's future.",
      "Some efforts are being made to quell concern. Mohamed al-Bashir, a politican who previously led local government in the parts of northwestern Syria and Idlib ruled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, before its extraordinary 12-day lightening offensive, has been named a transitional prime minister for the next three months.",
      "And while there remains lingering anxiety, there was still an excited buzz, especially in the capital Damascus, which until Sunday was the seat of the Assad family's brutal grip on power for half a century. On Monday, crowds came to sightsee around one of the former dictator's houses and to get to know the Islamist fighters who swept into their city on Sunday.",
      "Those rebel forces, while patrolling the streets, were on their best behavior -\u2014 even allowing members of the public to hold their weapons for smiling photo opportunities.",
      "\"It's a celebration for all of us, for all the Syrians: here and all over the world,\" said Lina Zacchar, one of the many Syrians who came to take a look at the former president's family home. \"My mum is Christian, so she is afraid. But we are telling her... we hope for a new Syria. We are all brothers, we are all sisters, we are all one! We are Syrians.\"",
      "At another symbol of the regime, the presidential palace, members of the public walked the vast ceremonial rooms where the Assads once welcomed dignitaries.",
      "The idea of getting anywhere near the palace would have once been unimaginable for the general population. Now, its doors are wide open.  CBS News found the palace patrolled by a rebel soldier named Ahmed who had nearly been killed opposing Assad's forces nine years ago.",
      "\"I was personally targeted and I was wounded in a strike in 2015 on our home. My relatives are detained and I don't know their destiny,\" Ahmed told CBS News on Monday. \"They might be in the regime prisons and I hope we can release them from it.\"",
      "Ahmed \u2013 like all of the other rebel fighters \u2013  is waiting for new orders. There remains a huge question mark over HTS's efforts to gain political legitimacy, tarnished by a questioned human rights records in the areas of Syria in which it has governed, and lingering doubts about the faction's ability to heal the country's religious divides.",
      "Parts of the country also remains ravaged by war as Turkey-backed opposition fighters battle U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group and its extremist ideology remains active in pockets of the country.",
      "As Syria undergoes a seismic transition, the country is in a historic, but still dangerous, moment.",

      "Fentanyl has made headlines for driving overdose deaths, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning of the rise of an even deadlier drug.",
      "Last year, nearly 70% of all U.S. overdose deaths were attributed to illegally manufactured fentanyls (IMFs). One of those was carfentanil, an altered version of fentanyl that is said to be 100 times more potent, the CDC warned in a Dec. 5 alert.",
      "Deaths from carfentanil rose by more than 700% in the past year, according to the same source \u2014 there were 29 deadly overdoses between January and June 2023, and 238 in that same time frame in 2024.",

      "\"Very small amounts can produce thousands of doses,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Synthetic opioids like carfentanil are relatively easy to manufacture in illicit labs,\" Tuell went on. \"Since the drug is a synthetic, it is easier to produce \u2014 unlike heroin, which is dependent on a plant like opium.\"",

      "\"Even a small amount can be fatal, as it can cause respiratory failure,\" he said.",
      "Carfentanil can sometimes be in the form of \"pressed pills\" that resemble prescription medications, the expert said. (iStock)",
      "One of the major concerns with carfentanil and fentanyl is that they are frequently mixed with other drugs, such as benzodiazepines, cocaine and opioids, which can lead to accidental overdoses, according to Tuell.",

      "\"Even a tiny amount can increase the potency of a drug mixture, leading to a stronger and longer-lasting high.\"",
      "Carfentanil often appeals to drug users who have a high tolerance to opioids because they seek a stronger substance, \"making the drug attractive despite the risk,\" Tuell noted.",
      "How is the drug administered?",
      "Carfentanil can be injected and is frequently mixed with other opioids or heroin, Tuell said. In a powder form, it can be inhaled.",
      "\"Inhaling the drug can be quickly risky because it can enter the bloodstream, resulting in an overdose,\" Tuell warned. \"This can happen intentionally or accidentally, as the drug can become easily airborne.\"",

      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",

      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",

      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson discusses how Chinese cyber espionage targets U.S. telecoms to steal Americans&apos; information.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "U.S. telecom giants are under constant attack from Chinese hackers. A federal investigation has uncovered a massive cyber espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed that at least eight U.S. telecom companies have been affected by this hacking spree.",
      "To combat this, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have released advice for telecom companies to help them detect and block the hackers while preventing future attacks. I break down the details of this Chinese hacking campaign and share tips on how to keep your data safe.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2013 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the China hacking campaign",
      "According to the FBI, hackers linked to Beijing have infiltrated the networks of \"multiple\" telecom companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" Since this is an espionage campaign, they\u2019re not interested in the average Joe\u2019s texts or call history. Instead, their targets are Americans involved in government and politics.",
      "The hackers also tried to copy \"certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,\" according to the FBI. This suggests they might have been attempting to breach programs like those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows U.S. spy agencies to monitor the communications of individuals suspected of working for foreign powers.",
      "Earlier this month, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger shared new details about the scale of the Chinese hacking campaign. According to Neuberger, the U.S. believes the hackers managed to access communications from senior government officials and prominent political figures.",
      "She explained that while the hackers were focused on a relatively small group of individuals, a limited number of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts were compromised. Neuberger also mentioned that the affected telecom companies are working to address the breaches, but none have been able to completely remove the Chinese hackers from their networks yet.",
      "This campaign is believed to have started a year or two ago, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. Authorities suspect a Chinese hacking group known as Salt Typhoon to be behind the operation.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How are hackers able to access sensitive information?",
      "Salt Typhoon managed to access call records and private communications by exploiting decades-old back doors in major telecom providers, including AT&T and Verizon, experts believe.",
      "\"The irony here is that the back doors exploited by the Chinese are, in fact, the same back doors that are utilized by federal law enforcement for purposes of conducting legal surveillance,\" John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a data-centric security company, told CyberGuy.",
      "The vulnerabilities are a result of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a federal law that mandates back doors in critical telecommunications infrastructure. CALEA enables law enforcement agencies to access phone records and metadata, including facilitating wiretaps, as part of authorized investigations.",
      "\"The problem with back doors is simple. They're not selective. A back door created for law enforcement is, by its very nature, a vulnerability in the system. And vulnerabilities, once they exist, can be exploited by anyone who discovers them. Both good guys and bad guys can enter back doors,\" said Ackerly, who previously served as a White House technology adviser.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "The solution is end-to-end encryption",
      "To protect private conversations and phone calls, cybersecurity experts recommend using end-to-end encrypted platforms. Jeff Greene, executive assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA, urged Americans to prioritize encrypted communication tools.",
      "\"Use your encrypted communications where you have it,\" Greene advised, emphasizing the importance of secure platforms. He added, \"We definitely need to do that, kind of look at what it means long term, how we secure our networks.\"",
      "An FBI official warned that citizens should be \"using a cellphone that automatically receives timely operating system updates, responsibly managed encryption and phishing resistant MFA for email, social media and collaboration tool accounts.\"",
      "However, cybersecurity experts warn that these measures are not foolproof. The term \"responsibly managed encryption\" is problematic, as it intentionally leaves room for \"lawful access,\" such as the back doors required by CALEA.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that encryption with back doors is not actually responsible at all,\" Ackerly said. \"It\u2019s time for the U.S. government to acknowledge and support end-to-end encryption as a stronger protection against foreign adversaries.\"",

      "10 ways to protect your personal information against cybersecurity threats",
      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "9) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "10) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no denying that the U.S. is facing a serious cyberattack that puts millions at risk. What\u2019s even more concerning is that hackers continue to exploit telecom providers even after the issue has been made public. The government and the affected companies must prioritize addressing this threat and patching the back doors these cybercriminals are using. We\u2019re witnessing one of the largest intelligence compromises in U.S. history.",

      "3) Do not provide remote access: Never give control of your device to unsolicited callers.",
      "4) Run a security scan using strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential tech support scam. These services locate and remove your personal information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",

    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN? Should you install it on each device or run it on your home network through a router? We will break down the pros and cons of both methods to help you make the right decision.",

      "Woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN. This means every device connected to your Wi-Fi \u2013 whether a smartphone, laptop, gaming console or even a smart TV \u2013 automatically uses the VPN, even if that device doesn\u2019t support VPN apps.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Why use a VPN router?",
      "There are several advantages to running a VPN directly on your router.",
      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",
      "DON'T TOSS YOUR OLD INTERNET ROUTER UNTIL YOU DO THIS",
      "How to set up a VPN on a router",
      "Setting up a VPN on your\u00a0router may seem complex, but it significantly enhances your digital security, especially when paired with a robust router. Here\u2019s how to approach this process.",
      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "WHY YOU SHOULD BE USING A VPN TO SAFEGUARD YOUR STOCK TRADING ACTIVITIES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Both VPN routers and VPN apps have their own strengths, and the right choice depends on your specific needs. A VPN router might be the way to go if you\u2019re looking for convenience and whole-home protection. But if you prefer flexibility and more control over individual devices, sticking with a VPN app might suit you better.

      "1. Check all of your cable connections",
      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in. It would be best to try using a different electrical outlet to first rule out any electrical issues in your home.",
      "If you feel comfortable opening up your desktop PC, you can also go inside the case and ensure all your PCI connections are firmly plugged in.

      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",

      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",

      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume.

While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor.

      "What is scambaiting?",
      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch. Instead of falling for their sneaky tricks, scambaiters play along, knowing it's a scam, and take on the role of a potential victim to keep the scammers busy. But get this \u2014 there's now some new technology to do the scambaiting for you.",

      "TOP 10 ROBOCALL HOTSPOTS IN AMERICA",
      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "That's Daisy, an artificial intelligence-powered grandma developed by Virgin Media O2 to interact with scammers. When a scam call comes in, Daisy automatically answers and engages the caller in conversation, wasting their time. With her friendly personality and quick thinking, she keeps them on the line while gathering useful information about their tactics.\u00a0Daisy combines various AI models that work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously. She's so lifelike that she has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers' biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims.",
      "Now, before you get too excited, Daisy is currently only available for customers of Virgin Media O2 in the U.K., but other companies in the U.S. are beginning to offer similar AI-driven solutions. For instance,\u00a0Apate.ai has developed AI.Callee, which engages scammers in real-time conversations across various channels. Another U.S. company,\u00a0Scamnetic, has launched an AI-based scam-detection solution that can be integrated into enterprise platforms to protect consumers from various types of scams.",

      "Protecting yourself from robocall scams",
      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "The introduction of AI-powered scambaiters like Daisy marks a new era in the fight against fraud. While it's entertaining to imagine scammers being outwitted by a chatty AI grandma, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to protect vulnerable individuals from falling victim to these schemes. As technology evolves, so do the tactics of scammers, making it crucial for everyone to stay informed and vigilant.

Tulsi Gabbard, Trump\u2019s controversial pick to serve as the nation\u2019s top intelligence official, struck a drastically different tone on Syria in the wake of the fall of the country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard, a Democrat-turned-Republican and military veteran, has faced criticism over her past support for Assad, including making an unsanctioned trip to meet with him in 2017 that has come under renewed scrutiny.",
      "\u201cI stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statement President Trump has made over the last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,\u201d she told reporters Tuesday as she met with senators, many of whom are skeptical of her past controversial foreign policy views.",
      "Trump has said the United States should avoid involvement in Syria, posting on social media, \u201cThis is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved.\u201d",
      "Alexa Henning, a spokesperson for the transition, said that \"Lt. Col. Gabbard is in lockstep with President Trump and his statements on the events in Syria over the weekend. This is why President Trump was re-elected to prevent endless wars and put America First.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick for defense secretary, seems to be softening on his previous stance that women should not serve in combat roles, a position that came under scrutiny after Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, expressed skepticism about his selection. Ernst became the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate when she took office in 2015.",
      "On Monday, after her second meeting with him (and amid huge pressure from Trump supporters), Ernst issued a statement that Hegseth \u201ccommitted\u201d to \u201cselecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and values of our servicemen and women.\u201d Later that night on Fox News, Hegseth signaled to host Sean Hannity that he was backtracking on his initial position, praising female troops.",
      "\u201cSome of our greatest warriors, our best warriors out there are women who serve, raise their right hand to defend this country and love our nation, want to defend the flag, and they do it every single day around the globe,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s a contradiction from the blunt statement Hegseth made on the same network in November, when he said \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have women in combat roles\u201d as he promoted his book \u201cThe War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of Men Who Keep Us Free.\u201d",
      "Ernst has not yet said whether she will support Hegseth\u2019s nomination. But the Iowa Republican has said she looks forward to his Senate hearing, and in her statement Monday, she echoed Trump talking points attacking anonymous sources, like the current and former Fox employees who told NBC News they had concerns about Hegseth\u2019s drinking. (The Trump transition called the allegations \u201ccompletely unfounded and false.\u201d)",
      "\u201cAs I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources,\u201d Ernst said.",
      "A Trump transition official said that like Trump, \"Pete wants to see the U.S. military focus on being the world\u2019s strongest fighting force \u2014 not on cultural and social issues. Bottom line: If you can meet the standards, you can serve.\"",
      "Presidential nominees adjusting some of their positions to get Senate support is nothing new. But because several of Trump\u2019s picks had pre-existing star power, driven in part by controversial statements made in regular appearances on conservative media, this course correction may be more pronounced.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about deal making, it always has been. That\u2019s the politics of this process,\u201d said a veteran Republican operative and Trump ally. \u201cThese guys are well known. Many of them are kind of celebrities within the MAGA base and their positions helped make them that, so when they do what they need to to get confirmed, it\u2019s going to stand out.\u201d",
      "Yet, while Trump\u2019s Senate-confirmable picks must work with Republican senators who might not share their worldview, others given massive power and public platforms by the president-elect have been free to push their agendas with little worry of political repercussions \u2014 even if, at times, it complicates things for Trump and his allies.",
      "The DOGE experiment is the best example.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy face no external threat or political check as they push forward on their promise to recommend $2 trillion in federal spending cuts \u2014 a dynamic that has forced senators to meet with them and lobby for their preferred cuts. It has also exposed those senators to questions about some of the more controversial proposals, most notably entitlement spending cuts.",
      "Trump said during the campaign \u2014 and echoed in recent weeks \u2014 that cuts to programs like Social Security are off the table. He has sometimes talked about scouring that program and others for \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse,\u201d but he\u2019s also told supporters that he wouldn\u2019t \u201ccut one penny\u201d from entitlements.",
      "\u201cI said to people we\u2019re not touching Social Security, other than we make it more efficient,\u201d Trump said during an interview Sunday with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBut the people are going to get what they\u2019re getting.\u201d",
      "Of course, what looks like efficiency to one person or party could look different to another. And the DOGE architects have done little to tamp down chatter that those sort of cuts, which once seemed unthinkable for elected leaders, remain in play.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has also recently talked about reforms to Social Security; earlier this month, he wrote a 25-post thread on X delving into his criticism of the origins of the program.",
      "The posts got lots of attention, including from Musk. \u201cInteresting thread,\u201d he replied.",
      "Talk of cuts to those programs in the past would have spelled political suicide, but Trump offering wide-ranging authority to DOGE has helped provide cover for some budget-hawks who have long eyed entitlement reforms as part of broader-based government spending cuts.",
      "\u201cWe have got to right the ship, and it\u2019s going to mean cuts. It\u2019s going to mean cuts to the 24% of the discretionary spending that we have and it\u2019s going to mean looking long-term at the front end of programs like Social Security and Medicare\u201d Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., told Fox News on Monday. \u201cNot taking anyone off what they paid into so far, but there is some waste, abuse and fraud in Medicare that we can take those numbers back and add to our general coffers.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd on the front end on Social Security, I think there is a way, when people are living longer, they are retiring later, that on the front end, we can move that retirement age back a little bit,\u201d Alford added.",
      "A senior Senate Republican aide said early conversations around DOGE have not broached Social Security funding, with the early thinking around the advisory committee\u2019s purpose centered on streamlining government output rather than seeking outright cuts to services.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re more looking at now, from what I\u2019ve heard, is looking at ways to streamline these products and save money, rather than outright cutting anything,\u201d this person said.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.C., a veteran of decades of Washington\u2019s nastiest fights, instinctively knew not to touch the third rail when, after a meeting Wednesday with Musk and Ramaswamy, reporters asked Thune if DOGE\u2019s recommendations could include cutting entitlement programs.",
      "The senator laughed and walked away."

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Many people have a tiny slice of Neanderthal DNA, evidence of interbreeding between the species and ancient human ancestors.Two new studies suggest that interbreeding occurred during a limited period of time as ancient humans left Africa.Clarifying that timeline narrows the possible range of time when humans spread to new continents.",
      "Many people have a tiny slice of Neanderthal DNA, evidence of interbreeding between the species and ancient human ancestors.",
      "Two new studies suggest that interbreeding occurred during a limited period of time as ancient humans left Africa.",
      "Clarifying that timeline narrows the possible range of time when humans spread to new continents.",
      "Hidden in many people\u2019s genetic codes is a mystery that has long intrigued scientists \u2014 a tiny slice of Neanderthal DNA that persists tens of thousands of years after the species vanished.",
      "Most non-African people can attribute around 1% to 2% of their DNA to Neanderthal ancestors.",
      "But the details of that evolutionary history\u00a0have remained unclear. How often did ancient humans and Neanderthals interbreed? Exactly when did that happen? Why did Neanderthals go extinct, and why did modern humans survive? What does that Neanderthal DNA do for us now?",
      "Two research groups have separately analyzed collections of ancient genomes and come to the same conclusions about some of those core questions. Studies published in the journals Nature and Science on Thursday suggest that ancient humans and Neanderthals interbred during a limited period of time as the humans left Africa and migrated to new continents.",
      "The wave of interbreeding took place roughly 43,500 to 50,500 years ago, according to the findings. Then, over the next 100 generations, most Neanderthal DNA got weeded out \u2014\u00a0but not all. Today, the DNA that remains is linked to traits like skin pigmentation, immune response and metabolism.",
      "According to the new findings, the interbreeding event happened more recently than some previous estimates suggested, which in turn shifts and narrows the possible range of time when humans spread to places like present-day China and Australia.",
      "It also clarifies the significance of fossilized remains of humans discovered outside of Africa, like in Europe, that date back more than 50,000 years. The new studies say those populations died off and became evolutionary dead ends.",
      "\u201cHuman history is not just a story of success. We actually went extinct several times,\u201d said an author of the Nature paper, Johannes Krause, a professor at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple lineages that we have identified now that did not contribute to later people.\u201d",
      "The findings also demonstrate how skilled anthropologists have become at reconstructing ancient DNA and analyzing it to make inferences about the course of human history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very cool that we can look at these events from the past and really reconstruct what our paths look like,\u201d said an author of the Science paper, Priya Moorjani, an assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cFifty thousand years ago is a long time ago, but to be able to have genetic data from these samples really helps us paint a picture in more and more detail.\u201d",
      "The two research groups took different approaches to their work.",
      "Moorjani\u2019s group built a catalog of genomic information from 59 ancient individuals \u2014 who lived between 2,000 years ago and 45,000 years ago \u2014 and 275 present-day people. Then the researchers analyzed changes over time in the distribution and length of Neanderthal DNA in those genomes.",
      "They determined that the flow of Neanderthal genes into humans occurred roughly 47,000 years ago and lasted no more than 7,000 years. Those findings line up with archaeological evidence that suggests Neanderthals and humans overlapped in geography as humans traveled out of Africa. Many scientists suspect the two species crossed paths in the Middle East, but that\u2019s not confirmed.",
      "After the interbreeding, natural selection kept a few traits from Neanderthals while ditching many more.",
      "\u201cThe majority of selection, positive and negative, on Neanderthal ancestry happened very quickly after the gene flow, within roughly 100 generations,\u201d said a co-author of the Science paper, Leonardo Iasi, a postdoctoral researcher in the evolutionary genetics department at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.",
      "The other new study, in Nature, relied on an analysis of six genomes from remains discovered in Ranis, a cave site in present-day Germany that sits below a medieval castle. The remains date back about 45,000 years, and the DNA suggests two of the six individuals were a mother and daughter.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re now the oldest nuclear genomes that we have of modern humans,\u201d Krause said.",
      "The researchers also analyzed the DNA of an individual found in a cave site in present-day Czechia, about 140 miles from Ranis. The two sites date back to roughly the same period. The results indicated that two of the individuals found in Ranis were closely related to the one in the Czechia cave \u2014 within five or six degrees in family relation.",
      "They concluded that the individuals found at the two sites were most likely part of a small isolated population of perhaps just 200. From a genetic perspective, they didn\u2019t make it \u2014\u00a0the population died out.",
      "\u201cThey present a genetic lineage that has no descendants \u2014 that actually, later on, got extinct,\u201d Krause said.",
      "However, those individuals\u2019 DNA shares the same traces of Neanderthal influence as the remains that the other team of researchers analyzed. That strengthens the idea of a single event of \u201cadmixture\u201d \u2014 or interbreeding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have two independent studies that are working with independent data using independent methods that come up with basically the same answer. That engenders a lot of confidence,\u201d said Joshua Akey, a professor at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, who wasn\u2019t part of either research group.",
      "Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader on human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, said pinpointing the interbreeding event helps line up other key parts of the human evolution timeline. The findings constrain \u201cthe timing of the arrival of populations in regions like China and Australasia [Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea] that gave rise to present-day people in those areas to less than 50,000 years ago, because their genomes share the same interbreeding event,\u201d he said.",
      "The studies also clarify the time frame in which humans interbred with Denisovans, another extinct species, Stringer added \u2014\u00a0that took place after the introduction of Neanderthal DNA.",
      "Akey said questions remain, though. It\u2019s not clear how often humans and Neanderthals mated. And there\u2019s more to be learned about the traits humans got from Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA. Plus, there\u2019s the mysterious disappearance of Neanderthals 39,000 years ago.",

      "\u201cMy inclination is to think that mating was pretty frequent,\u201d Akey said. \u201cAnd that there was enough mating that it contributed to the disappearance of Neanderthals by incorporating them into human populations. But that\u2019s still speculative.\u201d"

      "Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the ambush killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO, was not insured by the company, the overarching business that owns it said.",
      "There is no record that Mangione, 26, was ever insured by the company, UnitedHealth Group said.",
      "Mangione is the suspect in the fatal shooting of CEO Brian Thompson on a New York City street on the morning of Dec. 4, as Thompson was walking to a hotel where an investor conference was being held.",
      "The killing remains under investigation.",
      "New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione\u2019s social media and writings indicate he suffered a painful back injury that was a \u201clife-altering injury.\u201d",
      "Kenny said Mangione may have targeted Thompson because of the size of UnitedHealthcare.",
      "\u201cWe have no indication that he was ever a client of United Healthcare, but he does make mention that it is the fifth-largest corporation in America, which would make it the largest health care organization in America,\u201d Kenny said in an interview that aired Thursday.",

      "The Franklin Fire, which has burned more than 4,000 acres and destroyed some homes, was 30% contained Thursday night, fire officials said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of success on the incident over the last couple of days,\u201d Dusty Martin, one of the fire incident commanders, said at a briefing Thursday.",
      "Martin said that around 3,700 residents have been allowed to return, which he called \"a big win.\"",
      "The fire broke out near a tunnel in Malibu Canyon Monday and it was exposed to high winds that fueled very aggressive growth and spread, Los Angeles County Fire Assistant Chief Drew Smith, operations section chief for Franklin Fire, said.",

      "At Pepperdine University, a shelter-in-place protocol for the Malibu campus was lifted Wednesday\u00a0and power was restored to the campus. It came after students had hunkered down on campus earlier this week as bright orange flames burned perilously close to the university.",
      "The Franklin Fire exploded as the region was under red flag warnings and under a rarely issued \"particularly dangerous situation\" red flag warning earlier this week. Red flag warnings are issued when there are strong wind gusts, extremely dry vegetation and low humidity, making conditions ripe for fire ignition and rapid spread.",

      "A UCLA student is suing multiple California health care providers and hospitals for medical negligence, alleging she was wrongly diagnosed with gender dysphoria and then \u201cfast-tracked onto the conveyor belt of irreversibly damaging\u201d puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery, according to her lawsuit.",
      "Kaya Clementine Breen, 20, said she experienced sexual abuse as a young child, and by the time she was 11, she \u201cbegan struggling with the thought of developing into a woman and began to believe that life would be easier if she were a boy,\u201d according to her suit filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. When she expressed this to her then-school counselor, the counselor told her \u201cthat she was transgender and called her parents to tell them the same.\u201d",
      "Breen, who was also suffering from anxiety, depression and undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the lawsuit, was then taken by her parents to the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, where she said she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria \u2014\u00a0the distress one can experience when their gender identity and birth sex are in conflict \u2014 and began to receive transition-related care at 12 years old.",
      "\u201cThis case is about a team of purported health care providers who collectively decided that a vulnerable girl struggling with complex mental health struggles and suffering from multiple instances of sexual abuse should be prescribed a series of life-altering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, ultimately, receive a double mastectomy at the age of 14,\u201d Breen\u2019s lawsuit states.",
      "Breen began receiving puberty-suppressing medication at 12, was prescribed cross-sex hormones from 13 to 19 and underwent a double mastectomy at 14, according to court documents, which stated that her \u201cher mental health progressively declined\u201d following these treatments.",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Breen said, \u201cIn retrospect, I wish that somebody had suggested real, genuine therapy first, instead of gender-specific therapy, because really the only therapy that I received until much later was specifically focused on gender dysphoria, and didn\u2019t connect my gender dysphoria to anything else.\u201d",
      "Breen said she began to question her decision to transition after she started dialectical behavior therapy, a type of talk therapy that seeks to help those struggling with intense emotions, earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI sort of started questioning my own gender identity and if I was doing this for the right reasons,\u201d she said.",
      "The defendants in Breen\u2019s lawsuit include Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, an adolescent medicine physician specializing in gender-affirming care; Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles; Dr. Scott Mosser, a plastic surgeon specializing in gender-affirming surgery; the Gender Confirmation Center of San Francisco; UCSF Health Community Hospitals; and psychotherapist Susan P. Landon.",
      "When asked to comment on the lawsuit, a spokesperson said the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, where Olson-Kennedy works, has\u202f\u201cprovided high quality, age-appropriate, medically necessary care for more than 30 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cTreatment is patient- and family-centered, following guidelines from professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and Endocrine Society. We do not comment on pending litigation; and out of respect for patient privacy and in compliance with state and federal laws, we do not comment on specific patients and/or their treatment,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email, adding that \u201cDr. Olson-Kennedy is unavailable for comment.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the Gender Confirmation Center in San Francisco, where Mosser works, said there\u2019s \u201cno such thing as a rubber stamp patient interaction\u201d at their health facility.",
      "\u201cAs healthcare providers, and in compliance with HIPAA considerations, we are unable to comment on specific protected health information or pending litigation,\u201d the spokesperson added in their email, which also included a link to a statement from Mosser.",
      "Mosser\u2019s statement, which appears to have been posted to the Gender Confirmation Center\u2019s website last week, applauded the center as being \u201cat the forefront of gender-affirming surgery, with the wellbeing of our patients as our highest priority.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur robust processes and protocols are designed to ensure that patients navigating our services fully understand the implications of the gender-affirming procedures they may choose to undergo as part of their transition,\u201d Mosser stated. \u201cWe regularly hear from former patients sharing updates about the overwhelmingly positive impact these surgeries have had on their lives \u2014 messages that continue to arrive many years after their procedures.\u201d",
      "UCSF Health Community Hospitals, which is named in the lawsuit, told NBC News that Saint Francis Memorial Hospital, where Breen was a patient in 2019, was not acquired by UCSF until August of this year. It had no further comment.",
      "Landon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Breen said she doesn\u2019t believe the individual health providers named in her lawsuit \u201cintentionally acted in poor faith,\u201d but she alleged they were dismissive of her pre-existing mental health issues.",
      "When asked what she hopes to get from this lawsuit, Breen said she wants \u201csome semblance of justice or change.\u201d While she is seeking \u201cfinancial reimbursement for the amount that this has cost me and my family,\u201d she said, she most of all wants to \u201chelp dismantle the rumor that no one is ever fast-tracked into gender treatments.\u201d",
      "A long list of major U.S. medical associations \u2014\u00a0including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association \u2014 support transgender minors having access to transition-related care, like puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and have denounced state laws restricting such care.",
      "\u201cThere is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving,\u201d Dr. Moira Szilagyi wrote on the American Academy of Pediatrics website in August 2022, when she was the organization\u2019s president. \u201cThe decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.\u201d",
      "Gender-affirming care for minors can look different depending on the child\u2019s age and circumstances. For young children, care may involve a new name or pronoun as opposed to physical changes. At the onset of puberty, children may begin puberty blockers to inhibit them from developing secondary sex characteristics like breasts or facial hair. Hormone therapy may come next, which would allow the teenager to physically develop into the gender matching their identity. Surgical gender-affirming care is rarely performed on minors, and these procedures are illegal in dozens of states, though California is not among them.",
      "Over the past few years, there have been several lawsuits filed in the U.S. and the U.K. by \u201cdetransitioners,\u201d or those who transitioned genders and then transitioned back to their birth sex. A 21-year-old New York woman who had detransitioned sued Planned Parenthood and several individual health care providers in April claiming medical malpractice and a lack of informed consent, alleging the defendants rushed her into undergoing gender-affirming care as a minor.",
      "Research suggests that regretting treatment for gender dysphoria is \u201cextremely rare,\u201d according to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, or WPATH. A survey conducted in 2015 by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 8% of respondents detransitioned at some point in their life, with 62% of that group only detransitioning temporarily.",
      "Transition-related care for minors has been a divisive political issue, with Republicans in 26 states passing measures to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors in recent years, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a case challenging Tennessee\u2019s ban on such care.",
      "The politics surrounding gender-affirming care for minors were also reportedly behind a decision by Olson-Kennedy, one of the defendants in Breen\u2019s lawsuit, to delay publication of a study she conducted on the effects of puberty blockers. Olson-Kennedy told The New York Times in an article published in October that she didn\u2019t publish the results, which found the medication did not improve the mental health of minors with gender dysphoria, because she feared the findings might fuel the types of political attacks that led to state bans on gender-affirming care."

      "An 80-year-old woman died one month after her Sleep Number bed suddenly moved without warning and trapped her against a wall for two days last year, a new lawsuit alleges.",
      "Rosalind Walker was trapped on March 1, 2023, when her Sleep Number bed, which had its adjustable foundation in a raised position,\u00a0\u201clowered without warning\u201d and trapped her between the bed and the wall of her bedroom in Godfrey, Illinois, her daughter, Angela Moan, says in a complaint filed Tuesday.",
      "The complaint says the bed suddenly \u201clowered with such force\u201d that Walker was stuck and unable to free herself.",
      "She remained stuck in that position in the bedroom until March 3, when first responders finally released her.",
      "She was taken to a hospital, then transferred to a rehabilitation center and taken home on hospice care, the filing says.",
      "\u201cShe suffered the entire time until she died on April 3, 2023,\u201d the petition says.",
      "Moan filed the wrongful death complaint in St. Louis County, Missouri, court against Sleep Number Corp. and Leggett & Platt Inc., both of which designed, manufactured, marketed, sold and warrantied the bed.",
      "Walker bought the bed, which had a 25-year warranty, in Brentwood, Missouri, on Oct. 19, 2014. It was later delivered to Walker\u2019s home in Godfrey.",
      "The complaint claims the defendants breached their duty by selling the bed without adequate instructions or cautionary language warning that a person could get stuck between the bed and a wall, failed to have an audible warning system to alert that the bed was declining, and lacked \"an appropriate release mechanism that would have allowed Walker to free herself.\"",
      "\u201cSleep Number Corporation is strictly liable for Mrs. Walker\u2019s injuries, her suffering, and her death,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cThe Sleep Number Bed was defective and unreasonably dangerous in its design and lack of warning.\u201d",
      "Moan alleges negligence, wrongful death, strict liability and breach of warranty. The suit seeks compensation for Walker's death, suffering and injuries, related medical bills and \"the loss of her mother\u2019s society.\"",
      "It seeks compensation more than the jurisdictional amount of $25,000.",
      "Leggett & Platt, the manufacturer of the adjustable base, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon.",
      "Sleep Number said Thursday it is aware of the lawsuit.",
      "\"We understand that this incident is alleged to have occurred in March 2023; we were notified of the alleged incident after the lawsuit was filed this week, December 10. We extend our sincere condolences to the family of Ms. Walker for their tragic loss,\" the statement said. \"Currently, our legal team is reviewing the lawsuit. Sleep Number stands by the design and safety of its products and is complying with any necessary inquiries or actions.\"",
      "Ted Gianaris, an attorney for Moan, told NBC News on Thursday that the bed's manufacturers should have better systems to avoid entrapment, just as elevators have sensors to keep closing force low to prevent injuries.",
      "\u201cBy design, this bed has a timer that lets it lower on its own, but it has no alert, no sensor, and no release,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis is a tragic loss of a vibrant woman who was completely independent.\u00a0Mrs. Walker was trapped for two days and then she later died. Something as common as an adjustable bed should not be a trap,\" Gianaris said. \"We look forward to hearing from the corporations about why they did not sell a safer bed.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 23:28:16 GMT",
    "summary": "A federal program that helped nourish hundreds of thousands of Tennessee children over the summer will expire unless the governor renews it by Jan. 1.",
    "story": [
      "A federal program that helped nourish hundreds of thousands of Tennessee children over the summer is at risk of expiring in the state unless the governor renews it by Jan. 1 \u2014 which he has indicated he does not plan to do.",
      "The Summer EBT program provides $120 per child on electronic benefits transfer, or EBT, cards that low-income families can use to buy groceries when the school year ends. Initially a temporary relief measure during the pandemic, the program is now a permanent summer option, and it has helped many households afford nutritious food: The U.S. Agriculture Department, which oversees Summer EBT, estimates that nearly 21 million children across the country benefited from it this summer.",
      "States must opt into the federally funded program for children to receive the summer grocery credits, and some states have declined to participate, citing administrative costs that partially come from state budgets, plus existing food programs that leaders say supply adequate nutrition when school is out.",
      "This summer, 37 states, including Tennessee, participated in the Summer EBT program, also known as SUN Bucks, according to the Agriculture Department.",
      "For next summer, Tennessee is one of about a dozen states set to potentially turn down a combined $1.14 billion in federal funding to feed 9.5 million children, according to the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy organization, which is urging Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others to reconsider.",
      "\u201cWe know that summer can be the hungriest time for children, and when the school year ends, millions of children lose access to school meals nationwide,\u201d said Kelsey Boone, a senior child nutrition policy analyst at the Food Research & Action Center.",
      "She said other options aimed at reducing children\u2019s food insecurity are helpful, like the Summer Food Service Program, which distributes free kids\u2019 meals and snacks at locations such as parks and schools. But work schedules, lack of transportation and other factors often prevent families from being able to get to summer meal sites.",
      "\u201cThose summer meals only reach a fraction of the children who need them, and that\u2019s why Summer EBT is so important,\u201d Boone said.",
      "While advocates want all states to enroll in Summer EBT, they say Tennessee presents a particularly compelling need. With Tennessee\u2019s numerous rural, mountainous regions, families are often far from food banks or other meal distribution sites. Making matters worse: Some communities in the eastern part of the state that already faced high rates of hunger and poverty were devastated when Hurricane Helene hit in late September, compounding residents\u2019 struggles (neighboring North Carolina, which was also ravaged by Helene, has expressed its commitment to Summer EBT for 2025).",
      "Those in favor of Summer EBT say it has a proven record in Tennessee: State data shows that more than 656,000 children participated in it this year, enabling their households to buy fresh fruit, vegetables and other groceries.",
      "Bobbi Jo Miller\u2019s three school-age children were among those who received the summer benefits. Miller, who lives in Unicoi County, is a single mom who cannot work because she is disabled. She does not drive, making it challenging for her to travel to summer meal sites with her kids. With the Summer EBT funds, she said, she was able to join neighbors and friends on their trips to supermarkets to buy staples such as eggs, milk, bread and cereal.",
      "She cried when she heard Lee does not plan to renew the program in 2025.",
      "\u201cI have a very fixed income,\u201d she said. \u201cTo know that the governor doesn\u2019t want to help in the one little way he could is heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "Miller has not yet mentioned to her children, the youngest of whom is 9, that they might not have funds on their EBT cards next summer because she does not want to cause them stress. But she is already wondering how she will make ends meet once the school year ends.",
      "\u201cI have no clue how I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d",
      "Her concerns are echoed by anti-hunger advocates such as Rhonda Chafin, executive director of Second Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Tennessee, which serves about 43,000 people every month.",
      "\u201cHow can we say no to families that need additional resources?\u201d she said. \u201cHow can we say no to any program that\u2019s going to bring federal dollars to help families in need with children?\u201d",
      "The Tennessee Justice Center, a public policy advocacy organization, is not giving up hope. It has encouraged hundreds of people to send letters asking the governor to renew Summer EBT for 2025, said Signe Anderson, the center\u2019s senior director of nutrition advocacy.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe are doing everything that we can to urge the governor to change his mind.\u201d",
      "But in an email this week, Lee\u2019s office said he does not plan to extend the program.",
      "\u201cThe Summer EBT program was established in the pandemic-era to supplement existing food assistance programs in an extraordinary circumstance. The federal government has increasingly shifted the administrative cost burden to the states, prompting Tennessee not to renew our participation, as the program is mostly duplicative,\u201d press secretary Elizabeth Lane Johnson wrote, adding that the Summer Food Service Program served about 3.4 million free meals to children in Tennessee this year.",
      "Advocates say cost is not a valid reason to deny grocery funds to children in need. For this summer, Tennessee paid more than $5.7 million in administrative costs from its budget for Summer EBT, according to the state Department of Human Services. The program brought about $78 million in federal Summer EBT funds to struggling families in Tennessee, which the Food Research & Action Center estimated had up to a $139.1 million total economic impact on the state.",
      "Those fighting childhood hunger feel that aid \u2014 and money \u2014 should be flowing into Tennessee.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a missed opportunity for our families and our state as a whole,\u201d said Marissa Spady, senior manager of No Kid Hungry Tennessee, a campaign working to end childhood hunger. \u201cIt would be a disappointment.\u201d",

      "Three men accused Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of rape and sexual assault in separate lawsuits filed Thursday that allege the rap impresario plied them with doctored drinks and then attacked them while they were unconscious.",
      "The lawsuits, filed anonymously in New York state Supreme Court by lawyer Thomas Giuffra, involve incidents alleged to have happened from 2019 to 2022. All allege that Combs raped and sexually assaulted them.",
      "One of the men, a longtime employee of Combs, told NBC News that he was raped in a New York hotel where he met Combs to discuss a \u201csubstantial amount of money\u201d he was owed from his off-the-books job.",
      "The man said that he worked for Combs from 2006 to 2018 running errands and that while they weren\u2019t \u201cbuddy, buddy,\u201d he also didn\u2019t expect to be victimized when he met with him in early 2020. But inside the room, the man said, Combs served him a drink, and in \u201ctwo minutes, I start to feel, like, just very tired, very sleepy.\u201d",
      "When he came to, he said, Combs was raping him, and when he tried to stop him, he said, Combs told him: \u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe phrase that just rattles in my brain all the time is \u2018I\u2019m almost done,'\u201d he said. \u201cJust stop, just stop moving. I\u2019m almost finished. Like, I\u2019m almost done.\u201d",
      "Giuffra told NBC News that the way the men allege Combs went after them was \u201cvery consistent, frighteningly consistent, exactly consistent. He would hit them with the drinks, knock them out.\u201d",
      "And when they woke up, \u201che\u2019d be raping them,\u201d Giuffra said.",
      "The new complaints are the latest in a wave of lawsuits filed against Combs in recent months \u2014 all with the complainants withholding their names \u2014 accusing him of assault and rape under similar circumstances going back to the 1990s. Combs has been behind bars since September, when he was arrested by federal agents and accused of engaging in a yearslong scheme to sexually abuse and exploit women.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs, among other things, used his business empire to coerce victims into elaborate, drug-fueled \u201cfreak offs\u201d with male sex workers that he arranged, directed and recorded.",
      "Combs, 55, who is being detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, has pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "His lawyers have said he is innocent of all charges. He has been denied bail three times ahead of his criminal trial, which is scheduled to start in May.",
      "The three men Giuffra represents all seek unspecified damages from Combs and his companies, along with a jury trial. They\u2019re also not divulging their real names.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re afraid that one night, somebody affiliated with him, hired by him, could end their life,\u201d Giuffra said.",
      "In addition to Combs, the three lawsuits list as defendants Bad Boy Entertainment Holdings Inc., Bad Boy Entertainment LLC., Bad Boy Productions Holdings Inc., Daddy\u2019s House Recordings Inc. and Sony Music Holdings Inc.",
      "\u201cThese complaints are full of lies. We will prove them false and seek sanctions against every unethical lawyer who filed fictional claims against him,\u201d Combs\u2019 legal team said in a statement Thursday.",
      "All complainants are identified in the new lawsuits as John Doe, and they all allege that the abuse happened under similar circumstances with Combs preying on the men by luring them, with the help of his associates, to hotel rooms or his private home, plying them with drugged drinks and then sexually assaulting and raping them.",
      "Another complainant said he met Combs at a Manhattan nightclub in 2019 and was \u201crecruited\u201d by Combs\u2019 security guards to join him \u201cand the rest of his entourage at the Park Hyatt hotel for an exclusive afterparty.\u201d",
      "There, he said in the lawsuit, Combs offered him a \u201ccocktail\u201d that he had personally made and then invited him and the other guests into a bedroom.",
      "\u201cOnce Plaintiff entered the bedroom, the room \u2018started spinning\u2019 and his mouth became very dry,\u201d the man said, according to the court papers.",
      "Combs eventually led him to a sofa, where he lost consciousness and later awoke to Combs raping him, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The man said in the lawsuit that he tried to resist and that, before he blacked out again, he remembered seeing\u00a0\u201ca man and a woman sitting on the bed recording the rape on a camera.\u201d",
      "The next morning, he was given $2,500 by the man who recorded the alleged rape and said it was from Combs, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In the third lawsuit, a man alleged that he \u201cfell victim to one or more criminal sex acts\u201d at the hands of Combs \u201cand his associates\u201d from 2020 to 2022.",
      "He said that in the summer of 2020, one of Combs' \u201cassociates\u201d at Bad Boy Records invited him to a party at Combs' mansion in East Hampton, New York.",
      "At the party, he \u201cbegan feeling ill and subsequently lost consciousness\u201d after he had a drink, according to the lawsuit. \u201cThroughout the rest of the night, Plaintiff faded in-and-out of consciousness,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The man said in the lawsuit that Combs and \u201chis associates from Bad Boy Records\u201d took turns sexually assaulting and raping him.",
      "Combs\u2019 legal issues have been mounting since last year, when an ex-girlfriend, Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura, filed an explosive lawsuit accusing him of assault and sex trafficking over the course of their relationship.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but settled with Ventura for an undisclosed amount. Then, several months later, CNN obtained security video from a hotel that showed Combs brutally beating Ventura in 2016. Combs later apologized for his actions.",
      "Multiple other lawsuits have been filed against Combs since then, including one from Dawn Richard, a former member of the girl group Danity Kane. She alleged that Combs groped, assaulted and imprisoned her and threatened her life.",
      "Combs has denied all the claims against him, calling them \u201csickening allegations\u201d from people looking for \u201ca quick payday.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, met with incoming border czar Tom Homan on Thursday, a meeting that both men described in positive terms.",
      "\"His goal is the same goal I have,\" Adams said at a press conference following the meeting. \"We cannot allow dangerous individuals to commit repeated violent acts of violence in our cities across America.\"",
      "Homan said in an interview with Dr. Phil McGraw after the meeting that he believes what he and Adams discussed Thursday \"may save lives,\" expressing gratitude toward Adams for meeting with him.",
      "\"I'm grateful that biggest city in this country, the biggest sanctuary city in this country, is willing to come to the table and help me with my two biggest priorities: criminals and children,\" Homan said in the interview with McGraw, which aired on his platform Merit TV.",
      "Homan also laid out during the interview what he sees as misconceptions about President-elect Donald Trump's deportation plans.",
      "\"This isn't a racial sweep. This isn't military personnel driving through your neighborhood. This is a targeted, well-planned operation,\" Homan said.",
      "Just days after he won last month's presidential election, Trump tapped Homan to serve as border czar, one of the earliest key hires for his second administration. Homan is a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A proponent of hard-line border policies, Homan supported the first Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which resulted in family separations at the southern border.",
      "Trump made immigration and the border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, vowing mass deportations and frequently using degrading language toward migrants.",
      "New York City has laws in place limiting how local agencies cooperate with federal deportation efforts. Adams cannot unilaterally rescind the city's sanctuary status; rather, the status is determined by the city council.",
      "But the mayor said earlier this year that he supported a bill that would roll back parts of the city's sanctuary policies.",
      "\"I've stated this over and over again, long before this election, that this can't be a safe haven of violent individuals,\" Adams said during Thursday's press conference. \"You have a right, a privilege, to live in this country, and those who want to commit acts of violence, they are violating that privilege.\"",
      "The city saw an influx of migrants in 2022 and 2023, prompting Adams to urge the federal government to provide additional assistance and funds. Other Democratic mayors also asked for additional federal assistance in response to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott transporting migrants who arrived in Texas to blue states.",
      "Adams' political future has been uncertain since he was charged in September with wire fraud and bribery. He has denied any wrongdoing."

      "All had their federal sentences commuted by President Joe Biden on Thursday in the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "Biden commuted close to 1,500 sentences and pardoned 39 people in a sweeping and historic act for people who had been convicted of nonviolent crimes \u2014 many related to illegal drugs \u2014 and released from prison more than a year ago under a pandemic-era law, the CARES Act, to limit crowding in federal prisons.",

      "At the time, it was described as one of the most sweeping corruption cases in Ohio\u2019s history. Dimora was released to home confinement in June 2023 after having served nearly 12 years. His sentence was reduced after a partial appellate court win in 2022.",

      "Malcolm Hartzog\u2019s life sentence had already been commuted to 30 years in prison by President Barack Obama in 2016, in what at the time was a record-setting use of clemency power.

The $26 million scheme involved billing Medicare for services that were never provided and efforts to bypass the government\u2019s probe. Lovett was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered by the federal District judge in the case to pay more than $9 million in restitution.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI failed to take the \"basic step\" of canvassing its field offices for intelligence ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to a long-awaited Justice Department's inspector general report released Thursday.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told investigators that the lack of a canvass was a \"basic step that was missed\" and that he would have expected it to have occurred, the inspector general's office said.",
      "The inspector general did find that the FBI \"recognized the potential for violence\" and took \"significant and appropriate steps\" even though it played \"only a supporting role in preparing for and responding to\" the events of Jan. 6.",
      "The report also includes details that will almost certainly fuel the \"fedsurrection\" narrative that has been growing on the right and among Donald Trump supporters: the false notion that the federal government was responsible for instigating the attack.",
      "While the review found \"no evidence in the materials we reviewed or the testimony we received showing or suggesting that the FBI had undercover employees in the various protest crowds, or at the Capitol, on January 6,\" the inspector general's office said 26 confidential human sources, or CHSes, were in Washington that day. None of them were \"authorized by the FBI to enter the Capitol or a restricted area or to otherwise break the law on January 6, nor was any CHS directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6,\" the inspector general said.",
      "Four FBI confidential human sources entered the Capitol, according to the inspector general, one of whom testified at the Proud Boys trial in which several members of the far-right group were found guilty of seditious conspiracy. A total of 13 confidential human sources entered the restricted area around the Capitol, the inspector general\u2019s report said, while the remaining nine never entered the Capitol or restricted areas. Only three of the 26 FBI confidential human sources had specifically \"been tasked by FBI field offices to report on specific domestic terrorism case subjects who were possibly attending the events of January 6,\" while the 23 others attended\u00a0\"on their own initiative and were not tasked by FBI field offices to attend the events,\" the report said.",
      "None of the FBI informants have been prosecuted in relation to the Jan. 6 attack. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said it had generally not charged \"individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals; and we have treated the CHSs consistent with this approach.\u201d",
      "While more than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the attack, thousands of others who were either inside the building or on the restricted grounds of the Capitol will most likely never face charges with just over a month remaining before Trump takes office. Online sleuths have identified hundreds of participants to the FBI, including 93 whose photos are on its Capitol Violence website, most of whom are wanted for assaulting officers that day.",
      "The inspector general's report focuses on events that happened four years ago, in late 2020 and early 2021, when Trump was working to overturn his election loss. The inspector general's Jan. 6-related oversight has been delayed by both the prosecutions of hundreds of Jan. 6 cases and special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s separate, wide-spanning criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A federal grand jury ultimately indicted Trump on four felony charges in connection with that effort, but Trump was able to delay the trial, and Smith moved to drop the charges after Trump's win in November. Smith is still expected to issue a written report on his investigation.",
      "An NBC News review of thousands of pages of FBI documents connected to Jan. 6 revealed a bureau struggling with technology and communications, as well as being impeded from having honest conversations about the threat environment caused in large part by the man occupying the White House."

      "The three-hour drive Kwame Alexander had taken countless times from Nikki Giovanni\u2019s home in Christiansburg, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., felt different on Thursday morning. Three days prior, he had stood by Giovanni\u2019s bedside with her family and a handful of close friends as the legendary poet and activist took her last breath.",
      "Giovanni died Monday at age 81 of complications from lung cancer. Alexander spent the week with her wife, Virginia C. Fowler, and others helping with funeral arrangements.",
      "But in the solitude of his car as he returned home, Alexander revisited the unique bond he and Giovanni developed over decades, and how it crystallized the impact she had on the lives of countless Black writers.",
      "\u201cThis drive is tough but necessary for me to be alone with my thoughts,\u201d said Alexander, 56, a New York Times bestselling author of young adult fiction. He and Giovanni had a tumultuous start to their friendship. Alexander took three classes under Giovanni while at Virginia Tech and received C\u2019s in each.",
      "He was not happy. \u201cWhen I left college, I was done with her,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "Over the years, they became cordial. Giovanni even asked Alexander to contribute to an anthology about grandfathers after he had lost his.",
      "Then, seven years after he graduated, Giovanni was quoted in an article about Alexander, saying, \u201cIf I can have a literary son, I\u2019d like to think it would be Kwame Alexander.\u201d He was floored.",
      "In 2007, she invited him over for dinner, exposing him for the first time to lamb chops and Brussels sprouts. Fowler made scalloped potatoes. Late in the evening, Alexander cried. Giovanni did, too, although she did not know what brought on his tears.",
      "\u201cIt was guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been angry for so long and had said things about her. She said, \u2018If I gave you a C, you deserved it. My goal was to help you become who you needed to be. And I think I did that.\u2019 That\u2019s who she was. My mother taught me how to love books. My father introduced me to all facets of literature. Nikki Giovanni taught me how to make words paint on a page and how to be a better man.\u201d",
      "Born Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr., she became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, penning powerful, self-affirming poems.

      "\u201cHer death struck me in a way I can\u2019t describe,\u201d said author Suzetta Perkins, who first saw Giovanni as a student at Fayetteville State University. \u201cI was saddened, hurt to hear of her passing.\u201d",
      "She met Giovanni in 1999 as an aspiring author. \u201cWhile Ms. Giovanni didn\u2019t know it, maybe she sensed it, her sweet spirit took a second to tell me to be my authentic self,\u201d Perkins said. She was inspired. The next year, she wrote her first novel, \u201cBehind the Veil.\u201d Perkins has gone on to write 14 novels and was recently acknowledged by Chosen Pen Publishing with its Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award for service.",
      "Marita Golden was a sophomore at American University in 1969 when Giovanni selected one of her poems for an anthology. It was \u201cmajor,\u201d said Golden, who went on to become a prolific author of more than 20 books, a creative writing professor and a co-founder of the Hurston/Wright Foundation, an organization that honors Black writers.",
      "Golden and Giovanni worked together on various events and projects. Her death left Golden melancholy.",
      "\u201cShe did something very special for poetry. She made poetry this home, this place for people to live in,\u201d Golden said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of college students or high school students who, when I\u2019ve assigned one of her poems or a book, already knew her. They already loved her. She\u2019d already changed their lives.\u201d",
      "Giovanni\u2019s power was multidimensional. She wrote romantically about love and spoke intensely about race. Her commitment to gender equality was unwavering. Her passion for Black people was ironclad. And through the years, she made herself an accessible icon.",

She wanted to be called \u2018Nikki.\u2019 Her poetry had this pulse, this life. She was very authentic. She spoke her mind and took a lot of risks in what she said, risks in what she did. Her poems were like living things. And I think that\u2019s why people were drawn to it, drawn to her.\u201d",
      "Sharon Foster can attest to that. A poet who works as a communications specialist in the Washington, D.C., area, Foster encountered Giovanni at events at Busboys and Poets, a local lounge that features author readings, poetry and spoken-word performances.",
      "Giovanni was in the audience as Foster read from her first book, \u201cLive Lightly: A Summer of Poetry.\u201d As she left the stage, Giovanni \u201creached out to me and said, \u2018All right, now. I hear you, Sista.\u2019 To have someone so esteemed give that sort of affirmation about my work really just blew me away. We have really lost a treasure.\u201d",
      "Especially Alexander. He and Giovanni built a bond through conversations about Black people and literature while enjoying libations and savory food, often prepared by Giovanni.",
      "He recalled a literary event in Harlem where he interviewed his friend. \u201cI prepared 10 questions I knew I would ask her,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked her the first question. Her answer lasted an hour. It was over. That was it. She got a standing ovation. She fed you with a lot of hope, a lot of love, a lot of family.\u201d",
      "They traveled to West Africa together twice. When his mother died in 2017, Giovanni attended the funeral. Alexander told her, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to be here.\u201d She gave him some choice words and said, \u201cYou need to know you still have a mother.\u201d",
      "It was that kind of passion and commitment that resonated with countless readers and authors, Golden said.",
      "\u201cNikki\u2019s cannon is universal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s irreplaceable, and it has as much energy and relevance today as when she first wrote the poems. And because they\u2019re reflective, they\u2019re her autobiography. And her autobiography was about generosity, about being Black and proud of that, and honoring family and honoring your roots \u2014 but also being human. And so that never goes away. That\u2019s always in style.\u201d",
      "Alexander agreed that Giovanni\u2019s reach has been \u201cexpansive, and it\u2019s majestic, and it\u2019s magnificent. She taught us through her writing, through her living. \u2026 She taught us how to speak our voice. Nikki was unfiltered. She said what was on her mind, what she believed. If we really learned anything from her, it is to be bold, to lift our voices, to write what we want to write, to speak up about the things that matter, and to give a voice to the voices of those like her who came before us. She was unapologetically a matter-of-fact Black. As writers, she taught us that through her life.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:20:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The lien on Donna and Gary Lindabury's home for a 15-year-old medical debt was one of 11,500 released by Atrium Health after an NBC News report.",
    "story": [
      "For 15 years, Donna and Gary Lindabury, of Vylas, North Carolina, lived with the financial equivalent of an anvil over their heads: a medical debt owed to a nonprofit hospital that at one point reached $200,000.",
      "The debt, owed to Atrium Health for emergency heart surgery Gary underwent in 2009, grew over the years to include almost $100,000 in interest charges, Donna, 72, told NBC News. \u201cWe were striving, we were trying, we paid our bills,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just couldn\u2019t afford to pay that hospital.\u201d",
      "As the years went by and the debt remained, the hospital system placed a lien on the Lindaburys\u2019 home, allowing it to recover what was owed if the couple sold the property.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been just so consumed with just trying to get by with this problem,\u201d Gary, 80, said.",
      "Then, in early November, the Lindaburys received a letter from Atrium Health telling them it was removing what was left on the lien \u2014 $92,262 \u2014 and leaving them free and clear of any obligation to the hospital.",
      "They were among the beneficiaries of a decision the hospital system announced in September to release 11,500 liens on people\u2019s homes in North Carolina and five other states, some of which dated back 20 years or more.",
      "\u201cIt is like a miracle,\u201d Donna said. \u201cWe just thought we\u2019re never going to own our house and be able to pass it down to our kids.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Atrium Health provided a statement saying the mission of its parent company, Advocate Health, \u201cis to provide access to high-quality care for everyone in the communities we serve, no matter their financial circumstances.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a leader in health care, we have long been committed to programs that help people struggling with medical debt,\u201d the statement added.\u202f\u201cRemoving judgment liens on homes to recover unpaid medical bills was a natural next step in our continuing efforts to make sure patients aren\u2019t burdened by medical costs.\u201d",
      "Almost 18% of the U.S.\u2019 gross domestic product goes to health care \u2014 far more than other developed countries \u2014 with roughly\u202fone-third of those dollars spent on hospital care, according to National Health Expenditures data. And as health care costs rise, more and more patients struggle to pay for their care, even those with insurance.",
      "Americans owe $220 billion in medical debt, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization. Health care expenses are a top cause of bankruptcy in the U.S., a 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found. Research\u202fconducted by the Urban Institute found that medical debt is more common in the South and among people in low-income ZIP codes. In 2021, the institute found that three North Carolina counties were among the 10 U.S. counties whose residents held the most medical debt.",
      "Advocate Health\u2019s decision to release thousands of liens on former patients\u2019 homes came after NBC News detailed how its Atrium Health unit aggressively pursued patients\u2019 medical debts.",
      "Medical debt judgments can last up to 20 years in North Carolina, and according to a study by Duke University School of Law faculty and the Office of State Treasurer, hospitals in the state sued 7,517 patients and their family members to collect medical debt from January 2017 through June 2022.",
      "Many of these suits resulted in default judgments and allowed for 8% interest charges, inflating the amounts owed as occurred in the Lindaburys\u2019 case. In total, the report said, interest charges and other added fees accounted for 35% of the $57.3 million in total judgments owed by patients.",
      "Under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals are supposed to offer financial assistance programs to patients who can\u2019t afford care, but patients don\u2019t always receive information about these programs, health care experts say.",
      "Recognizing the burden that medical debt places on consumers, some states have moved in recent years to remedy the problem. Arizona and Colorado now cap the interest rates levied on medical debt, while Delaware recently passed a law prohibiting interest and late fees on these bills. Maryland requires hospitals to reimburse patients who paid their bills but should have been eligible for financial assistance.",
      "Back in North Carolina, the Lindaburys are still processing the release of their debt burden. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in prison,\u201d Donna said, \u201cand now you\u2019re out.\u201d"

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, met with incoming border czar Tom Homan on Thursday, a meeting that both men described in positive terms.",
      "\"His goal is the same goal I have,\" Adams said at a press conference following the meeting. \"We cannot allow dangerous individuals to commit repeated violent acts of violence in our cities across America.\"",
      "Homan said in an interview with Dr. Phil McGraw after the meeting that he believes what he and Adams discussed Thursday \"may save lives,\" expressing gratitude toward Adams for meeting with him.",
      "\"I'm grateful that biggest city in this country, the biggest sanctuary city in this country, is willing to come to the table and help me with my two biggest priorities: criminals and children,\" Homan said in the interview with McGraw, which aired on his platform Merit TV.",
      "Homan also laid out during the interview what he sees as misconceptions about President-elect Donald Trump's deportation plans.",
      "\"This isn't a racial sweep. This isn't military personnel driving through your neighborhood. This is a targeted, well-planned operation,\" Homan said.",
      "Just days after he won last month's presidential election, Trump tapped Homan to serve as border czar, one of the earliest key hires for his second administration. Homan is a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A proponent of hard-line border policies, Homan supported the first Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which resulted in family separations at the southern border.",
      "Trump made immigration and the border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, vowing mass deportations and frequently using degrading language toward migrants.",
      "New York City has laws in place limiting how local agencies cooperate with federal deportation efforts. Adams cannot unilaterally rescind the city's sanctuary status; rather, the status is determined by the city council.",
      "But the mayor said earlier this year that he supported a bill that would roll back parts of the city's sanctuary policies.",
      "\"I've stated this over and over again, long before this election, that this can't be a safe haven of violent individuals,\" Adams said during Thursday's press conference. \"You have a right, a privilege, to live in this country, and those who want to commit acts of violence, they are violating that privilege.\"",
      "The city saw an influx of migrants in 2022 and 2023, prompting Adams to urge the federal government to provide additional assistance and funds. Other Democratic mayors also asked for additional federal assistance in response to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott transporting migrants who arrived in Texas to blue states.",
      "Adams' political future has been uncertain since he was charged in September with wire fraud and bribery. He has denied any wrongdoing."

    "story": [
      "Jonathan Bailey is reflecting on his sexuality and how its evolved over time.",
      "In an interview with British Vogue published on Dec. 12, Bailey talked about exploring his sexuality in his early 20s. The \"Wicked\" actor recalled dating a girl for a couple of years, but during that same era, he also came out as gay to his family and some close friends, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting with the binary, where you\u2019re perceived to be either this or that,\" Bailey said in the interview. \"That\u2019s how I saw it at the time, but there are so many nuances to it. My experience of that relationship was not that I was in the shadows. She remains one of my best friends.\u201d",
      "The \"Bridgerton\" star believes that even before he was \"aware\" of his own sexuality, others picked up on it. He recalled his parents support when he wanted to pursue ballet at a young age.",
      "\u201cI remember looking through the window at these girls at school in their tutus,\" he said. They were doing, like, first position, second position, and I knew I just wanted to be in there.\u201d",
      "But not all of Bailey's childhood memories are positive. He remembered a time when he was struggling with schoolwork, and his teacher called him out in front of the entire class, saying, \u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t so busy being a fairy you\u2019d understand.\u201d",
      "During an interview with GQ in March 2022, Bailey recalled getting to the point later in life when he was done hiding his sexuality from the public.",
      "\"I reached a point where I thought, f--- this, I\u2019d much prefer to hold my boyfriend\u2019s hand in public or be able to put my own face picture on Tinder and not be so concerned about that than getting a part.\"",
      "Bailey is aware that there is much more work to be done when it comes to protecting LGBTQ+ rights and the community's youth, as seen through his own experience.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been a confident hand-holder in relationships,\u201d he explained to in his British Vogue profile. \u201cI had a boyfriend who wasn\u2019t experienced at holding hands in public. We got heckled in London. But that kind of behaviour is now outweighed by the smiles you get.\u201d",
      "Bailey didn't disclose to British Vogue whether he's in a relationship currently, but he was open to talking about wanting to have children. However, he believes now is not the right time for him.",
      "\"I want to make sure I\u2019m going to be present. I\u2019m reading books on adoption. I might coparent with a woman, but I\u2019m thinking it will be with a man,\" Bailey said."

      "\u201cFor reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow\u2019s political culture by demolishing yesterday\u2019s, Donald Trump is TIME\u2019s 2016 Person of the Year,\u201d managing editor Gibbs wrote in the magazine.",

She was a solo protester with a hand-painted sign 14 months ago. She\u2019s now led millions of people around the world, 150 countries, to act on behalf of the planet, and she\u2019s really been a key driver this year taking this issue from backstage to center.\u201d",

      "In response to Zelenskyy's actions and Ukraine not backing down, Time's Felsenthal thought it would be good to give Zelenskyy his flowers.",
      "\u201cWhether one looks at this story of Ukraine with a sense of hope or a sense of fear, and the story is, of course, not fully written yet ... Zelenskyy has really galvanized the world in a way we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d he said.",

      "In an introduction, Time\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs explained why Swift was given this honor.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift found a way to transcend borders and be a source of light,\u201d Jacobs\u2019 piece reads. \u201cNo one else on the planet today can move so many people so well. Achieving this feat is something we often chalk up to the alignments of planets and fates, but giving too much credit to the stars ignores her skill and her power. Swift is the rare person who is both the writer and hero of her own story.\u201d",
      "2024: Donald Trump",

      "\u201cThis is someone who made a historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who\u2019s reordering American politics. It\u2019s hard to argue with the fact that the person who is moving into the Oval Office is the most influential person in the news,\u201d Time Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs said on TODAY.",
      "Trump has vowed to deport millions of migrants, slash parts of the federal government and slap tariffs on foreign goods to boost American businesses. He also told Time one of his first acts will be to pardon rioters from Jan. 6 who were convicted for crimes involving storming the Capitol."

      "In February, Netflix announced that the 40-year-old interior designer would be replacing Bobby Berk on the series. Now, with Season Nine out on Netflix as of Dec. 11, the Fab Five members talk to TODAY.com about how Brent helped the series enter its renaissance era.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how after I thought, when we did seven years, that you can\u2019t really go back,\u201d Tan France says. \u201cBut after seven years of doing your job, it\u2019s so hard to feel renewed energy again. And I was like, \u2018OK, this is our sunset era, like this might be done.\u2019",
      "\"And then, as soon as we started shooting again, and Jeremiah reminded us all of just how special it is, what we\u2019re doing \u2026 it felt like the first day of joy again,\" he continues.",
      "In November 2023, Berk announced with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d that Season Eight would be his last on \"Queer Eye,\" which was rebooted in 2018 with a new cast after the initial run of Bravo's \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" in the early 2000s. The design expert explained the reason for his departure in a January 2024 Vanity Fair interview and confirmed that there had been tension between him and his co-star France.",
      "That, paired with an explosive Rolling Stone expos\u00e9 in March that alleged controversy between the \"Queer Eye\" members, left them in a difficult place as they began to film Season Nine. But Jonathan Van Ness recalls Brent showing up to shoot in March and creating a \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d space.",
      "\u201cJeremiah really just went out of his way to be like, 'You\u2019re safe here,'\" the stylist describes. \"He gave us all of these quartz just to signify transparency and openness and safety and, like, I\u2019m a big rock girl.\"",
      "Brent also acknowledges his love of crystals during the first episode of Season Nine, which takes place in Las Vegas.",
      "Karamo Brown chimes in to say he's ready for \"another seven years\" of the series as they start this new beginning with Brent, who feels just as excited about his new \"family.\"",
      "Brent says that he hopes the new season reminds viewers of how \u201cgreat\u201d his castmates are.",
      "\"I sat there every day (of filming) in complete awe of what they do, you know, watching people create, love, connect, share, build, grow. It was just wild,\" Brent recalls. \"And they're so much better than you think they are, like, they're even better.\"",
      "\"Queer Eye,\" which centers around improving the lives of people with moving backstories, premiered six years ago with France, Berk, Van Ness, Brown and Antoni Porowski. In Season Nine, Brent brings his interior design experience to the table, which is just one piece of his already impressive resume that includes starring in several TV series alongside his husband, Nate Berkus, and authoring his first book, \"The Space That Keeps You.\"",
      "In a December episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\u201d Brent revealed that he had no contact with Berk after he was announced as his replacement, and that they\u2019ve never met.",
      "During his TODAY.com interview, Brent says it \"was not hard\" to jump right into his inaugural season of \"Queer Eye,\" due to his co-stars being masters of their specific trades.",
      "\"My only job when I started here was making sure that they knew that I was going to earn their trust,\" he says, to which Brown responds, \"And did he do the work.\""

I\u2019m 31 now, and it kind of covers that chunk of my life. Naturally, we kind of look a little more introspectively into ourselves and analyze where we\u2019re at, and what we love about our life and our surroundings, and then what we want to kind of evolve into.",
      "What was it like to work with an all-woman team for this record?",
      "I was lucky enough to work with only women on this record \u2014 four of them, Jessie Jo Dillon, Karen Fairchild, Hillary Lindsey, and Alysa Vanderheym. And the reason that came to be \u2014 it was not this pre-calculated idea. I honestly knew that to start writing a record, I needed to feel safe, and so I called my friends, who just happened to be incredible pillars in music. We went away to a retreat outside of St. Louis, and it was just womanhood with some wine. A lot of music came out of it, and that is \u201cPatterns.\u201d",

Listen, I know that I\u2019m the girl. I know that I\u2019m new. I know you guys have like, 85 years on me. That\u2019s the vibe.",

When my friends come over, I\u2019m always just like, \u201cWhat do you want to eat, to drink? Like, what do you need? Sweatpants? What can I get you?\u201d I think that\u2019s part of my love language.",

I want to give this record a life for the first time, and to do it on that stage at MSG, which I\u2019ve never played before ... I mean, it\u2019s one for the books. For me, I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my life.",

Whether you\u2019re more connected to yourself, or the person that you\u2019re with, or us on stage, I just want you to feel connected. And so we\u2019ve really tried to curate the whole night to feel like that.",

So I wonder how that works. I should talk to an astrologist about that.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 18:58:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The hit Christmas song by Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born out of loneliness. Learn the 'Feliz Navidad' lyrics in English and Spanish, and the song's history.",
    "story": [
      "I stared out the car window as my mom drove our Dodge Dart through the desert night. I was 10 years old, and my family was on a trip from Los Angeles to El Paso, Texas, to visit my grandpa for the holidays. Beside my mom, Aunt Emma was asleep in the front seat, and so were my brothers next to me in the back. Then the AM radio crackled. \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d a man sang. \u201cI wanna wish you a merry Christmas, from the bottom of my heart!\u201d",
      "My mother hummed along with the melody. That song seemed like a beacon, the sound of people like us coming over the airwaves. We were in an old car on a dark road in the middle of nowhere. But with my family so close, and \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d on the radio, it felt like the safest place in the world.",
      "As a kid in the 1970s, I assumed that the voice behind \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was Mexican American like me. In fact, singer Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born in 1945 in Puerto Rico. He wrote \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d in 10 minutes and recorded it in one take, he once told The New Yorker. The novelty song that has become a holiday staple was released in 1970, when Richard Nixon was president, the Vietnam War was raging, and Hispanic Heritage Month didn\u2019t exist yet.",
      "For Feliciano, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d represented a comeback. After coming to prominence with his rendition of \u201cLight My Fire\u201d in 1968, he performed an unconventional version of the national anthem at the World Series. This generated a backlash that nearly derailed his career. Luckily, two years later Feliciano charmed his way back into the public eye with \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "Although I grew up in an assimilated household, where my family spoke English at home, it was still special to hear Feliciano\u2019s bilingual song every year. Before Latinos were a regular presence on TV and radio, we would hear him and feel like, in a sense, he was us.",
      "I was in sixth grade the year that my older brother got a movie camera for Christmas. His present sparked a performance in our living room by my Aunt Lela, the free spirit of the family. Wearing a cape fashioned from wrapping paper, she belted out her own version of \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is my first live Christmas special!\u201d she exclaimed. My cousins and I clapped along as the adults rolled their eyes. \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was perfect for my aunt \u2014 and for everyone \u2014 because anybody can sing it.",
      "The genius of \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d is its simplicity. It has only 19 words, 13 in English and six in Spanish. (The English: I wanna wish you a merry Christmas/ From the bottom of my heart. The Spanish: Feliz Navidad/ Pr\u00f3spero a\u00f1o y felicidad. Translated, it means merry Christmas and happy new year.) Feliciano repeats them for three minutes, long enough to craft a bouncy earworm. If you listen closely, you can hear the strings of the cuatro, an instrument derived from the guitar that often accompanies Christmas carols in Puerto Rico.",
      "Like \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d by Mariah Carey, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d has become one of the best-known holiday songs of all time. It has been covered by artists including Luciano Pavarotti, Celine Dion and Latin superstar Thalia. For many Latinos, it is not officially the Christmas season until we\u2019ve heard this song.",
      "Ironically, Feliciano has stated in interviews that this song was born of loneliness. He was in an L.A. studio over the holidays, missing his family, when he wrote and recorded it.",
      "I learned what it was like to feel melancholy at Christmas in 2020, during the pandemic. Instead of spending the holidays in California with my family, I stayed home in New York City. I took solo walks in Central Park and stared out the window a lot. One day, I was so lonely that I went and sat at the bus stop even though I wasn\u2019t even waiting for a bus.",
      "In the evenings, when I listened to streaming radio, there was \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d It was only then that I detected a yearning in Feliciano\u2019s voice. That year, the song struck me as bittersweet; it made me miss my relatives more, while simultaneously reminding me of happier times.",
      "It\u2019s now been over five decades since Feliciano released \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d Yet he will always be the original crossover artist who brought Latin sounds into the mainstream, and his most famous song remains the only Spanish-language Christmas classic in the U.S.",
      "These days, when I hear \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d it can call up all kinds of emotions. I think of my mom humming to herself, back when a long car trip was a big adventure. I remember my childhood Christmases with my cousins, aunts and my grandpa. I reflect on how amazing it is that this snappy tune has been an annual presence in my life for nearly as long as I\u2019ve been alive. And sometimes, I don\u2019t think about any of these things. I just sing along."

      "When Jamie Foxx experienced \u201ca bad headache,\u201d on April 11, 2023, he visited a doctor who didn\u2019t take his symptoms seriously, giving him a shot of cortisone and sending him on his way, he shared during his stand-up special \u201cJamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was\u2026\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can do Yelps for doctors,\u201d he said in his special. \u201cThat\u2019s half a star.\u201d",

      "Brain aneurysms are common, TODAY.com previously reported, and many are harmless. However, ones that rupture and bleed, like the one Foxx had, are medical emergencies that require immediate surgery. Bleeding in the brain, also called intracranial hemorrhage, is considered a stroke, the Cleveland Clinic notes. The blood that collects in the brain makes it difficult for oxygen to reach the brain.",
      "According to the Cleveland Clinic symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm include:",

      "Hussain noted that some people hesitate to visit the hospital because of a headache. However skipping medical care can lead to death in 25% of people with ruptured aneurysms. Even survivors face life-altering changes with about one-third of survivors experiencing severe disability, past TODAY.com reporting says.",
      "\u201cWe heard the story too often where someone had a really bad headache \u2026 and didn\u2019t have any other symptoms \u2026 and unfortunately they wait because they think, \u2018Oh, maybe it\u2019s just a bad headache, a bad migraine,\u201d Hussain said. \u201cThen a day or two later, the aneurysm fully ruptures, you have the mask of bleeding around the brain, and it can be quite devastating.\u201d",
      "In Foxx\u2019s case, his sister\u2019s determination likely made a difference in his outcome.",
      "\u201cMy sister \u2026 said that something\u2019s wrong with my brother,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cThey said she drove around Atlanta sort of aimlessly. She didn\u2019t really know where the hospitals was, but as she was driving around she came upon Piedmont hospital.\u201d",
      "Her instinct about Foxx was right. The doctor at this hospital who evaluated him gave Dixon \u201csome horrible news.\u201d",

      "Family and friends of the Missouri man who was imprisoned in Syria after he said he crossed into the country on a \"pilgrimage\" to Damascus hailed his unexpected recovery as a \"Christmas miracle\" on Thursday after about seven months with no contact.",
      "\"We're very blessed that he is safe, that he is good, that he is protected,\" Pixie Rogers said of her brother, Travis Timmerman. \"And I saw on the news that he got fed.\"",
      "Timmerman, 29, who is from Urbana, Missouri, a small community north of Springfield, initially identified himself only as \"Travis\" in a video that emerged overnight that led some to misidentify him as missing American journalist\u00a0Austin Tice, 43.",
      "But Timmerman's family said that he, too, had been missing, although they had no clue he was in Syria.",
      "\"I'm not sure what his thinking was in that,\" Rogers said of her brother entering a country in conflict. \"I wouldn't think he'd do something like that.\"",
      "She said his family knew he was going to travel to Prague, the Czech capital, and then Hungary. His mother, Stacey Collins Gardiner, said he wanted to write during his trip and learn more about God and religion.",
      "Gardiner told NBC affiliate KSHB of Kansas City that the trip overseas in March was his first time out of the country and that she initially didn't know any details about his itinerary. Up until then, Timmerman was living with her and his stepfather after having gone to law school at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and moved to Chicago.",
      "While abroad, he called about three times a week, she said.",
      "\"Called me end of May and says, 'Mom, I'm going to be somewhere where I won't have no internet.' And I said, 'How long, a week or two?' And he said, 'I don't know, but I'll give you a call,'\" Gardiner said. \"And that's all I know.\"",
      "But contact dried up, and the family worried his laptop and cellphone may have been stolen.",
      "Only in recent weeks, Rogers said, after Missouri law enforcement was able to get in contact with U.S. Embassy officials in Hungary did the family learn Timmerman was in Lebanon.",
      "Gardiner said she was heartbroken these past months without any word from her son, one of her four children.",
      "\"I had happy tears,\" she said upon learning he was alive Thursday.",
      "\"It was a relief to find out he was still alive, because he's my baby,\" she added.",
      "Don Kelderhouse, the pastor of Preston Bible Baptist Church, in Preston, Missouri, where Timmerman attends services, said he knew of his plans to travel to Eastern Europe, but not the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe thought it might be a month or two that he\u2019d be gone,\u201d Kelderhouse said, adding, \u201cWe thought the money would run out and he\u2019d go home. We didn\u2019t know if he was dead or alive.\u201d",
      "Authorities in Missouri and Budapest, the Hungarian capital, put out a missing persons report for a man named Pete Timmerman, with Hungarian police identifying him as \"Travis\" Pete Timmerman.",
      "The Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a public awareness bulletin that Timmerman had gone missing from Budapest on May 28.",
      "Timmerman told reporters that he was stopped by Syrian officials earlier this year after crossing into the country on foot.",
      "\"I was on a pilgrimage to Damascus,\" he told NBC News in a building on the outskirts of the capital. He said he had spent three days living in a mountain area around the border between Lebanon and Syria \"without food and water\" before he was spotted by a border guard and detained.",
      "Timmerman said he was imprisoned by the regime for months during which \u201cI was fed well, I always had water, the only difficulty was not being able to go to the bathroom\" regularly.",
      "He was then released by rebel forces as they broke into prisons across the country to free detainees.",
      "Timmerman said he spent the past few days wandering the streets barefoot, sleeping outside and in an abandoned house. He was then found once again by a local resident he had asked for water, subsequently appearing in the video that quickly spread across social media and drew the news media\u2019s attention.",
      "After being located by NBC News and other outlets in Dhiyabia, Timmerman said he had \"been reading the scripture a lot\" before deciding to cross the mountains from Lebanon into Syria.",
      "Kelderhouse said that Timmerman became baptized in the church about a year and half ago and had been eager to share his faith. He said he also has a law degree and had been writing, and the idea of him traveling across Eastern Europe to share his beliefs and learn more about the world didn't strike him as odd. But the risk he took by going to Syria was surprising, he added.",
      "\"God must have a plan for his life,\" Kelderhouse said. \"He kept him alive.\"",
      "Kayle Owens, a classmate of Timmerman's at Skyline High School in Urbana, a town of about 400 people, said he had played football and made \"many lifelong friendships at our school.\"",
      "When friends learned he was missing, they prayed.",
      "\"It truly is a Christmas miracle,\" Owens said. \"We've been praying tirelessly for his safe return, and those prayers have been answered.\""

      "With the balance of power in northern Syria swinging toward the rebels who toppled the Assad regime, U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and their ability to contain ISIS may now be under threat.",
      "The Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 which helped the U.S. beat back the Islamic State terrorist group and currently holds thousands of captured ISIS fighters \u2014 accepted a cease-fire Tuesday with the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), ceding control of the northern city of Manbij, a Kurdish stronghold.",
      "\u201cWe have reached a ceasefire agreement in Manbij with American mediation, to preserve the security and safety of civilians,\u201d the SDF's general commander, Mazloum Abdi, said Tuesday in a post on X. \u201cFighters \u2026 will be removed from the area as soon as possible. Our goal is to cease fire throughout Syria and enter into a political process for the future of the country.\u201d",
      "The takeover of Manbij, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 or HTS, which has roots in extremist Islamist movements \u2014 reflects the rapidly shifting situation across Syria, including for Kurdish forces.",

      "Erdo\u011fan is HTS\u2019s key backer. He has long viewed the SDF as an extension of Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and designates both as terrorist organizations. And while Syria\u2019s Kurds have, since 2011, largely defended their autonomy in the northeastern corner of Syria that borders Turkey and Iraq, the political winds have shifted against the SDF.",
      "\u201cThe Kurds in Syria, after many years of autonomous rule, are in probably the most precarious and volatile environment since they developed those structures,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow on the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "Kurdish forces have made arrangements with several different groups over the past decade, Mansour told NBC News, but \u201cthis colossal change in Syria will see them have to renegotiate this, and probably negotiations will be through violence.\u201d",
      "It took U.S. mediation to broker an armistice between the SDF and the SNA, amid a visit from Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, and before Secretary of State Anthony Blinken\u2019s trip to Turkey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked alongside the SDF for some time. That work continues,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in Japan on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a good relationship with them, and I think it will remain.\u201d",
      "But the words of America\u2019s incoming president will not have escaped the attention of the SDF leadership.",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d President-elect Donald Trump said in a post on X last week, adding in all caps: \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "The early signs from the incoming Trump administration are that there will be two schools of thought regarding Syria, Mansour said. \u201cOne camp recognizes the historic fight with the Kurds against ISIS \u2026 and of course the other camp \u2014 where Trump probably lands \u2014 is to try and move out of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "There are thought to be thousands of ISIS fighters being held in prisons and internally displaced person camps monitored by Kurdish groups and U.S. forces in Syria\u2019s northeast \u2014 an area that used to constitute part of the Islamic State\u2019s territory.",
      "If a second Trump administration were to pull out of Syria, it would leave Kurdish forces without a major international ally. HTS and its allies, meanwhile, have the backing of Turkey and Erdo\u011fan, who on Monday welcomed ejection of \u201cterrorists\u201d from Manbij, according to Reuters.",
      "There are already signals of further clashes. Kobani, to the northeast of Manbij, \u201cremains at risk of war due to continuous provocations by Turkey and its jihadist mercenaries,\u201d SDF media chief Farhad Shami told NBC News on Wednesday."

      "HTS is banned as a terrorist organization in the United States and elsewhere and grew out of a branch of\u00a0 Al Qaeda. Its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, said a decade ago that there would be no room for religious minorities in the Islamist Syria of which he dreamed about. He also suggested that he could bring terrorism to the West unless it withdrew from the Middle East\u2019s wars.",
      "More recently, however, Jolani, who now uses his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has undergone something of a rebrand, trimming his beard, donning Westernized green fatigues and espousing tolerance for all of Syria\u2019s myriad faiths. Nevertheless plenty of observers are reserving judgment until these words become actions.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very cautious of him,\u201d said Bilal Sukkar, a Syrian-born senior associate with the London-based intelligence consultancy S-RM. That trepidation goes for \u201cnot only respecting the rights of people belonging to other religious and sectarian groups,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actually looking at them as equal citizens.\u201d",
      "Seeing Syria\u2019s corridors of power welcome a flag \u201cindicating Islamist-Salafist leanings\u201d has \u201cput people on alert,\u201d Sukkar said. Although he does not think deploying the emblem was a \u201cwise\u201d move, he sees it as more reflective of the rebels\u2019 origins in Idlib rather than anything else.",
      "Such demographic accommodations are a huge deal in Syria, which is \u201chome to a vast diversity of religious and ethnic groups,\u201d according to the Harvard Divinity School. Some 74% of the population are Sunni Muslims, another 13% belong to other sects, such as Shia and Alawite, and 10% are Christian.",
      "The classic worry among Western foreign policy watchers was that Assad might be toppled but replaced by something that is not much better: an extremist terror group.",
      "Assad\u2019s regime was, rightly or wrongly, seen internationally as one of brutal secularism and relative interreligious tolerance. By contrast, HTS has in the past explicitly defined itself as Islamist, meaning it seeks to reorder society along Islamic law.",
      "Displaying the flag in an image meant to represent Syria\u2019s new transition government shows how HTS and Jolani are still \u201cdeeply entrenched in their Salafist-Sunni ideology and worldview,\u201d according to Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics and author of the 2024 book, \u201cWhat Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "They are not going to rule Syria with the brutality of the Islamic State terrorist group or the Taliban, Gerges added, \u201cbut it would be disingenuous to say he has shedded his ideology.\u201d",
      "Gerges is among observers who see the presence of the flag as a signal that the militant group is intent on keeping its imprimatur on the new era it helped birth. Al-Bashir, chosen after a meeting with Jolani, says he will only be in post until March. But it\u2019s not clear what happens then.",
      "There have been positive early signals, including an edict that women should not be told what they can and cannot wear, as well as a plea for people not to seek vigilante vengeance.",
      "\u201cWe will guarantee the rights of all people and all communities in Syria,\u201d al-Bashir told the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Tuesday. Asked whether the country\u2019s new Constitution would be \u201cIslamic,\u201d he added, \u201cGod willing, we will clarify all these details during the constitutional process.\u201d",
      "With the group now making more moderate noises, and also in a position of considerable influence, the United States is exploring removing HTS\u2019 terrorist designation, two current administration officials and a former senior U.S. official told NBC News. Although Washington will watch closely the militant group\u2019s moves from its new political vantage point.",
      "Some observers, such as Gerges, see the interim prime minister as little more than an Jolani figurehead.",
      "Even inside Syria, he is not a well-known figure. Previously, he ran the government in Idlib province, a small, rural corner of northwestern Syria where rebels maintained control outside Assad\u2019s regime until their stunning offensive.",
      "He heads what is being touted by the incoming officials as a technocratic government; he is a trained electrical engineer and has previously backed the digitization of Idlib\u2019s public services.",
      "He and his officials are now going about the process of auditing and stripping back what they and independent international watchdogs say was a deeply corrupt regime.",
      "Gerges worries that HTS and its leader have already amassed such power that they may be reluctant to relinquish it, and that there is little sign of checks or balances to contain Jolani\u2019s ambitions now that Assad has been toppled.",
      "Syria may be getting \u201crid of a strongman,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cand replacing him with another strongman.\u201d"

    "summary": "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, after the swift collapse of the Syrian leader's regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there \u201cin the most secure way possible\u201d after the swift collapse of his regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHe is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov said, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad\u2019s presence in the country.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what is going on with him right now,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it \u201cwould be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has been dealt a huge blow by the collapse of a regime to which he gave his full support, helping Assad cling to power after Syria descended into civil war and maintain his family\u2019s brutal dynasty, which began in 1971.",
      "And Ryabkov said Russia would continue to support the Syrian leader whose regime has been accused by human rights groups, whistleblowers and former detainees of attacks with chemical weapons and barrel bombs and other war crimes, as well as murder, systematic torture and the enforced disappearance of tens of thousands of people since the 2011 mass uprising, which sparked that conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court,\u201d Ryabkov said when asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial.",
      "Syria has not joined the court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands, and has not accepted its jurisdiction. Russia and China blocked an attempt to impose its jurisdiction in 2014. The United States and Israel also do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants.",
      "Separately, in March 2023, the court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for \u201cwar crimes\u201d in overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children\u00a0from Ukraine to Russia.",
      "And last month, the ICC issued\u00a0arrest warrants\u00a0for Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0and his former Defense Minister\u00a0Yoav Gallant over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Israel\u00a0rejected the charges and the U.S. said it rejected the decision.",
      "Assad \u201cwas accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it was \u201camazing, but it is also very revealing,\u201d that the U.S. \u201cconfigures its reaction and response\u201d depending on whom the court is prosecuting.",
      "Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham\u00a0(HTS) militant group, which led rebel forces as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia \u201cforcefully and strongly\u201d believes that Syria \u201cshould be sovereign, unified and integral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,\u201d he added.",
      "He also urged Israel \u201cto seriously consider what is going on in the Golan Heights,\u201d after Netanyahu ordered his military to seize control of the demilitarized and U.N.-patrolled buffer zone with Syria that was established under a 1974 cease-fire agreement. Israel, Ryabkov said, should observe that agreement and it should \u201cnot infringe\u201d on Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "One thing Russia did share with the U.S. was concerns about the potential for the re-emergence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria, he said.\u00a0The U.S. has launched multiple airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, where it maintains a small force.",
      "On a separate matter, Ryabkov added that the Kremlin would \u201cdefinitely be prepared to consider\u201d another prisoner swap, similar to the one in August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and three other U.S. residents from Russian captivity.",
      "Deals like this required \u201ca multiphased or multistep approach on both sides,\u201d including in some cases, the pardoning of those serving sentences. Several other countries, including Germany and Slovenia, were involved in the deal mediated by Turkey.",
      "While he did not \u201cwant to pre-empt anything,\u201d Ryabkov said such deals help improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S., adding that a new deal would be \"a healthy step forward, especially at the beginning of the next administration.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe hold Bashar al-Assad and his criminal regime accountable for the consequences of Austin\u2019s disappearance and the pain inflicted on his mother \u2014 pain, tears and separation,\" Obaida Al-Arnaot, official spokesperson and head of the political affairs department of Syria\u2019s interim government, said in an interview Wednesday.",

      "The last time he saw Tice was in July 2022, said Ahmad, who described Tice as appearing to be in \"somewhat good\" condition.",
      "However, he said, \"he was thin when I saw him. His neck bones were slightly protruding, but he was able to walk and move because they allowed him and other prisoners to exercise and walk for one hour in the prison corridor.\"",
      "Generally, Ahmad said, the conditions foreign prisoners were held in were \"excellent\" compared with those endured by Syrian prisoners, and he said Tice appeared to be held in a large cell alone.",
      "With Assad overthrown by rebel forces, Tice's family has expressed renewed hope that they will be reunited with their son.",
      "In an interview with \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt,\" Tice's parents, Debra and Marc Tice, said they had received information that before the rebels ousted Assad's government, their son not only was alive but was being well cared-for. However, they said, they had no clarity about who was holding their son.",

The announcement comes a week after the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case involving state bans on puberty-suppressing medication and other forms of transition-related care for minors.",
      "Puberty blockers are commonly prescribed to transgender children in countries throughout the Western world to delay the onset of puberty or pause it as it is transpiring. The medication is prescribed with the goal of giving children who are experiencing gender dysphoria more time to decide if they want to take more permanent steps to transition genders. Puberty resumes when the medication is no longer taken.",
      "The indefinite ban on the medication in Britain comes several months after an independent study commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service concluded that the medical evidence around transition-related care for minors is \u201cremarkably weak\u201d and that more research is needed.",
      "\u201cChildren\u2019s healthcare must always be evidence-led,\u201d British Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said in a press release. \u201cThe independent expert Commission on Human Medicines found that the current prescribing and care pathway for gender dysphoria and incongruence presents an unacceptable safety risk for children and young people.\u201d",
      "Dr. Hilary Cass, the author of the independent study, known as the \u201cCass report,\u201d said she supported the ban, according to the same release.",
      "\u201cPuberty blockers are powerful drugs with unproven benefits and significant risks, and that is why I recommended that they should only be prescribed following a multi-disciplinary assessment and within a research protocol,\u201d she said.",

Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0announcement extends the ban indefinitely as the government begins clinical trials on the medications starting next year. The ban will be revisited in 2027.",

      "Human Rights Watch and other organizations have called out Saudi Arabia for a record of abuse that includes\u00a0imprisoning\u00a0women\u2019s rights campaigners, killing journalist Jamal Kashoggi in 2018 and\u00a0executing\u00a081 people\u00a0in a single day in 2022.",
      "The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was marred by controversy after the deaths of migrant workers who helped build the infrastructure over long periods in extreme heat.",
      "Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of Qatar\u2019s World Cup organizing committee, told Piers Morgan in 2022 that \u201cbetween 400 and 500\u201d migrants died but that he did not \u201chave the exact number.\u201d",
      "The U.S., Mexico and Canada will host the World Cup in 2026. The 48-team tournament will take place in 16 cities from June 11 to July 19.\u00a0The next Women's World Cup will take place in Brazil from June 24 to July 25, 2027."

      "The things whales do for love.",
      "A humpback whale has stunned scientists with a journey that spanned three oceans and more than 8,000 miles, setting the record for the longest known migration between breeding grounds.",
      "Scientists behind the research,\u00a0published Wednesday\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Royal Society Open Science, suggest that the odyssey may be linked to climate change \u2014 which is affecting ocean conditions and depleting food stocks \u2014 or possibly a shift in mating strategies.",
      "\u201cChanging climatic and ocean conditions could be driving these migrations to new breeding grounds. It may also be a case that increased competition for mates or food\u00a0is encouraging individuals to seek new opportunities,\u201d said Darren Croft, professor of behavioral\u00a0ecology at the U.K.\u2019s University\u00a0of Exeter and executive director of the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The new research is an \u201cincredible finding\u201d that emphasizes the \u201cremarkable distances\u201d that this whale species travels, Croft told NBC News in an email on Wednesday.",
      "Some whale migration routes are known to exceed 5,000 miles between feeding and breeding grounds, and humpback whales in particular have some of the longest migrations of any mammal.",
      "But this whale went the extra mile \u2014 or thousand \u2014 in its quest.",
      "The whale was first photographed as part of a group in 2013 off the Pacific coast of Colombia, South America, by a dedicated research vessel.",
      "He was later identified in a similar area in 2017, but in 2022 he was spotted off the coast of Zanzibar, an island in the Indian Ocean that is 22 miles off the coast of east-central Africa.",
      "\u201cTo put it into perspective, this male covered a distance equivalent to swimming from London to Tokyo and then partway back,\u201d said Croft.",
      "Ryan Reisinger, associate professor at the U.K.\u2019s University of Southampton and the new report's handling editor, said that \u201cit was really exciting\u201d when he first saw the findings.",
      "The research provided \u201cphotographic evidence that confirmed humpback whales switch between breeding grounds,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.",
      "The exact reason behind this particularly long migration remains unclear.",
      "But it is understood that humpback whales travel annually from cooler feeding grounds in the summer where there is an abundance of food to warmer breeding grounds in the winter that are \u201cmore suitable for giving birth, but relatively scarce in food,\u201d said Luke Rendell, a lecturer in biology at the U.K.\u2019s University of St Andrews.",
      "The new findings are based on photos submitted to the citizen science website, happywhale.com, where researchers, whale watchers and members of the public map the movement of whales around the world\u2019s oceans.",
      "\u201cThis creates a massive network of sensors, where people are observing and reporting\u201d sightings of whales around the globe, Reisinger said.",
      "\u201cIndividual research teams can\u2019t get everywhere they need to go, especially for marine mammals, which are difficult to observe,\u201d Reisinger explained.",
      "The database uses artificial intelligence to analyze the submitted photos and identify individual whales based on their unique shapes and markings.",
      "The algorithm \u201cuses the shape, pattern, and features of a whale\u2019s tail,\u201d known as a fluke, to identify individual whales, according to Happy Whale\u2019s website. The organization claims that a humpback whale\u2019s tail is so unique that there is a \u201c97% to 99%\u201d success rate for matching photos submitted for the species."

      "The Ivy league tech graduate charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City made multiple visits to Japan this year, according to those who spoke with him.",
      "During one of his visits, on Feb. 25, the suspect, Luigi Mangione, 26, entered a restaurant in Tokyo where he sat at the counter, said Obara Jun, a Japanese poker player who saw Mangione struggle with ordering in the restaurant.",
      "\u201cHe was very friendly, and it didn\u2019t take long for us to get to know each other,\u201d Jun said via text message Wednesday.",
      "Jun posted a picture with Mangione to X the night they met, but he identified the man he spoke with as Mangione only after his face was plastered all over social media this week as the suspect in Thompson\u2019s murder.",
      "Jun said he was drinking with a friend at the bar and then invited the seemingly friendly American to his table. \u201cHe was very happy to sit at our table,\u201d Jun recalled, saying he told Mangione he would treat him to some food and drinks.",
      "Jun recalled Mangione as being on vacation from Hawaii and said that \u201che was very smart and that he graduated from a prestigious university.\u201d",
      "Mangione \u201ctold me that he loves Japan and Japanese culture,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was very friendly, and we followed each other on Twitter, enjoyed a meal together for a while, and then we parted ways,\u201d Jun added.",
      "But a month later, Mangione was describing Japan as lacking free will and proposed solutions for solving its demographic crisis.",
      "He said the solution to the country\u2019s falling birth rates wasn\u2019t immigration but \u201ccultural.\u201d",

      "\u201cModern Japanese urban environment is an evolutionary mismatch for the human animal,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He also proposed replacing video game caf\u00e9s with athletics in school.",
      "Meanwhile, Mangione was also messaging Gurwinder Bhogal, who runs a Substack newsletter about the social impact of technology, which Mangione subscribed to and was a \u201clongtime fan\u201d of.",
      "Mangione was a \u201cfounding member of my Substack, and someone I\u2019ve been friendly with for a while,\u201d Bhogal said in a Substack post this week, adding, \u201cI hope there\u2019s been some kind of a mix-up, because this doesn\u2019t seem like him at all.\u201d",
      "Despite his gripes with Japan, Mangione emailed Bhogal about his visits there and said he was planning another visit to the country in early May, Bhogal said.",
      "It was not clear how many visits Mangione made to Japan or the total time he spent in the country.",
      "\u201cJapan is peak NPC-ville,\u201d Mangione said April 16 in an email to Bhogal shared on X, using a term that refers to preprogrammed non-player video game characters and which is at times used as a derogatory slang.",
      "\u201cScary lack of free will in this country,\u201d Mangione wrote in the email as he described an incident in which police in Japan did not jaywalk to help a person \u201cseizing on the ground.\u201d",
      "Mangione had an \u201ceclectic range of concerns,\u201d Bhogal said on X.",
      "\u201cThe main impression I got of Luigi when I spoke with him was that he was a deeply curious individual,\u201d Bhogal said."
