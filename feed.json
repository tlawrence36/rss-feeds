      "With his surprise-dropped \u201cGNX,\u201d Kendrick Lamar roars from zero to 60 faster than a turbocharged \u201987 Buick",
      "With his surprise-dropped \u201cGNX,\u201d Kendrick Lamar roars from zero to 60 faster than a turbocharged \u201987 Buick, faster than you can shout \u201cMustaaaaard.\u201d And waaaaay faster than you can decode the dense biblical centerpiece \u201cReincarnated.\u201d",
      "Keeping the same energy of his landmark Pop Out concert five months ago, Lamar surrounds himself with up-and-coming Los Angeles artists \u2014 from AzChike to Peysoh \u2014 and raps over thumping New West Coast soundscapes shaped by his longtime producer Sounwave, along with Jack Antonoff and a garageful of other beat mechanics. He\u2019s once again \u201cpossessed by a spirit,\u201d sprinkling 2Pac, Biggie and Nas references throughout and maintaining a me-against-the-world antipathy that includes but extends well beyond a certain Canadian: \u201cI just strangled me a GOAT\u201d and \u201cnow it\u2019s plural.\u201d",
      "Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Andrew Schulz, and even Fox\u2019s Super Bowl broadcast can\u2019t escape K-Dot\u2019s chaotic crosshairs. Here\u2019s hoping the chorus of \u201ctv off\u201d \u2014 an urgent call to \u201cturn this TV off\u201d repeated eight times \u2014 confuses the masses during his New Orleans halftime show in February.",
      "This is Lamar leaning into the same creativity-juicing pride, self-righteous anger and supreme confidence that fueled the Grammy-nominated \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and won his Drake feud: \u201cI kill \u2018em all before I let \u2018em kill my joy.\u201d And yet, as with his first-ever hit \u201cSwimming Pools (Drank),\u201d even the most club-ready braggadocio songs \u2014 and there are plenty, including the massive \u201csquabble up\u201d and synth-stabbed Mustard production \u201chey now\u201d \u2014 are slapped with a caution sticker. Introspection is baked into Lamar\u2019s art. In \u201cman at the garden,\u201d he\u2019s surveying his kingdom and glory and declares that while \u201cI deserve it all,\u201d \u201cdangerously / nothing changed with me / still got pain in me.\u201d",
      "At age 37, Lamar remains in peak form (that breath control!) and stands alone in the rap world as a star who bridges generations without chasing trends. He generates his own gravity in the hip-hop universe. Pulling samples from the early \u201980s \u2014 Debbie Deb, Luther Vandross, Whodini \u2014 he\u2019s able to switch cadences and lyrical perspectives mid-song without ever losing the listener.",
      "Album closer \u201cgloria,\u201d one of two tracks featuring former TDE labelmate SZA, is a glorious celebration of the pain and power of writing. In the vein of Common\u2019s \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d or Nas\u2019 \u201cI Gave You Power,\u201d Lamar\u2019s love story details a \u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d that listeners at first may think is about his longtime partner Whitney Alford, but turns out to be dedicated to his pen.",
      "While carefully structured, \u201cGNX\u201d feels a bit more scattershot than Lamar\u2019s traditionally concept-heavy studio albums. And there are hints that this collection of 12 songs is more of a \u201cPart 1\u201d or mixtape-type prelude to something more formal: The brief music video announcing the album features a snippet of a song that doesn\u2019t even appear on \u201cGNX.\u201d",
      "Whatever comes next, the Pulitzer Prize winner has written another thrilling chapter in what remains the most fascinating longform story in hip-hop: an ambitious and searingly talented poet from Compton working through his \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 contradictions on the biggest stage, forever discomforted by his crown. ___",

      "A judge says he\u2019ll rule next week on Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 third request to be released from jail on bail while he awaits his sex trafficking trial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs ' lawyers tried for a third time Friday to persuade a judge to let the hip-hop mogul out of jail while he awaits his sex trafficking trial, but a decision won\u2019t come until next week as prosecutors warned of his \"concerted effort\" from behind bars to disrupt the case.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said he'll rule promptly on Combs\u2019 bail request after the defense and prosecution file letters by noon Monday fleshing out some of the arguments they made during at a two-hour hearing in Manhattan federal court.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers pitched having him await trial under around-the-clock surveillance either at his mansion on an island near Miami Beach or \u2014 after the judge scoffed at that location \u2014 at an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.",
      "Their $50 million bail proposal, secured by his Florida home, essentially amounts to keeping Combs on house arrest instead of in custody at the troubled Brooklyn federal jail where he\u2019s been held for 67 days since his September arrest.",
      "Under their plan, Combs' lawyers said he'll be under near-total restrictions on his ability to see or contact anyone but them. But prosecutors argued that no bail conditions can mitigate Combs' \u201crisk of obstruction and dangerousness to others.\u201d",
      "Combs has routinely flouted jail rules while locked up at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, prosecutors said, accusing him of attempting to interfere with witnesses and taint the jury pool.",
      "\u201cReally, this amounts to the defendant paying his way out of custody,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik told Subramanian.",
      "Defense lawyer Anthony Ricco countered that the prosecution\u2019s portrayal of Combs as \"a lawless person who doesn\u2019t follow instructions\u201d or \u201can out-of-control individual who has to be detained\u201d is inaccurate.",
      "Another Combs lawyer, Teny Geragos, added that given the strict release conditions they've proposed, \u201cit would be impossible for him not to follow rules.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "His trial is slated to begin May 5.",
      "Two other judges previously concluded that the Bad Boy Records founder would be a danger to the community if he is freed, and an appeals court judge last month denied Combs\u2019 immediate release while a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals weighs his bail request.",
      "Friday's hearing was the second time Combs was in court this week. On Tuesday, a judge blocked prosecutors from using as evidence papers that were seized from his cell during a jail-wide sweep for contraband and weapons.",
      "As he entered through a side door, Combs waved to relatives including his mother and several of his children in the courtroom gallery, tapping his hand to his heart and blowing kisses at them. He then hugged his lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, before sitting at the defense table.",
      "Combs was not handcuffed or shackled and wore a beige jail uniform, occasionally pulling a pair of reading glasses from his pocket as he peered at papers in front of him.",
      "Prosecutors contend that while incarcerated the \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You\u201d singer has orchestrated social media campaigns aimed at influencing potential jurors. They allege that he has also attempted to leak materials he believes would help his case and is contacting potential witnesses via third parties.",
      "\u201cSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,\u201d Slavik argued.",
      "In renewing their push for Combs' release, his lawyers sought to undercut the strength of a potential key piece of evidence: a March 2016 video showing him hitting and kicking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault happened during a \u201cFreak Off,\" an event in which they allege Combs used his \u201cpower and prestige\u201d to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers.",
      "Combs' lawyers said in court papers that newly unearthed evidence refutes that, and that the video, which first aired on CNN in May, was \u201ca minutes-long glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\u201d between Combs and Cassie.",
      "Slavik, responding to defense claims that the recording was manipulated or taken out of context, said prosecutors don\u2019t have the full version because Combs paid hotel staff $100,000 \u201cto make the original video go away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a case about violence,\" Slavik told Subramanian in a final plea to keep Combs locked up. \u201cThe defendant has engaged in physical, sexual and emotional abuse of his romantic partners for years. ... He\u2019s hit. He\u2019s kicked. He\u2019s dragged.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:01:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Alice Brock has died at age 83",
    "story": [
      "Alice Brock has died at age 83",
      "NEW YORK -- Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \u201cAlice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Her death, just a week before Thanksgiving, was announced Friday by Guthrie on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records. Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. Other details were not immediately available.",
      "\u201cThis coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\u201d Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we\u2019d never have another chance to talk together.\u201d",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend, Richard Robbins, were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014 whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant \u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant / Walk right in it\u2019s around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant.",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of the popular culture. \u201cAlice's Restaurant\u201d was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name. Alice Brock would write a memoir, \u201cMy Life as a Restaurant,\u201d and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \u201cMooses Come Walking.\u201d At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband. Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \u201cAlice's Restaurant\u201d advised: \u201cYou can get anything you want\u201d at Alice's Restaurant, \u201cexcepting Alice.\u201d"

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",
      "Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster is expected to rule within 90 days."

      "A Tennessee man who helped two hired killers after they gunned down rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery three years ago has been sentenced to six years probation",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who helped two hired killers after they gunned down rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery will not serve time in prison under a sentence of six years' probation, a judge ruled Friday.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson, 27, pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the shooting. Johnson helped Cornelius Smith Jr. and Justin Johnson, his half-brother, communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities after the daytime ambush.",
      "Justin Johnson was convicted on Sept. 26 of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 35 years. Smith has been charged with first-degree murder and he testified at Justin Johnson's trial, saying they fatally shot Young Dolph.",
      "Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell sentenced Jermarcus Johnson to a six-year diversionary program where he will undergo job training, submit to drug testing, refrain from possessing a gun and serve 20 hours of community service per year. His record could be cleared if he successfully completes the program.",
      "Speaking with reporters after the sentencing, prosecutor Paul Hagerman noted that Jermarcus Johnson had no role in the actual killing of Young Dolph.",
      "\u201cHe was used by his brother,\u201d Hagerman said. \"He is not a criminal.\"",
      "Young Dolph, whose real name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was fatally shot in November 2021 at a bakery located near the house where he grew up. Known for charitable works in Memphis, the 36-year-old rapper and independent music label owner was in the city to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an event that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Justin Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of his artists were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "Hagerman, the prosecutor, told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cnumber two person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "During the hearing where he pleaded guilty, Jermarcus Johnson acknowledged taking possession of a cellphone and car from Justin Johnson. Jermarcus Johnson also identified a photo in which Justin Johnson was wearing the same clothing as one of the two shooters.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson also testified during his half-brother's trial. His lawyer, Josh Corman, said Friday that Jermarcus Johnson \u201cwas put in a bad situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all think it's a fair resolution,\u201d Corman said.",
      "Another man, Hernandez Govan, whom Smith identified as a go-between with Big Jook, has pleaded not guilty to organizing the killing. Govan\u2019s trial has been set for March 10.",
      "Right after the shooting, Makeda's Homemade Cookies turned into a makeshift memorial for Young Dolph, with fans praying in the parking lot and writing messages of condolences and love on plywood covering the shot-out windows. The bakery closed for months but has since reopened.",
      "He also was honored by the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA during a game. Murals of the rapper were painted around the city. A neighborhood street was named after him.",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \u201cKing of Memphis.\u201d He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others.",
      "Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020's \u201cRich Slave\u201d peaking at No. 4."

    "story": [
      "In his sixth season as chief conductor, Kirill Petrenko is leading the Berlin Philharmonic on its 25th U.S. tour and second in three years",
      "NEW YORK -- Kirill Petrenko thought about the challenge of leading the Berlin Philharmonic, perhaps the world\u2019s greatest orchestra.",
      "\u201cA hundred musicians have 100 opinions and 100 expectations \u2014 100 different expectations,\u201d the conductor said.",
      "Stefan Dohr, the principal horn, estimated forming a unified interpretation is even more arduous.",
      "\u201cI think everybody has more than one opinion,\u201d he said.",
      "In his sixth season as chief conductor, Petrenko is leading the orchestra on its 25th U.S. tour and second in three years. There are eight performances from Nov. 15-26 in Washington, D.C.; New York; Boston; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Chicago.",
      "One program includes Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cThe Isle of the Dead,\u201d Korngold\u2019s Violin Concerto and Dvor\u00e1k\u2019s Seventh Symphony. The other is devoted to Bruckner\u2019s Fifth Symphony, a sprawling work of about 80 minutes played to mark the 200th anniversary of the composer's birth in September.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 52 now,\u201d Petrenko said during a Zoom news conference with U.S. media ahead of the tour. \u201cMaybe my previous 10, 20 years were more connected with Mahler, also because of my Jewish heritage, maybe because I also am some sort of outsider \u2014 no home here, no home there. But maybe it will change and now I worked very intensively with this Bruckner.\u201d",
      "Carnegie Hall concerts this week showed breathtaking emotional depth and clarity. Petrenko signaled poignant pauses with nods and cathartic crescendos with arms sweeping sharply as if tennis backhands.",
      "He is the latest in the orchestra's distinguished line of chief conductors that include Hans von B\u00fclow, Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Herbert von Karajan, Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle.",
      "In an age of widespread audio and video streams, live performances remain an unmatched experience. The U.S. is the second-largest market behind Germany for the orchestra\u2019s digital concert hall, launched in 2008-09.",
      "\u201cThe touring is really important because we want to first meet our audiences,\u201d orchestra general manager Andrea Zietzschmann said. \u201cWe are artists, and we have a strong ambassador role.\u201d",
      "Thirty-four nations are represented among the orchestra\u2019s 130 members. There are five Americans, including Noah Bendix-Balgley, one of the three concertmasters.",
      "Petrenko was born in Omsk, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1972 and moved as a teenager to Austria. He came to Berlin after serving as general music director of the Meininger Theater (1999-02), Berlin\u2019s Komische Oper (2002-07) and Munich\u2019s Bavarian State Opera (2013-20). His podium presence in Berlin has matured with familiarity.",
      "\u201cI can trust, and I cannot mention things too much in the rehearsal,\u201d Petrenko said. \u201cMaybe just have a quick look on some occasions, not to stop rehearsal, not to interrupt the music.\u201d",
      "His opinion of Bruckner has evolved.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I came from Russia. Bruckner for me was absolutely -- I couldn\u2019t even touch it. I didn\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I came to Austria, and I had, so to say, my second childhood in Austria, since I was 18, and of course, there I heard a lot of Bruckner. I saw a lot of mountains, high mountains. I visited a lot of special Austrian kitchens and wurst hauses and, yes, I started to understand a little bit.\u201d",
      "Berlin opened its season with the Bruckner on Aug. 23 and before heading to the U.S. played it three more times at Berlin's Philharmonie plus on tour in Salzburg, Austria; London; Lucerne, Switzerland; and Frankfurt, Germany. To prepare, Petrenko listened to a 1942 recording of the orchestra led by Furtw\u00e4ngler.",
      "\u201cWe can be brilliant. We can be perfect. We can be fantastic performers,\u201d Petrenko said, \u201cbut there is some authentic side of one piece, what is today after we lost a lot of traditions, are very, very difficult to achieve, and the historic recordings are helping us.\u201d",
      "For Mahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony, he listens to Bruno Walter\u2019s performances. For Stauss\u2019 \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d it is Erich Kleiber and Clemens Krauss.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely unachievable. You can't do it today like this,\u201d Petrenko said. \u201cYou need to restore \u2014 step by step you need to go back as far as you can go back, to go to the source of this tradition.\u201d",
      "That thought and preparation is noticed by the orchestra.",
      "\"We are now approaching the moment where we do understand what Kirill Petrenko wants without him explaining it most of the time,\u201d Dorn said."

      "The British dancer filed the suit months after Majors was convicted of misdemeanor assault and harassment in connection with an altercation in Manhattan.",
      "During a fight that began in the backseat of a chauffeured car before spilling out into the streets, Jabbari said Majors hit her head with his open hand, twisted her arm behind her back and squeezed her middle finger until it fractured.",
      "Majors claimed Jabbari had flown into a jealous rage and was the aggressor and that he was only trying to regain his phone and get away safely.",
      "Majors avoided jail time but was ordered by a judge in April to complete a yearlong counseling program.",

      "Potter, a 26-year-old winger who was born in England before moving to Australia as a child, was selected to play against Scotland in a test match taking place in Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh on Sunday.",
      "When he was picked by the Wallabies last month for their end-of-year European tour, the 26-year-old Potter said he had been given the nickname \u201cWizard\u201d by a teammate \u2014 in reference to the Harry Potter character in J.K.

      "Potter will become the 18th player to make his debut for Australia in 2024 \u2014 and the 989th player to feature for the Wallabies in their proud history \u2014 as coach Joe Schmidt continues to bring in new faces in search of greater squad depth.",
      "Potter is one of six changes to the team that started the 52-20 win over Wales last weekend, including captain Harry Wilson returning at No. 8 and Joseph Sua'ali'i \u2014 who switched from rugby league last month \u2014 is back at outside center for his second start for Australia.",
      "Sua'ali'i also started the 42-37 victory over England that kicked off the Wallabies' end-of-year European tour. It ends in Dublin with a test against Ireland, when Australia will be hoping to clinch a first Grand Slam since 1984.",

      "The microbudget movie \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into lo-fi legend",
      "NEW YORK -- The microbudget movie \"Hundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into lo-fi legend. Mike Cheslik\u2019s film, made for just $150,000 and self-distributed in theaters, has managed to gnaw its way into a movie culture largely dominated by big-budget sequels.",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a wordless black-and-white bonanza of slapstick antics about a stranded 19th century applejack salesman, played by his friend Ryland Tews, at war with a bevy of beavers, all of whom are played by actors in mascot costumes. It's played in at least one theater a week since opening in January. On Dec. 5, it will play in more theaters than any point before.",
      "It's no overnight sensation. It's been two years since Cheslik first premiered \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d",
      "Here's how it happened:",
      "Like all great ideas, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d started at a bar. In October 2018, Cheslik and Tews \u2014 friends since they were 15 growing up in Wisconsin \u2014 were talking over how they could expand from their last film, \u201cLake Michigan Monster,\u201d an antic, even lower budgeted B-movie about the hunt for a Great Lakes sea monster. It culminated in an elaborate animation sequence by Cheslik, a trial run for \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d",
      "For their next movie, Cheslik imagined something reminiscent of childhood, with snowball fights and sled chases. Oh, and mascot costumes. \u201cBecause mascots falling down is a universal language,\u201d Tews says. \u201cEveryone thinks that\u2019s funny.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love slapstick and I don\u2019t know why it was a dormant genre for so long,\u201d adds Cheslik. \u201cMy guess is that when a country shifts from having more physical jobs to more of a service economy then the sense of humor becomes more verbal. The alligator in a pit is an HR referral instead of getting hurt at your job.\u201d",
      "They made \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d over two winters during the pandemic, with pick-up shoots in between. It wasn\u2019t particularly fun work \u2014 they were outside in negative degree weather schlepping gear through the snow. But they were making exactly the movie they wanted, without compromise. And it didn\u2019t resemble anything at the multiplex.",
      "\u201cRyland and I complained about movies a lot during the making of \u2018Hundreds of Beavers,\u2019\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cI think we just complained for six years straight.\u201d",
      "Cheslik and Tews are not proponents of high-priced gear. Making a movie, they say, doesn\u2019t have be an 8K camera and a rented location.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not camera nerds,\u201d says Cheslik. \u201cWe just like images with strong shapes. We like to say: Shapes are free.\u201d",
      "In editing, Cheslik brought those shapes into greater relief. \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d plays out as a surreal ballet of chiaroscuro pratfalls, with cartoonish figures set against a white winter expanse. The beavers, themselves, never totaled more than six, with Tews, Cheslik or friends variously acting inside the costumes. Almost every shot in the movie required at least some effects work.",
      "\u201cWhat you can do is go on your computer and take those six and duplicate them. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 12 beavers. I\u2019m talkin\u2019, imagine a number, 18,\u201d deadpans Cheslik. \u201cIt\u2019s technical stuff.\u201d",
      "Once it was finally done, they excitedly hit the festival circuit. After debuting \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d at the Fantastic Fest, they played more festivals. And then some more. The crowd reaction was great and they won an audience award at the Fantasia Film Festival in 2023. But a decent offer never came. The old way of shopping a movie at a festival, they found, didn\u2019t really exist anymore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to make a movie,\u201d says Tews. \u201cThat\u2019s just the very beginning.\u201d",
      "Producer Kurt Ravenwood decided to explore a self release. They sold streaming rights to Cineverse, the company that recently distributed the indie horror hit \u201cTerrifier 3.\u201d But they kept theatrical, merchandising and Blu-ray rights.",
      "\u201cIt was a calculated risk to keep theatrical rights to ourselves,\u201d Ravenwood says. \u201cWe had never, ever in our lives put on a theatrical run. But we knew that if we were able to get it booked, it would do well.\u201d",
      "They hired a distribution veteran to help book theaters and a publicist to spread the word. And they crossed their fingers.",
      "\u201cWe believe that indie movies that go into the digital nothingness of streaming don\u2019t get into the culture,\u201d says Ravenwood. \u201cSo we kicked it off with this roadshow. At first, we needed to prove to theaters that people would show up. Besides just the movie, we\u2019d bring the circus to town.\u201d",
      "Calling it the \u201cGreat Lakes Roadshow,\u201d they rented out theaters and played \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d to mostly sold-out screenings in the Midwest. They didn\u2019t just play the movie, but created a vaudeville act to go along with it. The beaver mascot costumes came out of the closet.",
      "\u201cIf anything, this is what Instagram creators and TikTok creators are used to every day,\u201d says Ravenwood. \u201cThey both make the content and distribute the content via platform. If filmmakers want to reach an audience, they have to treat it like online creators treat it.\u201d",
      "Their quixotic gambit worked. People and media started taking notice. \u201cBeaver fever,\u201d as they say, took hold. None of it happened quickly, or easily. Ravenwood shipped a lot of posters and digital versions of the film. Cheslik and Tews spent two years just releasing their movie. Six years had passed since they had started. Making \u201cThe Revenant\u201d looked, comparatively, like a piece of cake. But they did it.",
      "\u201cIt was a life goal that was achieved,\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cWhich is just a horrible thing to have happen.\u201d",
      "They are already pondering their next movie; notecards hung on the wall behind Cheslik. For now, he\u2019s only saying that it will, like \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d feature precise physical comedy.",
      "The beaver suits? Cheslik imagines they must now be filled with black mold that after being torn and repaired countless times, going through two Wisconsin winters, dozens of festivals and some 20 roadshows.",
      "Next time, he and Tews hope is a little easier \u2014 a little easier to make a living from, and a little easier to find their way into theaters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love when people say, \u2018Our goal with this film just to get it out there. I don\u2019t care if I make money,\u2019\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cAre these films vanity projects for trust fund hobbyists, or is this an industry?\u201d"

      "Two of the new holiday movies coming to TV this season have a Taylor Swift connection that her fans would have no problem decoding",
      "Two new Christmas TV movies have a Taylor Swift connection that her fans would have no problem decoding.",
      "\u201cChristmas in the Spotlight\u201d debuts Saturday on Lifetime. It stars Jessica Lord as the world's biggest pop star and Laith Wallschleger as a pro football player, who meet and fall in love \u2014 not unlike Swift and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "\u201cIt's clearly inspired by Taylor and Travis, but I don\u2019t know them and I don\u2019t know what is going on behind the scenes. I only know what\u2019s been put out there,\u201d said Eirene Tran Donohue, a longtime, devoted fan who jumped at the opportunity to write a script even loosely based on her favorite musician.",
      "She was inspired by the couple's support of each other's accomplishments, particularly Kelce's ease with dating the star despite the glare of the spotlight, adding, \u201cI love the way that he celebrates her.\"",
      "Tran Donohue wants fellow Swift fans to know she wrote the script with them in mind.",
      "\u201cThere are so many Easter eggs,\" she said of little details added that a Swift fan would pick up on. \u201cI put in as many as I could.\u201d",
      "Then, on Nov. 30, Hallmark will air \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story.\" Instead of a nod to Swift, it's an ode to family traditions and bonding, like rooting for a sports team. Hallmark's headquarters is also in Kansas City, so it makes sense why the company chose the Chiefs to be highlighted.",
      "In this story, written by Julie Sherman Wolfe, sparks fly when a new employee for the Chiefs organization (Tyler Hynes) meets a woman \u2014 played by Hunter King \u2014 whose family's dedication to the team goes back generations.",
      "Sherman Wolfe, a San Francisco 49ers fan, said she got the call a week after Super Bowl LVIII, when the Chiefs beat the 49ers 25-22.",
      "\u201cI was still nursing my wounds,\u201d she said adding that Hallmark asked, \u2018Can you can you separate yourself from the loss and do this movie? I said, \u2019Absolutely. I mean, I\u2019m a professional,'\" Sherman Wolfe said, laughing.",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d has no mention of Swift or Kelce, it does feature a few Chiefs player cameos and Donna Kelce also has a small role.",
      "\u201cI kept botching my line,\u201d Hynes said of working with Mama Kelce. \u201cI was just like, Donna Kelce's about to speak and I\u2019m beside myself. It was so fun.\u201d",
      "The actors also got to film at Arrowhead Stadium and on the field.",
      "\u201cThose were just some of the coolest moments I\u2019ve ever gotten to have working on a movie,\u201d King said."

    "story": [
      "The low-budget movie \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into a lo-fi legend",
      "NEW YORK -- Hard as it may be to believe, changing the future of cinema was not on Mike Cheslik\u2019s mind when he was making \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d Cheslik was in the Northwoods of Wisconsin with a crew of four, sometimes six, standing in snow and making his friend, Ryland Tews, fall down funny.",
      "\u201cWhen we were shooting, I kept thinking: It would be so stupid if this got mythologized,\u201d says Cheslik.",
      "And yet, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has accrued the stuff of, if not quite myth, then certainly lo-fi legend. Cheslik\u2019s film, made for just $150,000 and self-distributed in theaters, has managed to gnaw its way into a movie culture largely dominated by big-budget sequels.",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a wordless black-and-white bonanza of slapstick antics about a stranded 19th century applejack salesman (Tews) at war with a bevy of beavers, all of whom are played by actors in mascot costumes.",
      "No one would call \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d expensive looking, but it\u2019s far more inventive than much of what Hollywood produces. With some 1,500 effects shots Cheslik slaved over on his home computer, he crafted something like the human version of Donald Duck\u2019s snowball fight, and a low-budget heir to the waning tradition of Buster Keaton and \u201cNaked Gun.\u201d",
      "At a time when independent filmmaking is more challenged than ever, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has, maybe, suggested a new path forward, albeit a particularly beaver-festooned path.",
      "After no major distributor stepped forward, the filmmakers opted to launch the movie themselves, beginning with carnivalesque roadshow screenings. Since opening in January, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has played in at least one theater every week of the year, though never more than 33 at once. (Blockbusters typically play in around 4,000 locations.) More than half of its approximately $500,000 in ticket sales came after the movie went to video-on-demand.",
      "Daniel Scheinert, the co-director of the best picture-winning \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d recently called \u201cHundreds of \u201cBeavers\u201d \u201cthe future of cinema.\u201d That bold pronouncement, which ricocheted around film blogs, might seem extreme for a movie about a guy wearing a comically large beaver hat.",
      "But in a shrinking movie industry, DIY microbudget filmmaking may increasingly be left to fill some of the void left by risk-averse, corporate-driven Hollywood.",
      "\u201cI hope people can stop shooting things to make them look like commercials and just get back to more of the nitty gritty and letting your imagination flow,\u201d says Tews, who also co-wrote the movie with Cheslik. \u201cI just hope we stop bowing down to Hollywood and thinking they\u2019re the gold standard. Because they just aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The year-to-date box office in North America is down 11% from last year and about 25% from before the pandemic. More movies are making a tiny impact in theaters; according to Franchise Entertainment Research, 41 wide releases in 2024 have grossed less than $3 million \u2014 nearly three times the amount in 2019.",
      "The costs not just to make wide-release films but to market them has greatly shifted what even indie distributors are willing to back. Just to get eyeballs on \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which carries a $250 million budget, Paramount Pictures took the extraordinary step of running a trailer of the film simultaneously on more than 4,000 platforms, including TV networks, radio stations and digital outlets. For even the biggest movies, it\u2019s hard to get people\u2019s attention.",
      "In such an environment, where the expense of making and marketing a movie is potentially prohibitive for everything but the safest of bets, more filmmakers are questioning the economics. That\u2019s especially because after last year\u2019s strikes, movie production hasn\u2019t rebounded. In a contracting movie industry, many remain out of work.",
      "Brady Corbet, director of the highly touted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d a 3 \u00bd-hour epic shot in VistaVision, for less than $10 million, has preached that smaller budgets don\u2019t have to mean less artistic ambition. Sean Baker, whose breakthrough film \u201cTangerine\u201d was shot with iPhones, has argued movie budgets can come down without sacrificing what\u2019s on the screen. His $6 million \u201cAnora\u201d is one of the year\u2019s most acclaimed films.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s panic in LA,\u201d Baker said in an earlier interview. \u201cI\u2019m like: We don\u2019t have to make films for that much. They don\u2019t have to cost as much.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a more micro example, but it was likewise made with a strong belief in the big screen. On Dec. 5, the movie will begin an encore tour in theaters, at some 70 locations. That\u2019s the widest release yet for \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d nearly a year after it opened. They\u2019re calling it \u201cA Northwoods Christmas.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a victory tour (with a Blu-ray release to follow) for \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d a barnstorming indie hit that Cheslik hopes shows aspiring filmmakers that the same kind of goofy inventiveness that goes into a TikTok video can be channeled into a movie.",
      "\u201cYou still can do whatever you want,\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to stop you if you take a phone and make a 90-minute timeline instead of a 30-second timeline.\"",

      "A special tribunal has rejected a legal claim against Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency by more than 300 survivors of a bombing that killed 22 people at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert in Manchester",
      "LONDON -- A legal claim against Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency by more than 300 survivors of a bombing that killed 22 people at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert in Manchester was rejected Friday by a special tribunal.",
      "Judges on the U.K.\u2019s Investigatory Powers Tribunal said the claimants waited too long to bring their case, which alleged that MI5 violated their human rights by failing to take measures that could have prevented the disaster.",
      "Suicide bomber Salman Abedi set up a knapsack bomb in Manchester Arena at the end of Grande's concert on May 22, 2017, as thousands of young fans were leaving. As well as the 22 dead, more than 100 people were injured, many of them children and teenagers. Abedi died in the explosion.",
      "An official inquiry reported last year that MI5 didn\u2019t act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the U.K. in recent years.",
      "Abedi had been a \u201csubject of interest\u201d to MI5 officials in 2014, but his case was closed shortly after because he was deemed to be low risk.",
      "The report also found one MI5 officer considered intelligence about Abedi to be a possible national security concern, but didn\u2019t discuss it with colleagues quickly enough.",
      "Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said in a rare televised statement that he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d his agency was unable to prevent the attack.",
      "Justice Rabinder Singh said the tribunal was \u201cconscious of the horrendous impact of the atrocity\u201d on the victims but said it would not be fair to let the claims proceed when they could have been filed sooner.",
      "\u201cAny reasonable person would have sympathy for them,\" Singh said. \u201cThe grief and trauma which they have suffered, particularly where young children were killed, is almost unimaginable.\"",
      "Singh also noted that if the case had proceeded it would have taken MI5 away from its core mission.",
      "Three law firms representing the victims said in a statement that the ruling was \u201cextremely disappointing.\u201d",
      "\"Our clients have had to endure continued delays but have done so with great patience and understanding in the hope that by allowing all legal processes to be fully explored, transparency and justice would be achieved,\u201d the statement said."

      "As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade.",
      "The unveiling of the exhibition \u201cEye to Eye\u201d has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran's Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country's theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars.",
      "\u201cThe first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,\u201d said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum.",
      "\u201cIf such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it\u2019s enough. They are really precious.\u201d",
      "The government of Iran\u2019s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran\u2019s cultural standing on the world stage.",
      "But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum\u2019s vault. Some paintings \u2014 cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art \u2014 sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution.",
      "Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes.",
      "Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, \u201cJacqueline Kennedy II,\u201d is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that\u2019s why this show distinguishes itself from others,\u201d said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition's curator. \u201dA lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.\u201d",
      "The presence of Western art comes as Iran's government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a \u201csoft\u201d cultural war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country's politics or Shiite religion.",
      "Among the visitors were many women defying the country's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran's presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger.",
      "And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran's collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It\u2019s extremely exciting to see the works here,\u201d said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. \u201cI had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.\u201d",

      "Video obtained by TMZ shows Kelce explaining that he doesn\u2019t sign autographs for people that follow where he is going. After being shouted at for over two minutes, Kelce eventually got out of the car and signed autographs, including shaking the hand of a man who was berating Kelce with obscenities.",

      "Snoop Dogg and Simone Biles turned their Olympic bond from this summer\u2019s Paris Games into a new challenge: The superstar tandem will team up on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Snoop Dogg and Simone Biles turned their Olympic bond from this summer\u2019s Paris Games into a new challenge: The superstar tandem will team up on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice.\u201d",
      "Biles will join Snoop for an episode on the reality competition television series, airing Monday. As a coach on the show, the rap star enlisted Biles as a mentor in the playoff round to help advise five vocalists who are vying for a spot in the live shows.",
      "For Snoop and Biles, their pairing was a superb match for the sports and music icons \u2014 who carried their effortless chemistry from the Olympics to the TV set of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were able to riff off each other and give the artists the best insight going into the next round,\u201d Biles told The Associated Press in a recent interview with Snoop after both finished filming the episode in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty easy, simple,\u201d added Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all-time who won four medals \u2014 three of them gold \u2014 at the recent Olympics. \u201cWe\u2019re both very mellow. But if we need to bring that energy up, then we can. For us, it was about instilling confidence going into the next week.\u201d",
      "Biles might be famous for her athletic prowess, but she was able to relate to the music contestants \u2014 from one competitor to another.",
      "\u201cThese are the learning steps: Learn, process, go back in and work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all have the vocal talent. It\u2019s about harnessing that, knowing when to bring it out and which songs to sing and which genre you fit in. And what you want your legacy to be. This is truly a special show as well as the judging. They don\u2019t get to see the physical appearance first. It\u2019s all off of ears, listening and putting their craft together as well.\u201d",
      "Despite having different career paths, Snoop and Biles share a mutual respect for each other\u2019s ability to shine on the biggest stages.",
      "\u201cWe have such diverse careers. But the things that we dealt with, they\u2019re dealing with now,\u201d said Snoop, the ultra-smooth entertainer who took on a starring role as a special correspondent in NBC\u2019s record-breaking coverage. He\u2019s a coach on \u201cThe Voice\u201d along with Michael Bubl\u00e9, Reba McEntire and Gwen Stefani, with each attempting to discover and coach the next singing phenomenon.",
      "Snoop said they felt the need to instill wisdom and confidence in each participant.",
      "\u201cWe have the best experience and knowledge to give to these performers,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a performer. I\u2019m a performer. We\u2019ve performed under extreme conditions. We always do our best. But sometimes things happen behind closed doors that you don\u2019t know about. So, we\u2019re able to speak to those things and give them real reassurance.\u201d",
      "During the Olympics, Biles and Snoop had a few viral moments. Both caught up with each other to cheer on Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone during her 400-meter hurdles race; he gifted Biles\u2019 father, Ronald Biles, with a Death Row Records gold necklace for his 75th birthday; and he was spotted dancing in the crowd during the women's gymnastics qualifying round as Biles and her teammate Jordan Chiles joined in.",
      "While on set, Biles was often all smiles while watching Snoop in his charismatic element.",
      "\u201cI knew Snoop would stay true and authentic to himself here on \u2018The Voice.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t have to fit a mold. There\u2019s a space for everyone.\u201d",
      "Snoop said it made sense for both to work together on the episode.",
      "\u201cThis is family. It feels good,\u201d Snoop said. \u201c(Biles) can do anything she wants to do. She picks and chooses what she wants to do. We\u2019re at that point of our careers right now. It has to feel good. It can\u2019t be forced or I\u2019m not doing it. Period, point, blank.\u201d"

    "summary": "When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted",
    "story": [
      "When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted",
      "NEW YORK -- When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted.",
      "Cole, one of the most important chroniclers of apartheid-era South Africa, was by then mostly forgotten and penniless. Banned by his native country after the publication of his pioneering photography book \u201cHouse of Bondage,\u201d Cole had emigrated in 1966 to the United States. But his life in exile gradually disintegrated into intermittent homelessness. A six-paragraph obituary in The New York Times ran alongside a list of death notices.",
      "But Cole receives a vibrant and stirring resurrection in Raoul Peck\u2019s new film \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d narrated in Cole\u2019s own words and voiced by LaKeith Stanfield. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, is laced throughout with Cole\u2019s photographs, many of them not before seen publicly.",
      "As he did in his Oscar-nominated James Baldwin documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d the Haitian-born Peck shares screenwriting credit with his subject. \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is drawn from Cole\u2019s own writings. In words and images, Peck brings the tragic story of Cole to vivid life, reopening the lens through which Cole so perceptively saw injustice and humanity.",
      "\u201cFilm is a political tool for me,\u201d Peck said in a recent interview over lunch in Manhattan. \u201cMy job is to go to the widest audience possible and try to give them something to help them understand where they are, what they are doing, what role they are playing. It\u2019s about my fight today. I don\u2019t care about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is a movie layered with meaning that goes beyond Cole\u2019s work. It asks questions not just about the societies Cole documented but of how he was treated as an artist, drawing uncomfortable parallels between apartheid and post-Jim Crow America. In the U.S., Cole was given a Ford Foundation grant to capture Black life in rural and urban areas, but he struggled to find a foothold professionally. Some editors said his images lacked \u201cedge.\u201d",
      "In 2017, more than 60,000 of Cole\u2019s 35mm film negatives were discovered in a bank vault in Stockholm, Sweden. Much of that material, including thousands of photographs Cole took in the U.S., was believed lost. Answers for how they had gotten there, and why they hadn't been known about earlier were hard to come by. \u201cLost and Found\u201d portrays the struggle of Cole's estate to acquire the collection. Only on the eve of the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere in May did the bank finally announce the handover of most materials to the estate.",
      "What those photographs reveal is an artist who made much more than indelible images of apartheid life. Cole\u2019s early photographs, published in 1967, offered one of the most illustrative and damning portraits of apartheid to Western eyes, including a widely reproduced photograph of a middle-aged woman sitting on a park bench that read \u201cEuropean\u2019s only.\u201d But he was an equally astute and sensitive observer of the segregations, and multicultural joys, of American life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d Stanfield narrates as Cole. \u201cSteal every moment.\u201d",
      "For Peck, the themes of \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d are deeply personal. The 71-year-old filmmaker, a former minister of culture in Haiti, has spent much of his artistic life also away from his native country, in Berlin, Paris and New York. He dedicates the movie \u201cto those who died in exile.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I say that, that\u2019s most of my friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI recognize all the steps. When you take a contact sheet, I see myself.\u201d",
      "For some four decades, Peck has made some of the most urgent films, in both fiction (including 2000\u2019s \u201cLumumba,\u201d about the exiled Congo leader) and non-fiction (including last year\u2019s \u201cSilver Dollar Road\u201d ). But he has rarely not employed both narrative and documentary elements in films that take their own shape \u2014 movies less interested in genre distinctions than they are pursuing unexamined truths.",
      "That\u2019s made Peck an increasingly exceptional figure in a documentary world that\u2019s become more and more dominated by glossier, less probing films for streaming platforms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse. There\u2019s less money so young people are desperate and accept stuff that my generation would never accept,\u201d Peck says. \u201cThe whole industry has changed. I knew another world, and I recognize it\u2019s not that anymore.\u201d",
      "Peck is currently editing a documentary on George Orwell. Like \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d it will be told totally in Orwell\u2019s words. A few days after the U.S. election, Peck was working to update a moment in the film that touches on President-elect Donald Trump. Peck has been astonished at how prescient Orwell was on so many current issues \u2014 misinformation, AI, social media, the refugee crisis.",
      "\u201cHe was a really incredible critic of history and how history is even told,\u201d says Peck. \u201cBefore plunging into it, I did not realize how sharp he was about what\u2019s going on today.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me,\u201d he adds, \u201ca film has value if it\u2019s talking to us today.\u201d"

      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture. But, more than a year later, that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to make \u201cGlicked\u201d \u2014 or even \u201cBabyratu\u201d \u2014 happen.",
      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "The Illinois Supreme Court has overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lied to Chicago police",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lying to Chicago police, saying he should not have been charged a second time after reaching a deal with prosecutors.",
      "The ruling, which did not address Smollett's continued claims of innocence, was the latest twist in a yearslong saga. Smollett, who is Black and gay, made headlines around the world after he told police in January 2019 that two men assaulted him in his downtown Chicago neighborhood, spouting slurs, tossing a noose around his neck, and yelling that he was in \u201cMAGA country,\u201d an apparent reference to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d presidential campaign slogan. The report prompted a massive search for suspects by Chicago police before investigators announced that they believed the attack was a hoax.",
      "The state's highest court found that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after Smollett reached a deal with the Cook County state\u2019s attorney in which charges against him were dropped in exchange for him forfeiting his $10,000 bond and performing community service. The deal prompted outrage in part because it did not include any condition that Smollett apologize or admit he staged the attack.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,\u201d Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the court\u2019s 5-0 opinion. \u201cNevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.\u201d",
      "Smollett was on the television drama \u201cEmpire,\u201d which filmed in Chicago, and prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio\u2019s response to hate mail he received. Testimony at trial indicated he paid $3,500 to two men whom he knew from \u201cEmpire\u201d to carry it out. Smollett testified that \u201cthere was no hoax\u201d and that he was the victim of a hate crime.",
      "Smollett declined to comment Thursday through a publicist. His attorney, Nenye Uche, said Smollett was happy and relieved but also disappointed to have been \u201cdragged through an unfair process.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though this is over now and Jussie just absolutely wants to move his life forward, people should start asking questions. How did this happen? Why should this even happen? What can we do to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again?\u201d Uche said at a news conference in Chicago.",
      "The special prosecutor, former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb, said he disagreed with the court\u2019s ruling while noting that it \u201chas nothing to do with Mr. Smollett\u2019s innocence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct,\u201d Webb said.",
      "After Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx's office dropped the initial 16 counts of disorderly conduct, the backlash was swift, with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling it \u201ca whitewash of justice.\u201d Webb was appointed special prosecutor and a grand jury restored charges, leading to Smollett's 2021 conviction on five counts of disorderly conduct.",
      "Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail \u2014 six of which he served before he was freed pending appeal \u2014 and was ordered to pay about $130,000 in restitution. Chicago officials are pursuing reimbursement for that amount in police overtime through a civil case.",
      "Foxx told The Associated Press that she was not surprised that the high court found her handling of the case \u201cproper \u2014 if unpopular, proper.\u201d She criticized Webb's ensuing \u201clegal machinations,\u201d which she said ignored the tenet of prosecutorial discretion and landed the issue in the \u201csame position we were in in March 2019.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat they were doing in going to the court to re-prosecute someone because you didn\u2019t like the outcome would have set a horrendous precedent, in which anyone could come in and undermine the work of a prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d said Foxx, who did not seek a third term this year.",
      "Eileen O\u2019Neill Burke, the incoming Cook County state's attorney, declined to comment.",

    "summary": "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
    "story": [
      "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
      "Disabled people who use rideshare apps Lyft and Uber say their experience is not a seamless task of pressing a few buttons and being whisked to their destination minutes later.",
      "Instead, people who use wheelchairs and guide dogs have watched drivers cancel rides, charge cleaning fees for guide dogs or outright refuse to take them where they need to go.",
      "The rideshare companies plan to push app updates soon to address cancellations and misunderstandings, but advocates and disabled users say they want to see drivers be better educated about how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and want the companies to put in stricter discrimination policies. The new app features are just \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d said Lynn Dubinsky.",
      "\u201cThis option puts the burden back on the client rather than on the companies themselves to directly address (discrimination) with their drivers,\u201d said Dubinsky, who works for a guide-dog training school in San Rafael, California.",
      "Uber and Lyft have been the target of past federal lawsuits that allege they didn't follow ADA laws; Uber settled its suit in 2022 and Lyft settled a separate one in 2020. While rideshare apps aren't the only option for disabled people across the U.S. \u2014 public transit agencies must also have ADA-compliant buses and trains and offer paratransit options like shuttles \u2014 the disabled community relies on rideshare more than others, according to 2022 U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics.",
      "That's the case for Amber Sherrard, who is blind and has a guide dog named Della.",
      "The 32-year-old Denver resident has grown accustomed to drivers refusing to transport Della, whom she prefers to bring along instead of using a cane, which she says is less safe. Once, she ended up getting a ride from strangers at Denver's airport because a rideshare driver wouldn't allow Della in the car.",
      "Uber's app update will give users a way to identify as blind or deaf. Lyft will allow users to tell a driver they have a service animal \u2014 something that Uber launched as a small pilot program earlier this week in the U.S. and Canada. Both rideshare companies have hotlines for people to report drivers who refuse to allow them into their cars with a service animal.",
      "Sherrard said she's skeptical that the new app features will help, since she usually informs drivers about her guide dog and figured out how to add that she's visually impaired to her profile name to cut down on cancellations.",
      "\u201cJust like every other person in America working multiple jobs, trying to survive, I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d she said of drivers who've denied her rides. \u201cI have just as many bills as anyone else. I have just as many working hours as everyone else. I have just as many errands and things to do to survive as anyone else.\u201d",
      "Robert Silva has had issues with rideshare drivers because of his folding wheelchair, which he has used since losing his right leg in a car accident. The 34-year-old from Alameda, California, said he once tried ordering a rideshare five times in an hour and a half to go to Disneyland before a driver accepted his request.",
      "\u201cThey just see me in a wheelchair, first thing, and they\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s going to be a lot of baggage there,\u201d said Silva, who usually can get into a vehicle without assistance. \u201cI\u2019m sure when they see me they think it\u2019s going to be a lot more work than it actually is.\u201d",
      "Uber and Lyft said their disability policies include following the ADA and not denying rides to people solely because they have a guide dog. The companies also said new drivers are made aware of the policies during onboarding, and that established drivers get occasional reminders of disability policies. If drivers wrongfully decline to accommodate riders because of a service animal, they face a potential ban.",
      "Under the ADA, U.S. cities that have public transportation must provide paratransit at a comparable cost to the regular transit system.",
      "Cathy Johnston, 70, uses Atlanta's MARTA Mobility paratransit program so she doesn't have to leave her power wheelchair behind for a foldable wheelchair like she does when using Uber or Lyft. It's not as timely as rideshare; Johnston said she's had to wait up to 45 minutes \u2014 even after scheduling it at least 24 hours in advance.",
      "\u201cIt makes me mad because hey, I have things I have to do,\u201d she said.",
      "In recent years, 36 transportation programs in 15 states and Washington, D.C., have bolstered paratransit offerings with Uzurv, a rideshare company that specializes in door-to-door service for people with disabilities. The company says it immediately bans drivers who discriminate against disabled riders.",
      "Portland, Oregon, lost a third of its cab fleet because of a drop in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon after, TriMet, the city\u2019s public transit operation, signed a contract with Uzurv.",
      "It's been an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d solution that Eileen Collins Turvey, TriMet's director of accessibility programs, is satisfied with \u2014 so much so that she hopes to make it an on-demand service next year.",
      "But first, she wants to be able to expand all paratransit contractors\u2019 ability to serve wheelchair users.",
      "\u201cWe need to get beyond the floor of the ADA,\u201d she said.",

      "Extreme weather is making power outages longer and more frequent across the U.S. People with health conditions who depend on medical devices powered by electricity are particularly vulnerable",
      "HOUSTON -- Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.",
      "The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.",
      "\u201cIt was miserable,\u201d Rubit said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it.\u201d",
      "Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d caused roughly half a million outages.",
      "People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.",
      "At any given time, one in three households in the U.S. is \"actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to ERCOT, which manages most of the state's power grid.",
      "Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston\u2019s power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.",
      "CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: \u201cto build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.\u201d",
      "Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.",
      "The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. \u201cThere are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes in to that facility,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.",
      "Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can\u2019t disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius).",
      "In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.",
      "The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated that we didn\u2019t get the services that we needed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that we have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn\u2019t meant to be used for long periods.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything from CenterPoint,\" Burks said. \"We\u2019re always the last to get it.\u201d"

      "An officer at Vang Vieng's Tourism Police office, who refused to give his name, told The Associated Press on Friday that a \u201cnumber of people\u201d had been detained in the case but that no charges have yet been filed.

      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",

      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",

      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",

      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",

      "Even less than that is reaching the territory\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians because of the many obstacles to distribution, aid groups and the U.N. say \u2013 including restrictions on movement by the Israeli military, ongoing fighting, damage to roads, and theft. Armed men robbed nearly 100 aid trucks last weekend in southern Gaza, close to Israeli military positions. Israel blamed Hamas but appears to have taken no action to stop the looting, while Hamas said it was the work of local bandits.",
      "For months, Yasmin and her family have gone to bed hungry.",
      "\u201cEverything has increased in price, and we cannot buy anything,\" she said. \u201cWe always go to sleep without having dinner.\u201d",
      "She misses coffee, but a single packet of Nescafe goes for around $1.30. A kilogram (2 pounds) of onions goes for $10, a medium bottle of cooking oil for $15 \u2014 if available. Meat and chicken all but vanished from the markets months ago, but there are still some local vegetables. Such sums are astronomical in an impoverished territory where few people earn regular incomes.",
      "Crowds of hundreds wait hours to get food from charities, which are also struggling.",
      "Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his teams can offer only small bowls of rice or pasta once a day. He said they \u201ccan go to the market on one day and buy something for $5, and then go back in the afternoon to find it doubled or tripled in price.\u201d",
      "Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day.",
      "Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing.",
      "But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war.",
      "Israel blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving the aid, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border. The U.N. says it often cannot reach the border to pick up aid cargos because the Israeli military denies requests for movement and because of ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. As a result, it says, only about half the incoming aid is distributed.",
      "The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead, and Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza. But after the 30-day ultimatum expired, the Biden administration declined to take any action, saying there had been some progress.",
      "Israel, meanwhile, passed legislation severing ties with UNRWA. Israel accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas \u2014 allegations denied by the U.N.",
      "Israeli news outlets have reported that officials are considering plans for the military to take over aid distribution or contract it out to private security companies. Asked about such plans Wednesday, government spokesman David Mercer said \u201cIsrael is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.\u201d",
      "Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister who was seen as a voice of moderation in the far-right government before being fired this month, warned on X that handing over aid distribution to a private firm was a \u201ceuphemism for the beginning of military rule.\u201d",
      "As that debate plays out in Jerusalem, less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from central Gaza, most Palestinians in the territory are focused on staying alive in a war with no end in sight.",
      "\u201cI find it difficult to talk about the suffering we are experiencing. I am ashamed to talk about it,\u201d said Yasmin\u2019s husband, Hani. \u201cWhat can I tell you? I\u2019m a person who has 21 family members and is unable to provide them with a bag of flour.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.",
      "But four years later, voters in a growing list of its cities have banned the substance.",
      "Four cities, spanning Portland suburbs and rural and coastal towns, added new voter-approved prohibitions for the federally illegal compound in the Nov. 5 election. A dozen other communities that approved two-year moratoriums in 2022, when a majority of Oregon counties and over 100 cities voted to temporarily or permanently ban psilocybin, voted in this election to make the restrictions permanent.",
      "In the wake of the fentanyl crisis, the rejection of drug liberalization measures in Oregon and states across the country this election has some experts questioning whether voters are rethinking their appetite for such policies.",
      "In Massachusetts, for example, voters rejected a measure that would have allowed residents over 21 to grow and use plant-based psychedelic drugs in certain circumstances. All three states that had measures to legalize recreational marijuana voted against it.",
      "Oregon voters, in particular, appear to have soured on drug reform. A law passed by voters four years ago that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including heroin and methamphetamine, was rolled back by the state legislature earlier this year after heated debate over whether it played a role in a spike in public drug use and deaths.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the fact that the drug policy reform pendulum appears to be swinging back towards prohibition is part of a broader trend toward a preference for \u2018law and order\u2019 among American voters,\" said Josh Hardman, founder of Psychedelics Alpha, a consulting firm and newsletter on psychedelic research, business and policy. \u201cOregon, specifically, has been touted as an example of liberal drug policies gone wrong.\"",
      "Despite the local bans, psilocybin remains accessible in over 30 licensed centers spanning the state\u2019s most populous cities, like Portland, and a handful of small towns. Some rural counties also have voted to stay in the program.",
      "However, access to therapeutic psilocybin is further complicated by high costs: One session can be up to $2,000 out of pocket. That is largely because center owners and facilitators have to pass on licensure expenses to consumers in order to stay afloat.",
      "MJ Wilt, who just opened a licensed center in the Portland suburb of Gresham, spent tens of thousands of dollars of her own savings to get licensed and establish her center. It has been hard, she said, because her own experience with psilocybin changed her life for the better and she wants to bring that experience to others.",
      "\u201cThe cost for the program has been astronomical and is not accessible to people across the socioeconomic spectrum,\u201d Wilt said. \u201cIt's certainly not the cash cow that people think or thought it was going to be.\u201d",
      "In 2020, roughly 56% of Oregon voters approved Measure 109, which allowed for the manufacture and controlled, therapeutic use of psilocybin at licensed facilities for those over 21. But the measure allowed counties and cities to vote to opt out, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the state.",
      "Adding to the complexity, some cities have voted to allow psilocybin despite being in counties that banned it, as cities control the land incorporated within their borders while counties control unincorporated land.",
      "The regulatory patchwork resembles that of cannabis law. In half of the 24 states that have legalized recreational cannabis, including Oregon, localities may opt out of most types of cannabis businesses, according to Kate Bryan, a policy specialist on criminal and civil justice at the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Colorado in 2022 became the only other state to legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use. It will begin accepting license applications for \u201chealing centers\u201d at the end of December, a spokesperson for the state's natural medicine division said in an email. The law allows localities to adopt certain regulations regarding how the centers operate, but it does not allow them to ban such centers entirely.",
      "Multiple cities across the country also have voted to decriminalize psilocybin, meaning a person cannot be arrested or prosecuted for possessing limited amounts of plant-based hallucinogens.",
      "Psilocybin, found in several species of mushrooms, can cause hours of vivid hallucinations. Indigenous people have used it in healing rituals, and scientists are exploring whether it can help treat depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Researchers and military veterans are among those who have advocated for the study of the substance for therapeutic use.",
      "Kat Thompson, the founder and CEO of Fractal Soul, a licensed psilocybin center in the Portland suburb of Beaverton, said her center has served 400 people in its first year and that the \u201cvast majority\u201d have had positive outcomes. Many come seeking help for depression, anxiety, trauma and addiction after years of trying talk therapy and medication, she said, while others come to process grief or explore their spirituality.",
      "But she said a lack of public awareness about the state's psilocybin program has led many to confuse it with Measure 110, the separate ballot measure also passed in 2020 that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs. The botched implementation of the law \u2014 also a first of its kind in the nation \u2014 and rising overdose deaths amid the fentanyl crisis fueled pushback that prompted state lawmakers to backtrack on it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe actually got lots of calls from people who had booked sessions with us who heard about the roll back of 110 and thought that that meant that we were closing,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to explain and educate the public that Measure 110 was really just about decriminalization for personal use. It has nothing to do with the professional therapeutic model.\u201d",
      "Some people also confuse the model of the psilocybin center with cannabis dispensaries. At dispensaries, people buy cannabis and leave to consume it elsewhere. People who want to use psilocybin, meanwhile, must consume it at a licensed service center under the supervision of a licensed facilitator who administers it to them and remains with them for the duration of the trip, Thompson said.",
      "\u201cThis is essentially a mental health clinic where someone is here all day with us,\u201d she said. \"By and large, it is extremely safe.\u201d",
      "Of the over 16,000 doses that have been administered since the first licensed center opened in June 2023, staff at such centers have called 911 or taken a patient to a hospital five times, an Oregon Health Authority spokesperson said in an email, confirming reporting from The Oregonian/OregonLive. There are roughly 350 licensed facilitators and a dozen psilocybin manufacturers in the state, according to the agency's most recent figures.",
      "Joe Buck, the mayor of Lake Oswego, a Portland suburb that just passed a psilocybin ban, said he wasn't surprised by the outcome, even though a majority of the city's residents supported Measure 109 in 2020.",
      "\u201cOregon really has not done a great job managing its drug policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can understand how some people may be wary of the promises that are now being made around psilocybin.\u201d",
      "But further research on psilocybin, he said, could change voters' perspective in the future.",
      "\u201cIt really is up to state leaders, leaders in the federal government, to work these drugs through a good system that builds community trust.\""

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:02:21 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Less is known about Trump's pick for the Atlanta-based CDC, which develops vaccines and monitors for infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "Weldon is a staunch, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican. Legislation he introduced more than 20 years ago outlawed human cloning. He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",
      "Weldon's nomination is likely to placate some anti-abortion advocates, who have been concerned about Trump's nomination of Kennedy, a longtime Democrat and proponent of abortion rights, as the nation's top health official.",
      "Weldon retired from his congressional seat in 2008, after 14 years in public office. Earlier this year, he lost in a GOP primary for a seat in the Florida Legislature.",
      "If he's confirmed, he'll be in charge of more than 13,000 employees and nearly 13,000 other contract workers.",
      "Nesheiwat, meanwhile, will oversee 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members if the Republican-controlled Senate approves her nomination as the surgeon general. She is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York. She appears regularly on Fox News and has expressed frequent support for Trump, sharing photos of them together on her social media pages.",
      "Surgeons general also have the power to issue advisories, warning of public health threats in the U.S. Those advisories can influence how the government, public and medical community respond to health crises in the country.",

      "Two Australian teenagers and a British woman have died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos",
      "BANGKOK -- Two Australian teenagers and a British woman died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. An American man and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander also has been sickened. The U.S. State Department issued a warning to travelers to be \u201calert to the potential risk of methanol poisoning.\u201d But what is methanol, and how do you avoid it?",
      "There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol and isopropyl. Ethanol is what is found in consumer spirits and is the only one intended for consumption. Isopropanol is the main ingredient in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Methanol, commonly called wood alcohol because it is the byproduct of wood distillation, is frequently used as fuel and in products such as antifreeze and solvents.",
      "According to the Methanol Institute, the global trade association for the industry, drinking just 25 to 90 ml (0.7 to 3.0 ounces) of methanol can be fatal without proper medical treatment, but can be successfully treated if caught early.",
      "Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness and decreased consciousness including coma, seizure, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and multiple other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention immediately if methanol poisoning is suspected.",
      "\u201cIndividuals vary in their response to methanol,\u201d said toxicologist Alastair Hay from Britain\u2019s University of Leeds. \u201cSome will be able to tolerate more than others because we all have variability in the capacity of our enzymes to detox. But small quantities ... might be fatal for individuals; others may survive slightly more.\u201d",
      "Methanol is sometimes added deliberately by unscrupulous bars to mixed drinks to give them more \u201ckick\u201d and to save money on using higher-priced ethanol-based spirits such as vodka or rum. This practice is not specific to Laos or Southeast Asia, but occurs wherever taxes on legitimate alcohol or the cost of legitimate alcohol is perceived as being too high, according to the Methanol Institute.",
      "Methanol is also a normal product of the distillation process that produces ethanol, and in home-brew distilleries without strict controls \u2014 often found in poorer countries \u2014 it can end up in the mix.",
      "The answer is easy: don't drink it.",
      "But it's colorless, odorless and tasteless, so that can be something of a challenge.",
      "In guidance issued after the Laos poisonings, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office recommends only purchasing alcoholic beverages from licensed liquor stores, buying drinks only from licensed bars and hotels, always checking if bottle seals are intact, and checking labels for poor print quality or incorrect spellings.",
      "The Methanol Institute notes that beverages such as canned beer, cider, wine, pre-mix, and duty-free products tend to be safer and less easy to adulterate.",
      "It also urges people to be wary of homemade brews, and free drinks or drinks priced far below normal.",

She escaped the heat to train in the United Kingdom, but worries about a day when a warming world kills her sport entirely.",
      "American discus thrower Sam Mattis described temperatures as high as 44 Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) at the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, causing some fans, officials and athletes to pass out. And New Zealand soccer player Katie Rood recalled training in heat chambers to prepare for the Tokyo Olympics, and warmups cut short in high heat and humidity.",
      "All three spoke at the United Nations climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan to talk about the threat that climate change poses to them, to fans and to sport itself. With billions of fans worldwide, they're among athletes and leagues trying to get more people to care, and act, on climate change.",
      "\u201cIn the future, if climate change is not addressed and is not thoughtfully handled, triathlons can cease to exist,\u201d Mohan said at a panel discussion.",
      "It's not all about heat. Mohan noted this year's Paris Olympics had to delay some triathlon events because heavy rains \u2014 which have increased as a warming atmosphere holds more water \u2014 contributed to high bacteria levels in the Seine River.",
      "Some top soccer clubs have gotten together in a climate action alliance aimed at reducing emissions and inspiring fans to act on climate change. One of those is La Liga club Real Betis. Rafael Muela Pastor, general manager of the club's foundation, said at another panel in Baku that soccer is \u201cthe most powerful and massive sport in the world\u201d and it's crucial that \u201cwe have to do something.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a super power and we have a responsibility with that,\u201d he said.",
      "Leslie Mabon, a lecturer on environmental systems at the United Kingdom's Open University, said athletes can raise awareness on issues like global warming, but the most transformative activism often comes from elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think athletes can move the needle, but sometimes it\u2019s away from the very highest levels,\u201d said Mabon. \u201cThe financial implications of what\u2019s at stake do make it very difficult, and particularly the governing bodies \u2014 the leagues, the FIFAs of this world \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to get them to take action.\u201d",
      "FIFA \u2014 the governing body for world soccer \u2014 was unmoved by concerns about heat and human rights in holding the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a country criticized for its treatment of migrant workers, among other issues. And at times, outwardly positive actions from sports leaders can be little more than greenwashing.",
      "FIFA President Gianni Infantino attended COP29 and posted on Instagram about extending a partnership with Pacific Island nations to foster \u201cclimate-resilient football development\u201d and raise awareness about climate change. That came just months after FIFA signed a sponsorship deal with Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco.",
      "Women soccer players from around the world signed an open letter urging FIFA to end the deal, citing both the country's record on the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people and the impact of fossil fuel production on climate change.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for anything that comes from the top levels to be taken seriously or to be taken credibly when you still have these kind of deals in place,\u201d Mabon said.",
      "Climate change is also making sports more expensive and widening disparities. Jessica Murfree, assistant professor of sport administration at the University of North Carolina, said athletes will have to travel farther and spend more to train and compete as some places become incompatible with sport because it's too hot or there isn't enough snow.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to have a massive impact on athletes and athlete hopefuls,\u201d she said. \u201cIt drives a bigger socioeconomic wedge between the haves and the have-nots, which then becomes a justice issue.\u201d",
      "Sports are seeking to adapt to a hotter planet. Sometimes competitions get moved to different places, or starting times get shifted to cooler parts of the day. Then there's technology: Qatar spent billions to air-condition stadiums at its World Cup to keep fans and players cool.",
      "But sports can't air-condition its way out of the climate crisis, said Rood, the New Zealand soccer player.",
      "The energy it requires \u201cis a huge cost to the environment,\" she said in an interview, adding: \"It\u2019s not just the isolated events that happen once or twice a year. It\u2019s the training and the lead-up ... those conditions can\u2019t necessarily be created every time.\u201d",

      "A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison.",
      "Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government.",
      "Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest.",
      "The prosecution alleged King was a protest leader who was instrumental to the disruption in Ottawa. The prosecution alleged King coordinated the repeated bouts of honking, ordering the protesters to lay on the horn every 30 minutes for 10 minutes at a time, and told people to \u201chold the line\u201d when he was aware that police and the city had asked the truckers to leave.",
      "The prosecution's case relied mainly on King\u2019s own videos, which he posted to social media throughout the protest to document the demonstration and communicate with those taking part.",
      "King\u2019s lawyers argued that he was peacefully protesting and was not one of the demonstration's leaders.",
      "King was found not guilty on three counts of intimidation and one count of obstructing police himself.",
      "The truckers' convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant the honking of horns and music from parties.",
      "Trudeau's government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada.",
      "The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.",
      "The Freedom Convoy shook Canada\u2019s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was blocked. It carries more than 25% of trade between the countries, who are each other's largest trading partners."

      "A California infant has died and at least 10 other people have been sickened in an outbreak of listeria food poisoning tied to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products that include chicken feet, duck neck, beef shank and pork hock, federal health officials reported Friday.",
      "Yu Shang Food, Inc., of Spartanburg, South Carolina, has recalled more than 72,000 pounds of meat and poultry products tied to the outbreak, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Some products were initially recalled on Nov. 9.",
      "The foods were shipped to retail locations nationwide and available online, and illnesses have been reported in four states. The problem was discovered in October after routine tests detected listeria in the foods and the production environment.",
      "Of the 11 people sickened, nine have been hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said. Interviews with people who were sickened and laboratory findings pointed to the Yu Shang Food products.",
      "Although the foods have been recalled, some may still be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers. The products should be discarded or returned to the place of purchase. Refrigerators, containers and other surfaces that may have touched the foods should be cleaned and sanitized.",
      "People get sick with listeria poisoning when they eat foods contaminated with the bacteria. Symptoms can be mild and include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. More serious illness can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Listeria poisoning is tricky, because symptoms can start quickly, within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. But they also can take weeks or up to three months to show up. Those most vulnerable to getting sick include the very young, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.",
      "A different listeria outbreak tied to recalled Boar\u2019s Head deli meats has ended, CDC officials said this week. That outbreak killed 10 people this summer and sickened dozens of others.",

      "A Georgia official disbanded the state's maternal mortality committee that investigates deaths of pregnant women",
      "Georgia's top health official dismissed all members of a state committee that investigates pregnancy-related maternal deaths after a committee member presumably released information about two such deaths.",
      "In a letter first reported by ProPublica and dated Nov. 8, state public health commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said whoever shared the information violated state law and a confidential agreement signed by committee members. An agency investigation wasn't able to identify who disclosed the details.",
      "ProPublica reported in September that internal reports showed the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review Committee determined the deaths of two women were preventable, but found that doctors were hesitant to perform a procedure that could have saved their lives because of the state's strict abortion policies.",
      "The cases drew national attention and became a central theme in Vice President Kamala Harris ' presidential campaign. Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision more than two years ago that overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "The Georgia committee works to identify what caused women to die during pregnancy or soon after childbirth, seeking to prevent other deaths or health crises.",
      "The decision to disband the committee seems \u201cvery abrupt,\u201d said Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, one of the groups that sued Georgia over the state's abortion ban beyond six weeks of pregnancy. A judge initially struck down the ban, but Georgia's Supreme Court halted the ruling in October, restoring the law.",
      "\"To have any time where we don\u2019t have this committee in place difficult to fathom, realizing that we may lose access to really important data and information that could help us make better decisions and organize better around what we need for the state,\" Simpson said.",
      "Toomey wrote that reconstituting the committee \u201cwill not result in a delay\u201d of the committee's responsibilities.",
      "The Georgia Department of Public Health will open applications for new members in the \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d Toomey said in the letter, but will work to make sure there is more oversight and confidentiality in its review of cases.",
      "\"This is a scare tactic meant to stop full investigations into the circumstances of pregnant women\u2019s deaths across the state,\" Alicia Stallworth, Director of Georgia Campaigns at Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. \"Now more than ever, it\u2019s important to mobilize against anti-abortion extremists like Governor Kemp, who are responsible for these deadly bans.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp doesn't appoint or release members of the committee because it's overseen by the Department of Public Health, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said. Kemp signed into law in 2019 a ban on abortions once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.",
      "A spokesperson for the health department declined to provide additional comment and said the letter \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t regained all the loss we suffered,\u201d said Siraha, the organization\u2019s director.",
      "\u201cYou need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,\u201d she said.",
      "Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated.",
      "Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said.",
      "MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,\u201d Chinogwenya said.",
      "However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but \u201cto quiet their guidelines on access to abortion\u201d to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island.",
      "In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO.",
      "\u201cOrganizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,\u201d read part of the 2019 assessment report. \u201cUltimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.\u201d",
      "The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe\u2019s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities.",
      "Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women\u2019s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years.",
      "Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we want is the freedom to space our births.\u201d"

Period. I am not equivocating, and I have not equivocated about that. The way to solve this is through legislation.\"",
      "A bill to end casino smoking has been stalled in the state Legislature for years without the state's Democratic leadership allowing it to progress to full votes in the Senate and Assembly.",

      "The Atlantic City casino industry opposes a ban, fearing the loss of significant revenue and jobs if smokers stop coming to Atlantic City and take their business elsewhere.",
      "But opponents say casinos in several parts of the country have successfully gone smoke-free without losing business.",
      "A competing bill that would keep the current 25% limit of the casino floor on which smoking can occur, but impose other limits is also bottled up in the Legislature.",
      "That measure would allow smoking in unenclosed areas of the casino floor that contain slot machines and are designated as smoking areas that are more than 15 feet (4.6 meters) away from table games staffed by live dealers. It also would allow the casinos to offer smoking in enclosed, separately ventilated smoking rooms with the proviso that no worker can be assigned to work in such a room against their will.",
      "Ricky Foster, a supervisor-dealer at the Borgata for 21 years, said the frustration among workers is palpable.",
      "\u201cWe're tired of doing Go Fund Me accounts for people's cancer and heart conditions, and they never smoked a day in their life,\u201d he said.",

      "Insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans are dangling coverage with $0 premiums, and individual insurance marketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act offer tax credits to help with the premium or cost of coverage.",
      "Here are other factors to consider beyond price.",

      "Deductibles are different from copayments or copays. Those are flat amounts that a patient pays for a covered service or doctor visit. Copays typically do not count toward paying off a deductible.",
      "Insurers form networks of covered doctors and health systems. Some plans may provide no coverage for care sought outside those networks.",

    "summary": "Germany&rsquo;s popular defense minister has taken himself out of contention to become the country&rsquo;s next leader",
    "story": [
      "Germany\u2019s popular defense minister has taken himself out of contention to become the country\u2019s next leader",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's popular defense minister has taken himself out of contention to become the country's next leader, clearing the way for Chancellor Olaf Scholz to seek a second term in an early election after a week of arguments that exposed deep divisions in his struggling party.",
      "Scholz and leaders of his center-left Social Democrats vowed Friday to fight their way back from a wide poll deficit ahead of the election, expected to take place Feb. 23. They insisted that the chancellor's three years in power have brought successes and that the Social Democrats weren't responsible for the infighting that pushed his unpopular three-party coalition government to collapse this month.",
      "But a week of very public arguments about who should lead the fightback is widely viewed as having damaged the party further.",
      "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a video Thursday night that he has informed the party leadership he is \u201cnot available for a candidacy for the office of chancellor.\u201d He said that \u201cOlaf Scholz is a strong chancellor and he is the right candidate for chancellor.\u201d",
      "Rather than building momentum from Scholz's firing of his finance minister two weeks ago, which brought down the coalition, party members spent days airing public doubts about the chancellor.",
      "The Social Democrats' rivals already determined who will lead their campaigns. The main opposition center-right Union bloc, which leads in polls, nominated Friedrich Merz as its challenger in September. Scholz\u2019s remaining coalition partners, the Greens, named Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck to head their challenge on Sunday.",
      "While Scholz has made clear for months that he intends to run for a second term and his party's leadership had made clear that it backed him, the lack of a formal nomination created space for persistent speculation that the party might instead choose Pistorius, who enjoys much higher popularity.",
      "On Monday, two influential lawmakers said Scholz\u2019s \u201ccurrent standing is strongly linked\" with the failed coalition, which collapsed in a dispute about how to revive Germany\u2019s stagnant economy, and that they were hearing many compliments for Pistorius. Others weighed in for and against the chancellor, who was at the Group of 20 summit in Brazil as the debate swirled.",
      "Pistorius repeatedly said he stands behind Scholz and gave no indication that he planned to run for chancellor, but also conspicuously didn't rule it out until Thursday. The discussion, he said in the video released by the Social Democrats' leadership, was damaging to the party.",
      "\u201cI did not initiate this discussion, I did not want it and I did not bring myself into discussion for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now have a joint responsibility to end this debate.\u201d",
      "The party leadership is expected to formally nominate Scholz as its candidate for chancellor on Monday.",
      "\u201cI know these have been hard days,\u201d party co-leader Lars Klingbeil said Friday at a conference of local Social Democratic politicians in Berlin. \u201cBut if a party can fight, then it is the Social Democrats ... I want to win with you.\u201d",

      "Among those, he pointed to Germany's status as Ukraine's biggest military supplier in Europe, along with his often-criticized refusal to supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles over concerns of escalating the war with Russia. \u201cOnly with the Social Democrats will prudence come together with clear support for Ukraine,\u201d he said.",
      "The question of how to reinvigorate Germany's economy is likely to be central to the election campaign.",

      "A top South Korean official says Russia has supplied air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for Pyongyang sending troops",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Russia has supplied air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops to support Russia's war efforts against Ukraine, a top South Korean official said Friday.",
      "The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia in October, some of whom have recently begun engaging in combat on the front lines. North Korea's troop deployment threatens to escalate the war, and what Russia could give to the North in return has been a source of rampant international speculation.",
      "The most alarming development for South Korea and the U.S. would be Russia transferring sophisticated weapons technology that can enhance North Korea's nuclear-capable missiles targeting its rivals. Many experts say, though, that it is unlikely Russia would do this in the initial stage of the North\u2019s troop deployment.",
      "Shin Wonsik, national security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, told an SBS TV program Friday that South Korea has found Russia provided missiles and other equipment to help it reinforce its air defense network for Pyongyang, the capital. Shin didn\u2019t say what specific missiles Russia gave to North Korea.",
      "Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said that Russia has likely sent S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles, launchers and ground-based radar systems. He said that North Korea is capable of building shorter-range surface-to-air missiles on its own.",
      "The S-400 missile, with a range of 400 kilometers (250 miles), is considered one of Russia\u2019s most advanced anti-aircraft weapons. But Lee questioned how significantly it can boost Pyongyang\u2019s air defense, saying Russian air defense systems have failed to effectively deal with Ukrainian drone assaults.",
      "Many observers say North Korea has likely felt the urgent need to boost its air defense capabilities after it last month accused South Korea of flying drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang. North Korea threatened to take military action if leaflets were again dropped. South Korea\u2019s military has refused to confirm whether or not it was behind the alleged drone flights.",
      "Kim Dae Young, a military expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said it\u2019s possible that the air defense systems North Korea acquired from Russia could include counter-drone equipment.",
      "Kim said that Pyongyang's outdated air defense system would need years of improvement and potentially huge external help to cope with the superior air forces of South Korea and the United States.",
      "Shin said Russia has also appeared to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North's efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system. Shin didn\u2019t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea.",
      "During a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin already said that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites. North Korea put its first spy satellite into orbit in November last year, but foreign experts question whether that satellite can produce militarily meaningful imagery. The North's attempt to launch a second spy satellite failed in May.",
      "North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their military and other cooperation in the face of separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies. Last month, South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. The National Intelligence Service said Wednesday that North Korea had recently sent additional artillery systems to Russia.",
      "Earlier this week, North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation following high-level talks in Pyongyang this week, according to the countries\u2019 state-run media."

    "story": [
      "Japan will hold a memorial ceremony near the Sado Island Gold Mines, which were listed this summer as a UNESCO World Heritage site after the country moved past years of disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the dark side of their history",
      "SADO, Japan -- Japan will hold a memorial ceremony on Sunday near the Sado Island Gold Mines, which were listed this summer as a UNESCO World Heritage site after the country moved past years of historical disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the mines' dark history.",
      "At these mines, hundreds of Koreans were forced to labor under abusive and brutal conditions during World War II, historians say. The Japanese government said Sunday\u2019s ceremony will pay tribute to \u201call workers\u201d who died at the mines, but without spelling out who they are \u2014 part of what critics call a persistent policy of whitewashing Japan's history of sexual and labor exploitation before and during the war.",
      "The ceremony, which was supposed to further mend their wounds, renewed tensions between the two sides. On Saturday, South Korea's government said it will boycott the memorial service due to unspecified disagreements with Tokyo over the event.",
      "There was no immediate response from Japanese officials.",
      "Ahead of the ceremony on Sunday, The Associated Press explains the Sado mines, their history and the controversy.",
      "The 16th century mines on the island of Sado, about the size of the Pacific island of Guam, off the western coast of Niigata prefecture, operated for nearly 400 years beginning in 1601 and were once the world\u2019s largest gold producer. They closed in 1989. During the Edo period, from 1600 to 1868, the mines supplied gold currency to the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate.",
      "Today, the site has been developed as a tourist facility and hiking site where visitors can learn about the changes in mining technology and production methods while looking at the remains of mine shafts and ore dressing facilities.",
      "Critics say the Japanese government only highlights the glory of the mines and covers up its use of Korean victims of forced labor and their ordeals. The mines were registered as a cultural heritage site in July after Japan agreed to include an exhibit on the conditions of Korean forced laborers and to hold a memorial service after repeated protests from the South Korean government.",
      "At the July meeting of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the Japanese delegate said Tokyo had installed new exhibition material to explain the \u201csevere conditions of (the Korean laborers\u2019) work and to remember their hardship.\u201d",
      "Japan also acknowledged that Koreans were made to do more dangerous tasks in the mine shaft, which caused some to die. Those who survived also developed lung diseases and other health problems. Many of them were given meager food rations and nearly no days off and were caught by police if they escaped, historians say. But the Japanese government has refused to admit they were \u201cforced labor.\u201d",
      "South Korea had earlier opposed the listing of the site for UNESCO World Heritage on the grounds that the Korean forced laborers used at the mines were missing from the exhibition. South Korea eventually supported the listing after consultations with Japan and Tokyo\u2019s pledge to improve the historical background in the exhibit and to hold a memorial that also includes Koreans.",
      "Historians say Japan used hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific. About 1,500 Koreans were forced to work at the Sado mines, according to Yasuto Takeuchi, an expert on Japan\u2019s wartime history, citing wartime Japanese documents.",
      "The South Korean government has said it expects Japan to keep its pledge to be truthful to history and to show both sides of the Sado mines.",
      "\u201cThe controversy surrounding the Sado mines exhibit underscores a deeper problem\u201d of Japan\u2019s failure to face up to its wartime responsibility and its growing \u201cdenialism\u201d of its wartime atrocities, Takeuchi said.",
      "All workers who died at the Sado mines will be honored. That includes hundreds of Korean laborers who worked there during Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.",
      "Officials say the ceremony is organized by a group of local Japanese politicians, business owners and other volunteers who campaigned for the Sado mines to win the UNESCO status, but preparations were handled by local government officials, who did not disclose details, including guests and programs, until the last minute.",
      "Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya announced the ceremony on Friday, but he declined to comment on \u201cdiplomatic exchanges.\u201d",
      "Officials at Sado city and the Foreign Ministry said about 100 people, including officials from Japan\u2019s local and central government, as well as South Korean Foreign Ministry officials and the relatives of Korean wartime laborers, have been invited. Attendants are expected to observe a moment of silence for the victims who died at the mines due to accidents and other causes.",
      "The ceremony dredged up long-standing frustrations in South Korea, where the Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was impossible to settle the disagreements between both governments before the planned event on Sunday, without specifying what those disagreements were.",
      "The cancelation came a day after Japan said it will send a parliamentary vice minister, Akiko Ikuina, who in 2022 visited Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's 2.5 million war dead including convicted war criminals and is seen by Japan's neighbors as a symbol of its wartime militarism.",
      "Some South Koreans had criticized the Seoul government throwing its support behind an event without securing a clear Japanese commitment to highlight the plight of Korean laborers. There were also complaints over South Korea agreeing to pay for the travel expenses of Korean victims\u2019 family members who were invited to attend the ceremony.",
      "Critics say Japan\u2019s government has long been reluctant to discuss wartime atrocities. That includes what historians describe as the sexual abuse and enslavement of women across Asia, many of them Koreans who were deceived into providing sex to Japanese soldiers at frontline brothels and euphemistically called \u201ccomfort women,\u201d and the Koreans who were mobilized and forced to work in Japan, especially in the final years of World War II.",
      "Korean compensation demands for Japanese atrocities during its brutal colonial rule have strained relations between the two Asian neighbors, most recently after a 2018 South Korean Supreme Court ruling ordered Japanese companies to pay damages over their wartime forced labor.",
      "Japan\u2019s government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under the 1965 normalization treaty. Ties between Tokyo and Seoul have improved recently after Washington said their disputes over the historical issues were hampering crucial security cooperation as China\u2019s threat grows in the region.",
      "Japan's whitewashing of wartime atrocities has risen since the 2010s, particularly under the past government of revisionist leader Shinzo Abe. For instance, Japan says the terms \u201csex slavery\u201d and \u201cforced labor\u201d are inaccurate and insists on the use of highly euphemistic terms such as \u201ccomfort women\u201d and \u201ccivilian workers\u201d instead.",
      "South Korea\u2019s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol announced in March 2023 that his country would use a local corporate fund to compensate forced labor victims without demanding Japanese contributions. Japan\u2019s then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida later expressed sympathy for their suffering during a Seoul visit. Security, business and other ties between the sides have since rapidly resumed.",
      "Takeuchi said listing Japan\u2019s modern industrial historical sites as a UNESCO World Heritage is a government push to increase tourism. The government, he said, wants \u201cto commercialize sites like the Sado mines by beautifying and justifying their history for Japan\u2019s convenience.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- This past week has seen the most significant escalation in hostilities that Ukraine has witnessed since Russia's full-scale invasion and marks a new chapter in the nearly three-year war \u2014 one tinged with uncertainty and fear.",
      "It began with U.S. President Joe Biden reversing a longstanding policy by granting Kyiv permission to deploy American longer-range missiles inside Russian territory and ended with Moscow striking Ukraine with a new experimental ballistic weapon that has alarmed the international community and heightened fears of further escalation.",
      "Here is a look at the events in Ukraine in the span of a week that has fundamentally altered the stakes of the war:",
      "Washington eased limits on what Ukraine can strike with its American-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, after months of ruling out such a move over fears of escalating the conflict and bringing about a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.",
      "The change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said North Korean troops were inside Russia and being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops from Russia\u2019s Kursk region. But the scope of the new firing guidelines wasn\u2019t clear.",
      "The Kremlin warned that Biden\u2019s decision would escalate international tensions even higher.",
      "\u201cIt is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "Ukraine fired several ATACMS, striking an ammunition warehouse in Russia\u2019s Bryansk region, the first time Kyiv had used the weapons inside enemy territory, according to widespread reports. Ukrainian officials have not officially confirmed the strikes which occurred on the 1,000th day since the invasion.",
      "Also Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons, opening the door to a potential nuclear response by Moscow to even a conventional attack by any nation supported by a nuclear power. That could include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S.",
      "In the second major shift in U.S. policy, the Biden administration announced it will give Ukraine antipersonnel mines to help slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances. Biden had previously put off signing off on this because of international objections to the use of such mines due to the risks they pose to civilians. Russia deploys them freely.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the shift in Washington\u2019s policy was needed to counter changing Russian tactics.",
      "Ukraine also struck targets inside Russia using the British Storm Shadow missile, an equivalent of the ATACMS system, further vexing Moscow.",
      "The U.S. and some other Western embassies in Kyiv temporarily closed in response to the threat of a potentially major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital.",
      "The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine in response to Kyiv\u2019s use of American and British missiles, Putin said.",
      "In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at 10 times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik \u2014 Russian for hazelnut tree \u2014 based on Russia\u2019s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, which can carry nuclear warheads.",
      "Putin also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. Moscow gave Washington a 30-minute warning of the attack, which struck a weapons factory in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.",
      "NATO and Ukraine scheduled emergency talks slated for Tuesday, the alliance said. The meeting will be held at the request of Ukraine and will convene at the level of ambassadors.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s parliament also canceled a session as security was tightened in the city. Lawmakers said there was a credible threat of an attack on government buildings.",
      "Ukraine's partners weighed in on the dangerous new phase of the conflict. Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the conflict is \u201centering a decisive phase\" and \u201ctaking on very dramatic dimensions.\u201d"

      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has announced that his government plans to retire all coal and other fossil fuel-powered power plants within 15 years, while drastically boosting renewable energy capacity",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has announced that his government plans to retire all coal and other fossil fuel-power plants while drastically boosting the country's renewable energy capacity in the next 15 years.",
      "\u201cIndonesia is rich in geothermal resources, and we plan to phase out coal-fired and all fossil-fueled power plants within the next 15 years. Our plan includes building over 75 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity during this time,\u201d Subianto said at the summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Brazil on Tuesday.",
      "Subianto also said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Indonesia would achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a decade sooner than the country's previous 2060 commitment.",
      "Experts and environmental activists welcomed the announcements but hedged their expectations.",
      "Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers and consumers of heavily polluting coal and most of its energy comes from fossil fuels. Over 250 coal-fired power plants are currently powering the country and more are being built, including at new industrial parks where globally-important materials like nickel, cobalt and aluminum are being processed.",
      "In 2022, Indonesia\u2019s energy sector emitted over 650 million tons of carbon dioxide, the world\u2019s seventh highest level, according to the International Energy Agency. Population and economic growth are expected to triple the country\u2019s energy consumption by 2050.",
      "Experts said that real changes need to be implemented on the ground in Indonesia quickly if the president is serious about his plans.",
      "\u201cIf the government is serious about speeding up the energy transition, efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants and prevent new permits for the construction of coal-fired power plants must be clear so that partners, investors and financial institution can see the pipeline and progress,\u201d Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Indonesia-based Center of Economic and Law Studies, said in written statement to The Associated Press.",
      "While Subianto's predecessor, Joko Widodo, was in office Indonesia pledged to phase out \u2014 or at least drastically reduce \u2014 the use of coal by agreeing to numerous schemes with international stakeholders.",
      "That included the largest $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership deal so far. The deal has struggled to make changes on the ground but is still underway. JETP deals still fall short of the estimated trillions of dollars that are needed to develop infrastructure needed to transition to renewable energy and put existing coal-fired power plants into early retirement.",
      "In Brazil, Prabowo also spoke about Indonesia's vast renewable energy potential from solar, hydropower, geothermal, wind and other sources. Only 14.5% of these renewable sources are currently tapped, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Current installed capacity of renewable energy in Indonesia is about 13 gigawatts, or less than 15% of total generation capacity.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to renewable and green energy. We are blessed with many resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have other renewable energy sources, and that is why we are very optimistic that we can achieve (net) zero before 2050.\"",

So we are developing a green smart grid to increase wind and solar capacity almost eightfold ... by 2040 to enhance our energy security.\u201d",

      "Humanitarians \"are working courageously and selflessly in places like Gaza, Sudan, Lebanon, Ukraine and so on. They show the best humanity has to offer, and they are getting killed in return \u2014 in record numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThese numbers will send shockwaves around the humanitarian community, especially on the front lines of the response,\u201d he added.",
      "The U.N. said the figures come from the Aid Worker Security Database, a U.S.-funded project run by a Britain-based group called Humanitarian Outcomes.",
      "A total of 268 of the humanitarians killed \u2014 including from non-U.N. organizations like the Red Cross and Red Crescent \u2014 were national staff, while 13 were international staff.",
      "Some 230 aid workers have been killed in occupied Palestinian areas, the database showed Friday. It did not break out whether that was Gaza or the West Bank.",
      "Laerke said the threats to aid workers \u201cextend beyond Gaza, with high levels of violence, kidnappings injuries, harassment and arbitrary detention\" reported in Afghanistan, Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere.",
      "OCHA said a total of 333 humanitarians have been killed since the latest conflict between Israel and the militant Hamas group erupted when the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250.",
      "The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."

      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist Civic Coalition is holding a primary to choose a candidate who will run in the nation\u2019s presidential election next year",
      "Associated Press -- Associated Press (AP) \u2014 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist Civic Coalition held a primary Friday to select a candidate who will run in the nation's presidential election next year.",
      "Party members were choosing between Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, 52, a social liberal who has participated in LGBTQ+ pride parades, and Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, a 61-year-old who is seen as more conservative, to run in the election to succeed incumbent President Andrzej Duda.",
      "\u201cI am very proud of both of our candidates,\u201d Tusk said Friday, describing the contest as a healthy exercise in democracy. Party members had until midnight to vote by secured text message and Tusk was scheduled to announce the winner Saturday.",
      "Trzaskowski has long been considered the obvious candidate for Tusk\u2019s party, but was recently challenged by Sikorski\u2019s decision to run.",
      "Sikorski, who has served as a defense and foreign minister in past governments and has ties in Washington, argued that his experience in the areas of security and diplomacy made him the better choice at a time of war in neighboring Ukraine and political change in the United States.",
      "\u201cThere will be a reshuffle of the security architecture in our region. You can\u2019t learn in office \u2014 you have to get into it right away,\u201d Sikorski said in an interview with the Rzeczpospolita news site on Friday. \u201cI objectively know more about geopolitics, defense and security policy than Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski. I\u2019ve been doing this longer.\u201d",
      "Some of Sikorski's opponents argued that Sikorski's wife, the American writer and historian Anne Applebaum, would create difficulties in the U.S.-Polish relationship when Donald Trump enters the White House because she has criticized Trump in her writings. The headline of an article she wrote for The Atlantic in October was: \u201cTrump is speaking like Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini.\u201d",
      "The winner of Friday's contest was expected to be one of the most important candidates in a field of challengers from other parties.",
      "The conservative opposition party, Law and Justice led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, which governed Poland from 2015-23, has not named its candidate yet. That person is expected to be picked by Kaczy\u0144ski.",
      "The date of the presidential election has not yet been announced but a first round is expected to be held in May, and a possible runoff would be held two weeks later if no candidate gets an outright majority in the first round.",
      "Duda will complete his second five-year term in August 2025 and is prevented by the constitution from running again.",
      "It is a priority for Tusk to have an ally win the presidency because it will determine whether he can fulfil his agenda. He is currently unable to fulfill some of his campaign promises because Duda wields veto power over legislation, but also because of opposition within his own three-party coalition.",
      "Trzaskowski in his role has overseen a rapidly changing capital city of nearly 2 million people that has absorbed large numbers of Ukrainian refugees. He ran for president in 2020, and barely lost to Duda then.",
      "The Civic Coalition is led by Tusk's party Civic Platform and also includes smaller parties including the Greens."

      "An Interior Ministry statement said the mayor of the mainly Kurdish-populated provincial capital of Tunceli was removed from office due to his past conviction and an ongoing investigation for links to the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK. The district mayor for Ovacik, in Tunceli province, was sacked due to his past conviction of membership in the PKK, the statement said.",

      "Several other pro-Kurdish mayors have similarly been ousted from office following past elections.",
      "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government has defended the mayors' removals saying they are part of efforts to maintain security.",
      "Opposition parties and human rights groups, however, accuse the government of undermining democracy and say the charges brought against the mayors are often politically motivated.",
      "The PKK, which has led an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s, is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people."

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats, state media said Friday.",
      "Kim spoke Thursday at a defense exhibition where North Korea displayed some of its most powerful weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland as well as artillery systems and drones, according to text and photos published by the North\u2019s Korean Central News Agency. While meeting with army officers last week, he had pledged a \u201climitless\u201d expansion of his military nuclear program.",
      "Kim has yet to comment directly on Donald Trump's reelection as U.S. president. During his first term, Trump held three highly orchestrated summits with the North Korean leader in 2018 and 2019, before the diplomacy collapsed over disagreements on exchanging a relaxation of U.S.-led economic sanctions with North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear program.",
      "During the speech at the exhibition, Kim touched on the failed summits without naming Trump.",
      "\u201cWe have already gone as far as possible with the United States with negotiations, and what we ended up confirming was not a superpower\u2019s will for coexistence, but a thorough position based on force and an unchangeable invasive and hostile policy\u201d toward North Korea, Kim said.",
      "Kim accused the United States of raising military pressure on North Korea by strengthening military cooperation with regional allies and increasing the deployment of \u201cstrategic strike means,\u201d apparently a reference to major U.S. assets such as long-range bombers, submarines and aircraft carriers. He called for accelerated efforts to advance the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military, saying the country\u2019s only guarantee of security is to build up the \u201cstrongest defense power that can overwhelm the enemy.\u201d",
      "Kim's expanding nuclear weapons and missile programs include various weapons targeting South Korea and Japan and longer-range missiles that have demonstrated the range to reach the U.S. mainland. Analysts say Kim\u2019s nuclear push is aimed at eventually pressuring Washington into accepting North Korea as a nuclear power and to negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength.",
      "In recent months, the focus of Kim\u2019s foreign policy has been Russia as he tries to strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d and aligning with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s broader conflicts with the West.",
      "Washington and its allies have accused North Korea of providing Russia with thousands of troops and large amounts of military equipment, including artillery systems and missiles, to help sustain its fighting in Ukraine. Kim in return could possibly receive badly needed economic aid and Russian technology transfers that would possibly enhance the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military, according to outside officials and experts.",
      "North Korea also held a major arms exhibition in July last year and invited a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was given a personal tour by Kim that included a briefing on the North's expanding military capabilities, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to the Russia for a summit with Putin, which sped up military cooperation between the countries. North Korean state media photos of this year's exhibition showed various artillery systems, including what appeared to be 240mm multiple rocket launch systems that South Korea's spy agency believes were part of the North Korean weaponry recently sent to Russia. When asked whether North Korea was showcasing the systems it intends to export to Russia, Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, said he wouldn't make \u201cpremature judgments\u201d but said the government was \u201cmonitoring related trends.\" \u201cWe stress once again that arms transfers between Russia and North Korea are a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and an illegal act that undermines the norms of the international community,\u201d he said.",
      "Even with Trump returning to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely, according to some experts. North Korea's deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of sanctions against it are presenting further challenges in the push to resolve the nuclear standoff with Kim, who also has a greater perception of his bargaining power following the rapid expansion of his arsenal in recent years."

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade.",
      "The unveiling of the exhibition \u201cEye to Eye\u201d has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran's Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country's theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars.",
      "\u201cThe first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,\u201d said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum.",
      "\u201cIf such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it\u2019s enough. They are really precious.\u201d",
      "The government of Iran\u2019s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran\u2019s cultural standing on the world stage.",
      "But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum\u2019s vault. Some paintings \u2014 cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art \u2014 sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution.",
      "Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes.",
      "Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, \u201cJacqueline Kennedy II,\u201d is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that\u2019s why this show distinguishes itself from others,\u201d said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition's curator. \u201dA lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.\u201d",
      "The presence of Western art comes as Iran's government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a \u201csoft\u201d cultural war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country's politics or Shiite religion.",
      "Among the visitors were many women defying the country's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran's presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger.",
      "And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran's collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It\u2019s extremely exciting to see the works here,\u201d said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. \u201cI had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.\u201d",

      "Two Australian teenagers and a British woman have died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos",
      "BANGKOK -- Two Australian teenagers and a British woman died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. An American man and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander also has been sickened. The U.S. State Department issued a warning to travelers to be \u201calert to the potential risk of methanol poisoning.\u201d But what is methanol, and how do you avoid it?",
      "There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol and isopropyl. Ethanol is what is found in consumer spirits and is the only one intended for consumption. Isopropanol is the main ingredient in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Methanol, commonly called wood alcohol because it is the byproduct of wood distillation, is frequently used as fuel and in products such as antifreeze and solvents.",
      "According to the Methanol Institute, the global trade association for the industry, drinking just 25 to 90 ml (0.7 to 3.0 ounces) of methanol can be fatal without proper medical treatment, but can be successfully treated if caught early.",
      "Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness and decreased consciousness including coma, seizure, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and multiple other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention immediately if methanol poisoning is suspected.",
      "\u201cIndividuals vary in their response to methanol,\u201d said toxicologist Alastair Hay from Britain\u2019s University of Leeds. \u201cSome will be able to tolerate more than others because we all have variability in the capacity of our enzymes to detox. But small quantities ... might be fatal for individuals; others may survive slightly more.\u201d",
      "Methanol is sometimes added deliberately by unscrupulous bars to mixed drinks to give them more \u201ckick\u201d and to save money on using higher-priced ethanol-based spirits such as vodka or rum. This practice is not specific to Laos or Southeast Asia, but occurs wherever taxes on legitimate alcohol or the cost of legitimate alcohol is perceived as being too high, according to the Methanol Institute.",
      "Methanol is also a normal product of the distillation process that produces ethanol, and in home-brew distilleries without strict controls \u2014 often found in poorer countries \u2014 it can end up in the mix.",
      "The answer is easy: don't drink it.",
      "But it's colorless, odorless and tasteless, so that can be something of a challenge.",
      "In guidance issued after the Laos poisonings, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office recommends only purchasing alcoholic beverages from licensed liquor stores, buying drinks only from licensed bars and hotels, always checking if bottle seals are intact, and checking labels for poor print quality or incorrect spellings.",
      "The Methanol Institute notes that beverages such as canned beer, cider, wine, pre-mix, and duty-free products tend to be safer and less easy to adulterate.",
      "It also urges people to be wary of homemade brews, and free drinks or drinks priced far below normal.",

      "\u201cI would like for Romanians to feel that the leaders are rule-makers, not simply rule-takers,\u201d the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians leader told reporters Wednesday in Bucharest. Formed in 2019, the party known by its initials AUR proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom.\u201d",
      "The 38-year-old candidate, who is banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine over security concerns, strongly denied \"all the allegations regarding any kind of connections with the Russian intelligence officers.\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s presidential election has 13 candidates and is expected to go to a Dec. 8 runoff, potentially pitting Simion against Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who is backed by Romania's largest party, the Social Democratic Party, or PSD.",
      "The European Union and NATO member country will also hold parliamentary elections Dec. 1 that will determine Romania's next government and prime minister. The presidential role carries a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy.",
      "Ciolacu told The Associated Press he has a \u201cclear plan for a more developed Romania that leaves no one behind, an internal plan based on economic growth on investments and a plan for a more respected and influential Romania abroad.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we have political leaders who challenge our presence in the EU and NATO \u2026 I believe that extremists must be politically isolated and not taken into account by any government,\u201d the PSD leader added.",
      "Besides Ciolacu and Simion, other key candidates are Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, former NATO deputy general secretary Mircea Geoana, who is running independently, and Nicolae Ciuca, a former army general and prime minister of the center-right National Liberal Party, which is currently in a tense coalition with the PSD.",
      "Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, said polling data ahead of the race were unreliable, because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of attempts to generate a particular outcome.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll that I can say for sure is that it\u2019s probably going to be a fight between Simion and Lasconi,\" Tufis said. \"I think it depends on the mobilization both within Romania and outside Romania.\u201d",
      "Some voters feel that none of the candidates in Sunday\u2019s race is addressing issues they view as significant.",
      "\u201cI think we are in a situation where an economic and social crisis is more and more present in our lives,\u201d said Catrinel Toncu, a 24-year-old anthropology student. \u201cI don\u2019t see any discussion on upcoming systemic changes. ... Each of them is problematic, in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Simion has long been a figure of controversy. He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country. In 2020, the AUR party went from relative obscurity to gaining 9% in a parliamentary vote, allowing it to enter parliament.",
      "Opponents have accused Simion and AUR of being extremist. In 2022, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Romania condemned AUR for opposing a mandate for studying the Holocaust in Romania, which it deemed a \u201cminor issue.\u201d The party opposes same-sex marriage and has close ties to the Romanian Orthodox Church.",
      "At his party's campaign headquarters, Simion called Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201ca war criminal\u201d and said Western sanctions against Russia \u201cwere not enough.\u201d But he also said he opposes Romania \u2014 which has sent a Patriot missile system to Ukraine \u2014 contributing further military aid to its war-torn neighbor.",
      "\u201cI am not a fan of continuing the war, and I hope that President-elect Trump will stop this war,\" he said.",

      "\u201cI think the political establishment in Romania is lagging behind Romanian society,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a big country, we are strategically immensely relevant for all our partners and allies, but Romania should become a truly multi-regional player and power.\u201d",
      "The former NATO official also acknowledged the rise of populism, saying that people who vote \u201cfor such extreme solutions are the ones who were basically abandoned by the Romanian state and by the current political establishment, the ones in the small cities in Romania, the ones in the countryside.\u201d",

      "One of the main conditions of Romania\u2019s accession to the EU in 2007 was that it cracked down on endemic corruption. But it remains one of the bloc\u2019s most corrupt members, according to Transparency International.",
      "Lasconi said she favors increasing defense spending and that supporting Ukraine \u201cto win the war\u201d is essential. \u201cPutin is not afraid of NATO. He is afraid of freedom.

      "The Bahamas says it will refinance $300 million of its external debt to free up more than $120 million for marine conservation projects and climate change mitigation",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The Bahamas announced Friday that it will refinance $300 million of its external debt to free up more than $120 million for marine conservation projects and climate change mitigation.",
      "It is the fifth such debt-for-nature swap in the world, with the Bahamian government signing the deal with The Nature Conservancy, the Inter-American Development Bank and other financial partners.",
      "\u201cWe see this project not just supporting the biodiversity and climate objectives of the country, but ultimately the economy and livelihoods of many, many folks,\u201d Shenique Albury-Smith, the Bahamas-based deputy director for The Nature Conservancy, told The Associated Press.",
      "The deal involves buying back the existing debt via a new loan by Standard Chartered with reduced interest rates, a move expected to free up some $124 million in funding. That money will be used for marine conservation projects for the next 15 years. An endowment fund also will be created to secure financing for the projects after the 15 years are up. Overall, the Bahamas holds some $5.7 billion in external debt.",
      "The Seychelles, Belize, Gabon and Barbados previously signed similar deals, said Melissa Garvey, global director for The Nature Conservancy\u2019s bond program.",
      "Together, the deals protect conservation areas larger than the Gulf of Mexico, she said.",
      "The agreement with the Bahamian government marks the first time a private investor, Builders Vision, provides a co-guarantee and a private insurer, AXA XL, provides credit insurance. It\u2019s also the first time that the project includes climate change mitigation commitments, according to The Nature Conservancy.",
      "Smith said officials will likely use some of the money to protect, restore and manage the mangrove ecosystem, which stores carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, better than tropical forests. Officials also are looking to protect other ecosystems including seagrass, which also absorbs carbon dioxide, helping counter global warming.",
      "Protecting marine areas also would ensure the stability of commercially important fisheries in the Bahamas, with the spiny lobster one alone generating some $100 million a year, Albury-Smith said.",
      "In addition, climate change mitigation would help protect the low-lying archipelago that is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Dorian, which hit as a powerful Category 5 storm in 2019.",
      "The Bahamas already has a strong conservation history: more than 17% of coastal waters are protected, representing more than 6 million hectares (16 million acres) of the world\u2019s ocean.",
      "In 1958, the Bahamas established the world\u2019s first protected land and sea park at Exuma Cays.",

      "Police have formally accused Brazil\u2019s former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people of attempting a coup to keep the right-wing leader in office after his defeat in the 2022 elections",
      "SAO PAULO -- Police have formally accused Brazil\u2019s former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 others of attempting a coup to keep the right-wing leader in office after his electoral defeat in 2022. Their allegations threaten to torpedo Bolsonaro's hopes of returning to politics.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court said Friday that police findings were delivered to Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who next week will relay them to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet. He will decide whether to formally charge Bolsonaro or toss the investigation.",
      "Bolsonaro told the news website Metropoles on Thursday that he is waiting for his lawyer to review the police report, which is reportedly about 700 pages long, but that he would fight the case. He dismissed the investigation as the result of \u201ccreativity.\u201d",
      "The former president denies that he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has since faced a series of legal threats.",
      "That police are seeking formal charges indicates the investigation found evidence of \u201ca crime and its author,\u201d and it is likely there are legal grounds for the prosecutor-general to file charges, said Elo\u00edsa Machado de Almeida, a law professor at Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo.",
      "On Friday, the attorney for Bolsonaro\u2019s former right hand, Lt. Col. Mauro Cid, said in a live television interview that his client had informed the Supreme Court that Bolsonaro was aware of the coup plot.",
      "\u201cThe then-president knew it all. Actually, he led this organization,\u201d Cid\u2019s attorney, Cezar Bitencourt, told network GloboNews. Just minutes later, Bitencourt partially retracted his statement. \"I didn\u2019t say Bolsonaro knew it all. \u2018All\u2019 is a lot. He was evidently aware of some things.\u201d",
      "Police said the Supreme Court agreed to the release all 37 names in the police report \u201cto avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.\u201d",
      "Among them are dozens of former and current Bolsonaro aides, including: Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who was his running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander Gen. Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno.",
      "Braga Netto\u2019s lawyers said they would wait to formally receive the police documents before making any comments. The retired general shared their statement on X late Thursday.",
      "Bolsonaro is already accused separately of smuggling diamond jewelry into Brazil and directing Lt. Col. Cid to falsify his and others\u2019 COVID-19 vaccination statuses. Bolsonaro has denied those charges.",
      "Another probe found he abused his authority by casting doubt on Brazil's electoral system, and judges on the top electoral court barred him from running again until 2030.",
      "Still, he insists he will run in 2026, and many in his orbit were heartened by President-elect Donald Trump's recent election win despite his swirling legal troubles.",
      "Local media report that Gonet is already under pressure to move forward with multiple investigations against the former president, and politicians say if the 69-year-old Bolsonaro does stand trial his allies and rivals will race to seize his influence with voters.",
      "\u201cBolsonaro is no longer the sole leader of the right-wing. He is coming out of mayoral elections in which most of his candidates lost. All these probes don\u2019t help him at all,\u201d said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper, a university in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThe governor of Sao Paulo, Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas, the radical candidate for Sao Paulo mayorship Pablo Mar\u00e7al, the governor of Goias state, Ronaldo Caiado ... There are politicians lining up to court Bolsonaro voters,\u201d Melo said.",
      "Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, said the formal accusation is \u201cobviously bad\u201d for Bolsonaro, but that it might not impede him if he does decide to run for office again.",
      "\u201cThis could give those targeted a chance to portray themselves as being persecuted,\u201d de Souza said, adding that could benefit them.",
      "Bolsonaro's allies in Congress have been negotiating a bill to pardon individuals who stormed the Brazilian capital and rioted on Jan. 8, 2023, in an attempt to keep the former president in power. Analysts have speculated that lawmakers want to extend the legislation to cover the former president himself.",
      "However, efforts to push a broad amnesty bill would be \u201cpolitically challenging\u201d in light of the new allegations against Bolsonaro and others, Machado said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Police arrested four military and a Federal Police officer, accused of plotting to assassinate Lula and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes in an effort to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections.",
      "Last week, a man tried to enter the Supreme Court in the capital Brasilia with explosives but was blocked by guards. He threw the explosives outside the building, killing himself."

The amount pleases the countries who will be paying, but not those on the receiving end.",
      "It's more than double the previous goal of $100 billion a year set 15 years ago, but less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather. But rich nations say it's realistic and about the limit of what they can do.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he'll nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary, one of several personnel decisions that he unveiled as he closed out the workweek.",
      "Trump also said he would nominate Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget, the same position he held during Trump's first presidency. Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump's second term that the GOP nominee tried to distance himself from during the campaign.",
      "The announcements showed how Trump was trying to balance competing perspectives as he pursues an aggressive and sometimes contradictory economic agenda that includes cutting taxes, reducing government spending, putting tariffs on foreign imports and lowering prices for American consumers.",
      "Although Bessent is closely aligned with Wall Street and could earn bipartisan support, Vought is known as a Republican hardliner on budget and cultural issues.",
      "Trump said Bessent would \u201chelp me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States,\" while Vought \u201cknows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government.\u201d",
      "After announcing his choices for key financial posts, Trump kept up the pace of what has been a breakneck transition process.",
      "Trump picked Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, a rare Republican who is considered a stalwart union ally, as his labor secretary. He also said he would nominate Scott Turner, a former football player who worked in Trump's first administration, to serve as his housing secretary.",
      "More choices were named for health and national security positions. In less than three weeks since the election, Trump has announced decisions for almost his entire Cabinet.",
      "Bessent, 62, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation\u2019s first openly gay treasury secretary.",
      "He told Bloomberg in August that attacking the U.S. national debt should be a priority, which includes slashing government programs and other spending.",
      "\u201cThis election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,\u201d he said then.",
      "As of Nov. 8, the national debt stands at $35.94 trillion, with both the Trump and Biden administrations having added to it. Trump\u2019s policies added $8.4 trillion to the national debt, while the Biden administration increased the national debt by $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog.",
      "Even as he pushes to lower the national debt by stopping spending, Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from different economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years. Nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore\u2019s presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. Bessent had an influential role in Soros\u2019 London operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on \u201cBlack Wednesday,\u201d when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.",
      "Bessent previously told Bloomberg that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\u201d and he said tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives,\" such as encouraging allies to spend more on defense or deterring military aggression.",
      "In addition, Bessent has floated ideas for how Trump could put pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Last month, Bessent suggested Trump could name a replacement chair early, and let that person function as a \u201cshadow\u201d chair, with the goal of essentially sidelining Powell.",
      "But after the election, Bessent reportedly backed away from that plan. Powell, for his part, has said he wouldn\u2019t step down if Trump asked him to do so, and added that Trump, as president, wouldn't have the authority to fire him.",
      "Trump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term as president for raising the Fed\u2019s key rate in 2017 and 2018. During the 2024 campaign, he said that as president he should have a \u201csay\u201d in the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions. Presidents traditionally avoid commenting on the Fed\u2019s policies.",
      "Vought, 48, was the head of the Office of Management and Budget from mid-2020 to the end of Trump\u2019s first term in 2021, having previously served as the acting director and deputy director. He's paired a deep knowledge of government finances with his own Christian faith.",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as renewing \"a consensus of America as a nation under God.\u201d",
      "The Center for Renewing America released its own 2023 budget proposal entitled \u201cA Commitment to End Woke and Weaponized Government.\u201d The proposal envisioned $11.3 trillion worth of spending reductions over 10 years and about $2 trillion in income tax cuts in order to bring the budget into surplus by 2032.",
      "\u201cThe immediate threat facing the nation is the fact that the people no longer govern the country; instead, the government itself is increasingly weaponized against the people it is meant to serve,\u201d Vought wrote in the introduction.",
      "Vought\u2019s proposed budget plan would cut spending on food aid through the Agriculture Department. There would be $3.3 trillion in spending reductions in the Health and Human Services Department in large part through how Medicaid and Medicare funds are distributed. It also contains about $642 billion in cuts to Affordable Care Act. The budgets for the Housing and Urban Development and Education departments would also be cut.",
      "Vought\u2019s budget ideas were independent of Trump, who has not entirely spelled out the details of his economic plans.",
      "Trump's choice for labor secretary, Chavez-DeRemer, 56, narrowly lost her reelection bid earlier this month. She received strong backing from union members in her district.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer is one of a few House Republicans to endorse the \u201cProtecting the Right to Organize\u201d or PRO Act that would allow more workers to conduct organizing campaigns and would add penalties for companies that violate workers\u2019 rights. The act would also weaken \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that allow employees in more than half the states to avoid participating in or paying dues to unions that represent workers at their places of employment.",
      "Trump said in a statement that she would help \u201censure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success.\u201d",
      "In addition, Trump added to his health team on Friday evening. He chose Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a general practitioner and Fox News contributor, to be surgeon general; Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Republican congressman from Florida, to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, as head of the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Trump previously said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime spreader of conspiracy theories about vaccines, as health secretary.",
      "Alex Wong was named as principal deputy national security adviser, while Sebastian Gorka will serve as senior director for counterterrorism. Wong worked on issues involving Asia during Trump\u2019s first term, and Gorka is a conservative commentator who spent less than a year in Trump\u2019s first White House."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",

      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",

He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has announced that his government plans to retire all coal and other fossil fuel-power plants while drastically boosting the country's renewable energy capacity in the next 15 years.",
      "\u201cIndonesia is rich in geothermal resources, and we plan to phase out coal-fired and all fossil-fueled power plants within the next 15 years. Our plan includes building over 75 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity during this time,\u201d Subianto said at the summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Brazil on Tuesday.",
      "Subianto also said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Indonesia would achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a decade sooner than the country's previous 2060 commitment.",
      "Experts and environmental activists welcomed the announcements but hedged their expectations.",
      "Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers and consumers of heavily polluting coal and most of its energy comes from fossil fuels. Over 250 coal-fired power plants are currently powering the country and more are being built, including at new industrial parks where globally-important materials like nickel, cobalt and aluminum are being processed.",
      "In 2022, Indonesia\u2019s energy sector emitted over 650 million tons of carbon dioxide, the world\u2019s seventh highest level, according to the International Energy Agency. Population and economic growth are expected to triple the country\u2019s energy consumption by 2050.",
      "Experts said that real changes need to be implemented on the ground in Indonesia quickly if the president is serious about his plans.",
      "\u201cIf the government is serious about speeding up the energy transition, efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants and prevent new permits for the construction of coal-fired power plants must be clear so that partners, investors and financial institution can see the pipeline and progress,\u201d Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Indonesia-based Center of Economic and Law Studies, said in written statement to The Associated Press.",
      "While Subianto's predecessor, Joko Widodo, was in office Indonesia pledged to phase out \u2014 or at least drastically reduce \u2014 the use of coal by agreeing to numerous schemes with international stakeholders.",
      "That included the largest $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership deal so far. The deal has struggled to make changes on the ground but is still underway. JETP deals still fall short of the estimated trillions of dollars that are needed to develop infrastructure needed to transition to renewable energy and put existing coal-fired power plants into early retirement.",
      "In Brazil, Prabowo also spoke about Indonesia's vast renewable energy potential from solar, hydropower, geothermal, wind and other sources. Only 14.5% of these renewable sources are currently tapped, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Current installed capacity of renewable energy in Indonesia is about 13 gigawatts, or less than 15% of total generation capacity.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to renewable and green energy. We are blessed with many resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have other renewable energy sources, and that is why we are very optimistic that we can achieve (net) zero before 2050.\"",
      "A spokesperson from Indonesia's state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, said the corporation is \u201cfully committed\u201d to supporting the renewable energy target but admitted the transition will bring challenges.",
      "\u201cThere is a mismatch between the locations of large-scale renewable energy resources, such as hydro and geothermal, and the epicenters of our industry,\u201d PLN spokesperson Gregorius Adi Trianto said in written statement to AP. \u201cWe also face the challenge of intermittency in solar and wind power. So we are developing a green smart grid to increase wind and solar capacity almost eightfold ... by 2040 to enhance our energy security.\u201d",

      "That is squeezing smaller low-fare carriers like Spirit Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. Some travel-industry experts think Spirit\u2019s troubles indicate that travelers on a budget will be left with fewer choices and higher prices.",
      "Other discount airlines are on much better financial footing than Spirit, but they too are lagging far behind the full-service airlines when it comes to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most industry experts think Frontier Airlines and other so-called ultra-low-cost carriers will fill the vacuum if Spirit shrinks, and that there is still plenty of competition to prevent prices from spiking.",
      "Spirit Airlines has lost more than $2.2 billion since the start of 2020. Frontier has not reported a full-year profit since 2019, although that slump might end this year. And Allegiant Air\u2019s parent company is still profitable, but less so than before the pandemic.",
      "Those kind of numbers \u2014 and of course, some promotion of his own airline \u2014 led United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to declare recently that low-cost carriers were using \u201ca fundamentally flawed business model\u201d and customers hate flying on them.",
      "Kirby\u2019s touchdown dance might turn out to be premature, but many analysts are wary about the near-term prospects for budget airlines, which charge cheaper fares but more fees than the big airlines.",
      "Low-cost airlines grew in the last two decades by undercutting big carriers on ticket prices, thanks in large part to lower costs, including hiring younger workers who were paid less than their counterparts at Delta Air Lines, United and American Airlines. Wages have soared across the industry in the last two years, however, narrowing that cost advantage.",
      "At the same time, the big airlines rolled out and refined their no-frills, \u201cbasic economy\u201d tickets to compete directly with Spirit, Frontier and other budget carriers for the most price-sensitive travelers.",
      "The budget airlines have also become less efficient at using planes and people. As their growth slowed, they wound up with more of both than they needed. In 2019, Spirit planes were in the air an average of 12.3 hours every day. By this summer, the planes spent an average of two more hours each day sitting on the ground, where they don't make money.",
      "Spirit's costs per mile jumped 32% between 2019 and 2023.",
      "Another issue is that airlines added too many flights. Budget airlines and Southwest Airlines were among the worst offenders, but full-service airlines piled on. To make up for a drop in business travel, the big carriers added more flights on domestic leisure routes. The result: Too many seats on flights into popular tourist destinations such as Florida and Las Vegas, which drove down prices, especially for economy-class tickets.",
      "Tom Fitzgerald, an airline analyst at TD Cowen, said that after doing a good job tweaking their basic-economy offerings, the bigger airlines now are enjoying a boom on the premium travel side.",
      "\u201cPost-COVID, people have seemingly been willing to pay a lot more to have a better experience\" with flights and lodging, he said, \u201cand the legacy carriers are a lot better positioned to cater to that demand. They have premium economy, they have first-class.\u201d",
      "Low-cost airlines are responding by following the old adage that if you can't beat them, join them. That means going premium, following the rapidly growing household wealth among upper-income people.",
      "Frontier Airlines organized its fares into four bundles in May, with buyers of higher-priced tickets getting extras such as priority boarding, more legroom, and checked bags. The airline dropped ticket-change or cancellation fees except for the cheapest bundle.",
      "Spirit followed in August with similar changes, blocking middle seats and charging passengers more for the comfort of aisle and window seats.",
      "JetBlue Airways, which began flying more than 20 years ago as a low-cost carrier but with amenities, is digging out from years of steady losses. Under new CEO Joanna Geraghty, the first woman to lead a major U.S. airline, JetBlue is cutting unprofitable routes, bolstering core markets that include the Northeast and Florida, and delaying deliveries of $3 billion worth of new planes.",
      "Perhaps the biggest change is coming at Southwest Airlines. Starting next year, Southwest will toss out a half-century tradition of \u201copen seating\u201d \u2014 passengers picking their own seat after boarding the plane. Executives say extensive surveying showed that 80% of customers preferred an assigned seat, and that's especially true with coveted business travelers.",
      "Coming out of the pandemic, \u201cthere is a clear preference for more premium,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan said. \"Premium is kind of self-defined \u2014 whether that is extra legroom, first-class to Europe, whatever it is \u2014 but there is a rise in the desire for premium, something a little better.\u201d",
      "Jordan said it's not clear why demand for premium products and experiences have grown so rapidly, but figures on wealth offer one explanation.",
      "The top one-fifth of U.S. households by income have added $35 trillion in wealth since 2019 and holds nearly nine times the wealth of the middle fifth, according to the Federal Reserve. That gives the wealthiest households plenty of money to spend on premium travel.",
      "More crowded planes might also be pushing passengers to spend more to escape a middle seat in the back of the plane.",
      "Whatever the reasons, Delta executives say they expect sales of premium tickets will surpass the airline's revenue from main-cabin tickets by 2027.",
      "In other parts of the world, budget carriers are doing just fine. They have bounced back from the pandemic just like their more highbrow competitors.",
      "Some industry experts say low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe have always attracted a more diverse mix of passengers, while in the United States, affluent and middle-class travelers look down their noses at low-cost carriers.",
      "Jamie Baker, an analyst for JPMorgan, says he has many college friends who work in London and fly Irish airline Ryanair all the time, but he hardly knows anyone who has ever been on a Spirit or Frontier plane.",
      "\u201cThere is no stigma for anybody to fly Ryanair or easyJet in Europe. Meanwhile \u2014 not to pick on Spirit or kick them when they are down \u2014 but it\u2019s sort of the airline booty call,\u201d Baker recently told an audience of pilots for other airlines, who roared in laughter.",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian is less dismissive of the \u201clower-end carriers\u201d in the U.S. than United's Kirby.",
      "\"I don\u2019t see that segment ever disappearing,\u201d Bastian said this week, after Spirit\u2019s bankruptcy filing. \u201cI think there\u2019s a market for it.\u201d",
      "At the same time, he said the upscale moves by ultra-low-cost carriers are having no effect on his airline. Delta targets upscale travelers but also introduced basic-economy fares a decade ago, when discounters emerged as a growing threat to poach some of Delta's customers.",
      "\u201cJust calling yourself a premium carrier and actually being a premium carrier are two totally different things,\u201d Bastian said \u201cIt's not the size of the seat or how much room you have; it's the overall experience.\u201d",

      "The Competition and Markets Authority took aim at Apple, saying the iPhone maker's tactics hold back innovation by stopping rivals from giving users new features like faster webpage loading.

      "\u201cThis technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,\u201d the watchdog said in a provisional report on its investigation into mobile browsers that it opened after an initial study concluded that Apple and Google effectively have a chokehold on \u201cmobile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "The CMA's report also found that Apple and Google manipulate the choices given to mobile phone users to make their own browsers \u201cthe clearest or easiest option.\u201d",

      "Both companies said they will \u201cengage constructively\u201d with the CMA.",
      "Apple said it disagreed with the findings and said it was concerned that the recommendations would undermine user privacy and security.",

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

      "China is going to expand visa-free entry to citizens of nine more countries as it seeks to boost tourism and business travel to help revive a sluggish economy",
      "BEIJING -- China announced Friday that it would expand visa-free entry to nine more countries as it seeks to boost tourism and business travel to help revive a sluggish economy.",
      "Starting Nov. 30, travelers from Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Estonia, Latvia and Japan will be able to enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said.",
      "That will bring to 38 the number of countries that have been granted visa-free access since last year. Only three countries had visa-free access previously, and theirs had been eliminated during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The addition of Japan appears to reflect a recent willingness on China's part to improve ties, which have soured in part over more strident talk from Tokyo on the Taiwan issue. The two countries reached a deal in September in their dispute over the release into the sea of treated but still radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant.",
      "Japan was one of the three countries with visa-free entry before the pandemic, and the government had repeatedly requested an early resumption, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "\u201cWe hope the visa exemption measure announced by the Chinese side will contribute to further smooth our exchanges between Japan and China,\u201d he said.",
      "The permitted length of stay for visa-free entry is being increased from the previous 15 days, Lin said, and people participating in exchanges will be eligible for the first time. China has been pushing people-to-people exchange between students, academics and others to try to improve its sometimes strained relations with other countries.",
      "China strictly restricted entry during the pandemic and ended its restrictions much later than most other countries. It restored the previous visa-free access for citizens of Brunei and Singapore in July 2023, and then expanded visa-free entry to six more countries \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia \u2014 on Dec. 1 of last year.",
      "The program has since been expanded in tranches. Some countries have announced visa-free entry for Chinese citizens, notably Thailand, which wants to bring back Chinese tourists.",
      "For the three months from July through September this year, China recorded 8.2 million entries by foreigners, of which 4.9 million were visa-free, the official Xinhua News Agency said, quoting a Foreign Ministry consular official."

      "The regulator agency said that UPS materially misrepresented its earnings because it failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles in valuing its freight unit.",
      "The SEC order said that in 2019 UPS determined that its freight division was likely to sell for no more than about $650 million. UPS\u2019s own analysis indicated that nearly $500 million of goodwill it had associated with the unit was impaired.",
      "But instead of using its own analysis, the SEC said that UPS relied on an outside consultant\u2019s valuation of the freight division, without giving the consultant information necessary to conduct a fair valuation of the business. The commission said that the consultant used assumptions approved by UPS and then estimated that the freight unit was worth about $2 billion \u2013 three times as much as UPS had determined.",
      "Goodwill impairment is a term used in accounting to recognize that the face value of an asset on paper exceeds its fair value.",
      "Based on the consultant's estimate, UPS didn't record a goodwill impairment in 2019, the SEC said. Had UPS properly valued the division, its earnings and other reported items would have been materially lower.",
      "The SEC\u2019s order also alleges that in 2020 UPS entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell the freight unit for $800 million with adjustments to be made later that were likely to reduce the final price.",

      "The low-budget movie \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into a lo-fi legend",
      "NEW YORK -- Hard as it may be to believe, changing the future of cinema was not on Mike Cheslik\u2019s mind when he was making \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d Cheslik was in the Northwoods of Wisconsin with a crew of four, sometimes six, standing in snow and making his friend, Ryland Tews, fall down funny.",
      "\u201cWhen we were shooting, I kept thinking: It would be so stupid if this got mythologized,\u201d says Cheslik.",
      "And yet, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has accrued the stuff of, if not quite myth, then certainly lo-fi legend. Cheslik\u2019s film, made for just $150,000 and self-distributed in theaters, has managed to gnaw its way into a movie culture largely dominated by big-budget sequels.",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a wordless black-and-white bonanza of slapstick antics about a stranded 19th century applejack salesman (Tews) at war with a bevy of beavers, all of whom are played by actors in mascot costumes.",
      "No one would call \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d expensive looking, but it\u2019s far more inventive than much of what Hollywood produces. With some 1,500 effects shots Cheslik slaved over on his home computer, he crafted something like the human version of Donald Duck\u2019s snowball fight, and a low-budget heir to the waning tradition of Buster Keaton and \u201cNaked Gun.\u201d",
      "At a time when independent filmmaking is more challenged than ever, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has, maybe, suggested a new path forward, albeit a particularly beaver-festooned path.",
      "After no major distributor stepped forward, the filmmakers opted to launch the movie themselves, beginning with carnivalesque roadshow screenings. Since opening in January, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has played in at least one theater every week of the year, though never more than 33 at once. (Blockbusters typically play in around 4,000 locations.) More than half of its approximately $500,000 in ticket sales came after the movie went to video-on-demand.",
      "Daniel Scheinert, the co-director of the best picture-winning \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d recently called \u201cHundreds of \u201cBeavers\u201d \u201cthe future of cinema.\u201d That bold pronouncement, which ricocheted around film blogs, might seem extreme for a movie about a guy wearing a comically large beaver hat.",
      "But in a shrinking movie industry, DIY microbudget filmmaking may increasingly be left to fill some of the void left by risk-averse, corporate-driven Hollywood.",
      "\u201cI hope people can stop shooting things to make them look like commercials and just get back to more of the nitty gritty and letting your imagination flow,\u201d says Tews, who also co-wrote the movie with Cheslik. \u201cI just hope we stop bowing down to Hollywood and thinking they\u2019re the gold standard.

      "The year-to-date box office in North America is down 11% from last year and about 25% from before the pandemic. More movies are making a tiny impact in theaters; according to Franchise Entertainment Research, 41 wide releases in 2024 have grossed less than $3 million \u2014 nearly three times the amount in 2019.",
      "The costs not just to make wide-release films but to market them has greatly shifted what even indie distributors are willing to back. Just to get eyeballs on \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which carries a $250 million budget, Paramount Pictures took the extraordinary step of running a trailer of the film simultaneously on more than 4,000 platforms, including TV networks, radio stations and digital outlets. For even the biggest movies, it\u2019s hard to get people\u2019s attention.",
      "In such an environment, where the expense of making and marketing a movie is potentially prohibitive for everything but the safest of bets, more filmmakers are questioning the economics. That\u2019s especially because after last year\u2019s strikes, movie production hasn\u2019t rebounded. In a contracting movie industry, many remain out of work.",
      "Brady Corbet, director of the highly touted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d a 3 \u00bd-hour epic shot in VistaVision, for less than $10 million, has preached that smaller budgets don\u2019t have to mean less artistic ambition. Sean Baker, whose breakthrough film \u201cTangerine\u201d was shot with iPhones, has argued movie budgets can come down without sacrificing what\u2019s on the screen. His $6 million \u201cAnora\u201d is one of the year\u2019s most acclaimed films.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s panic in LA,\u201d Baker said in an earlier interview. \u201cI\u2019m like: We don\u2019t have to make films for that much. They don\u2019t have to cost as much.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a more micro example, but it was likewise made with a strong belief in the big screen. On Dec. 5, the movie will begin an encore tour in theaters, at some 70 locations. That\u2019s the widest release yet for \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d nearly a year after it opened. They\u2019re calling it \u201cA Northwoods Christmas.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a victory tour (with a Blu-ray release to follow) for \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d a barnstorming indie hit that Cheslik hopes shows aspiring filmmakers that the same kind of goofy inventiveness that goes into a TikTok video can be channeled into a movie.",
      "\u201cYou still can do whatever you want,\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to stop you if you take a phone and make a 90-minute timeline instead of a 30-second timeline.\"",

      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",

      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",

      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",

      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",

      "Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Musk\u2019s criticism was \u201cunsurprising\u201d after the government introduced to Parliament on Thursday legislation that would fine platforms including X up to 150 million Australian dollars ($133 million) if they allow children under age 16 to hold social media accounts.",

      "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
      "Disabled people who use rideshare apps Lyft and Uber say their experience is not a seamless task of pressing a few buttons and being whisked to their destination minutes later.",
      "Instead, people who use wheelchairs and guide dogs have watched drivers cancel rides, charge cleaning fees for guide dogs or outright refuse to take them where they need to go.",
      "The rideshare companies plan to push app updates soon to address cancellations and misunderstandings, but advocates and disabled users say they want to see drivers be better educated about how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and want the companies to put in stricter discrimination policies. The new app features are just \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d said Lynn Dubinsky.",
      "\u201cThis option puts the burden back on the client rather than on the companies themselves to directly address (discrimination) with their drivers,\u201d said Dubinsky, who works for a guide-dog training school in San Rafael, California.",
      "Uber and Lyft have been the target of past federal lawsuits that allege they didn't follow ADA laws; Uber settled its suit in 2022 and Lyft settled a separate one in 2020. While rideshare apps aren't the only option for disabled people across the U.S. \u2014 public transit agencies must also have ADA-compliant buses and trains and offer paratransit options like shuttles \u2014 the disabled community relies on rideshare more than others, according to 2022 U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics.",
      "That's the case for Amber Sherrard, who is blind and has a guide dog named Della.",
      "The 32-year-old Denver resident has grown accustomed to drivers refusing to transport Della, whom she prefers to bring along instead of using a cane, which she says is less safe. Once, she ended up getting a ride from strangers at Denver's airport because a rideshare driver wouldn't allow Della in the car.",
      "Uber's app update will give users a way to identify as blind or deaf. Lyft will allow users to tell a driver they have a service animal \u2014 something that Uber launched as a small pilot program earlier this week in the U.S. and Canada. Both rideshare companies have hotlines for people to report drivers who refuse to allow them into their cars with a service animal.",
      "Sherrard said she's skeptical that the new app features will help, since she usually informs drivers about her guide dog and figured out how to add that she's visually impaired to her profile name to cut down on cancellations.",
      "\u201cJust like every other person in America working multiple jobs, trying to survive, I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d she said of drivers who've denied her rides. \u201cI have just as many bills as anyone else. I have just as many working hours as everyone else. I have just as many errands and things to do to survive as anyone else.\u201d",
      "Robert Silva has had issues with rideshare drivers because of his folding wheelchair, which he has used since losing his right leg in a car accident. The 34-year-old from Alameda, California, said he once tried ordering a rideshare five times in an hour and a half to go to Disneyland before a driver accepted his request.",
      "\u201cThey just see me in a wheelchair, first thing, and they\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s going to be a lot of baggage there,\u201d said Silva, who usually can get into a vehicle without assistance. \u201cI\u2019m sure when they see me they think it\u2019s going to be a lot more work than it actually is.\u201d",
      "Uber and Lyft said their disability policies include following the ADA and not denying rides to people solely because they have a guide dog. The companies also said new drivers are made aware of the policies during onboarding, and that established drivers get occasional reminders of disability policies. If drivers wrongfully decline to accommodate riders because of a service animal, they face a potential ban.",
      "Under the ADA, U.S. cities that have public transportation must provide paratransit at a comparable cost to the regular transit system.",
      "Cathy Johnston, 70, uses Atlanta's MARTA Mobility paratransit program so she doesn't have to leave her power wheelchair behind for a foldable wheelchair like she does when using Uber or Lyft. It's not as timely as rideshare; Johnston said she's had to wait up to 45 minutes \u2014 even after scheduling it at least 24 hours in advance.",
      "\u201cIt makes me mad because hey, I have things I have to do,\u201d she said.",
      "In recent years, 36 transportation programs in 15 states and Washington, D.C., have bolstered paratransit offerings with Uzurv, a rideshare company that specializes in door-to-door service for people with disabilities. The company says it immediately bans drivers who discriminate against disabled riders.",
      "Portland, Oregon, lost a third of its cab fleet because of a drop in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon after, TriMet, the city\u2019s public transit operation, signed a contract with Uzurv.",
      "It's been an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d solution that Eileen Collins Turvey, TriMet's director of accessibility programs, is satisfied with \u2014 so much so that she hopes to make it an on-demand service next year.",
      "But first, she wants to be able to expand all paratransit contractors\u2019 ability to serve wheelchair users.",

      "The state Division of Gaming Enforcement issued statistics showing that the nine casinos had a collective gross operating profit of $236.5 million in the third quarter. That was down 13.8% from the third quarter of 2023.",
      "It was the latest indication of how the casinos continue to struggle with economic conditions and a shift in consumer preferences after the COVID19 pandemic. More businesses have migrated to online gambling, where the money won from bettors must be shared with outside parties and is not solely for the casinos to keep.",
      "Although all nine casinos were profitable in the third quarter, only two \u2014 Caesars and Hard Rock \u2014 saw their operating profits increase compared to a year earlier.",
      "\u201cConsumer demand may have been an issue for Atlantic City\u2019s casino operators in summer 2024,\u201d said Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry.",
      "She noted that the average hotel room rate declined by $17 in the third quarter, indicating that casino operators may have had to lower their rates to attract customers. The absence of large-scale tourism events like the annual air show and large beach concerts this summer also likely contributed to the downturn, she said.",
      "Revenue from things other than gambling also underperformed in the third quarter at $511.6 million, down 5% from a year earlier. These revenues are traditionally strongest during the summer months.",
      "James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said \u201cpressure from continuing high costs can be seen in lower profits compared to the same period last year.\u201d",
      "Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other expenses, and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City gambling industry.",
      "The Borgata had the highest operating profit at $60 million, down nearly 18% from a year earlier; Hard Rock earned $45.4 million, up 2.4%; Ocean earned $36.5 million, down 15.3%; Tropicana earned $30.5 million, down nearly 17%; Caesars earned nearly $23.5 million, up 11.2%; Harrah's earned $22.6 million, down nearly 25%; Bally's earned $6.5 million, down nearly 11%; Golden Nugget earned $6.2 million, down nearly 44%; and Resorts earned $4.9 million, down 32.6%.",
      "Among internet-only entities, Caesars Interactive NJ earned $4.8 million, down 7.8%, and Resorts Digital, the former online arm of Resorts casino, earned $1.5 million, down 4.8%.",
      "For the first nine months of this year, the casinos have posted a collective gross operating profit of $547 million, down 9.2% from the same period last year.",
      "The Ocean Casino Resort had the highest average nightly hotel room rate in the third quarter at $335.63; Golden Nugget had the lowest at $124.70. The average among the nine casinos was $201.08.",

      "Bessent had an influential role in Soros\u2019 London investment operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on \u201cBlack Wednesday,\u201d when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office, though estimates from various economic analysis of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "Bessent calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that the tax extension would add to the federal deficit.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a negotiation with the Republican Congress,\" Bessent told CNBC on Nov. 6. \u201cI\u2019ve already been in conversations with a lot of the Republicans who will chair those committees,\" he said. \"The Republican Congress, there's a big appetite for pay-fors. It will be a negotiation.\u201d",
      "He has in media interviews spoken about the need to tackle the nation's debt. \u201cI do think this debt and deficit is going to be the big issue of the day. I think Americans are worried about it.\" He argues that consumer prices can be brought down \"by starting with a deficit reduction program.\u201d",
      "Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "Bessent told Bloomberg in August that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\" and tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. \"I think that tariffs in a way can be regarded as an economic sanction without a sanction. If you don't like Chinese economic policy, flooding the market with over production, you could put a sanction on them, or a tariff. Its also an answer to currency manipulation.\u201d",
      "And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives.

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has named Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions in her district but lost reelection in November",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has named Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions in her district but lost reelection in November",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his second administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions in her district but lost reelection in November.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer will have to be confirmed by the Senate, which will be under Republican control when Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, and can formally send nominations to Capitol Hill.",
      "Here are things to know about the labor secretary-designate, the agency she would lead if she wins Senate approval and how she could matter to Trump's encore presidency.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer is a one-term congresswoman, having lost reelection in her competitive Oregon district earlier this month. But in her short stint on Capitol Hill she has established a clear record on workers' rights and organized labor issues that belie the Republican Party's usual alliances with business interests.",
      "She was an enthusiastic back of the PRO Act, legislation that would make it easier to unionize on a federal level. The bill, one of Democratic President Joe Biden's top legislative priorities, passed the House during Biden's first two years in office, when Democrats controlled the chamber. But it never had a chance of attracting enough Republican senators to reach the 60 votes required to avoid a filibuster in the Senate.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer also co-sponsored another piece of legislation that would protect public-sector workers from having their Social Security benefits docked because of government pension benefits. That proposal also has lingered for a lack of GOP support.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer may give labor plenty to like, but union leaders are not necessarily cheering yet. Many of them still do not trust Trump.",
      "The president-elect certainly has styled himself as a friend of the working class. His bond with blue-collar, non-college educated Americans is a core part of his political identity and helped him chip away at Democrats' historical electoral advantage in households with unionized workers.",
      "But he was also the president who chose business-friendly appointees to the National Labor Relations Board during his 2017-21 term and generally has backed policies that would make it harder for workers to unionize. He criticized union bosses on the campaign trail, and at one point suggested members of the United Auto Workers should not pay their dues. His administration did expand overtime eligibility rules, but not nearly as much as Democrats wanted, and a Trump-appointed judge has since struck down the Biden administration's more generous overtime rules.",
      "And though Trump distanced himself from the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 during the campaign, he has since his victory warmed to some of the people involved in that conservative blueprint that, broadly speaking, would tilt power in the workplace even more toward employers and corporations. Among other ideas, the plan also would curb enforcement of workplace safety regulations.",
      "After Trump's announcement Friday, National Education Association President Becky Pringle lauded Chavez-DeRemer's House record but sounded a note of caution.",
      "\u201cEducators and working families across the nation will be watching ... as she moves through the confirmation process,\u201d Pringle said in a statement, \u201cand hope to hear a pledge from her to continue to stand up for workers and students as her record suggests, not blind loyalty to the Project 2025 agenda.\u201d",
      "AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler praised Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s \u201cpro-labor record in Congress,\u201d but said \u201cit remains to be seen what she will be permitted to do as Secretary of Labor in an administration with a dramatically anti-worker agenda.\u201d",
      "Labor is another executive department that often operates away from the spotlight. But Trump's emphasis on the working class could intensify attention on the department, especially in an administration replete with tremendously wealthy leaders, including the president-elect.",
      "Trump took implicit aim at the department's historically uncontroversial role of maintaining labor statistics, arguing that Biden's administration manipulated calculations of unemployment and the workforce.",
      "If she is confirmed, Chavez-DeRemer could find herself standing between the nonpartisan bureaucrats at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a president with strong opinions about government stats and what they say about the state of the economy \u2014 and the White House's stewardship. Her handling of overtime rules also would be scrutinized, and she could find herself pulled into whatever becomes of Trump's promise to launch the largest deportation force in U.S. history, potentially pitting Trump's administration against economic sectors and companies that depend heavily on immigrant labor.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Oregon. She joins Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, as the second Latino pick for Trump's second Cabinet. Trump's first labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, also was Latino."

      "The win preserved the Rebels' hopes of returning to the Mountain West title game after losing to Boise State last season. UNLV still needs to win next week and hope Colorado State loses at least one more time to have a chance to get back into the title game.",
      "San Jose State (6-5, 3-4) lost for the second straight week at home to a ranked team, having fallen 42-21 to No. 13 Boise State last week. The Spartans have lost 12 straight games against ranked opponents since beating Fresno State in 2013.",
      "With both teams struggling to throw the ball, the Rebels relied on the running game to take control of the game in the second half. Thomas capped a 74-yard drive by scoring on a 25-yard run late in the third quarter to give UNLV a 20-16 lead.",
      "Kylin James added a 7-yard TD run to cap an 80-yard drive that made it 27-16 midway through the fourth.",
      "\u201cIt was ugly and terrible conditions,\u201d coach Barry Odom said. \u201cThey showed good resolve and toughness. They stood together and overcame some things that didn\u2019t go our way. ... It shows a lot about who we are and who are character is within the team and how tough we are.\u201d",
      "The wet and windy conditions led to sloppy play and struggles in the passing game. Both teams also had botched snaps that led to scores with UNLV recovering an errant shotgun snap at the San Jose State 17 to set up a field goal and the Spartans getting a safety after a high snap on a punt that punter Marshall Nichols batted out of the back of the end zone.",
      "San Jose State also scored on a pick-6 when Isiah Revis returned an interception by Williams 40 yards for a score.",
      "UNLV: The performance wasn't pretty with Hajj-Malik Williams going 11 for 20 for 131 yards with one TD and the interception. But the running game and defense helped deliver the Rebels their first win in San Jose since 1993.",
      "San Jose State: After throwing for 841 yards the previous two weeks, Walker Eget struggled to complete a pass in the adverse conditions. He went 4 for 22 passing for 81 yards with only one completion for 9 yards to star Nick Nash. Nash came into the game leading the nation in receptions, receiving yards and TD catches.",
      "The Spartans finished with 95 yards in penalties and 112 yards of offense.",
      "UNLV: Hosts Nevada next Saturday.",
      "San Jose State: Hosts Stanford on Friday.",

      "Douglas lost his job as the general manager on Tuesday, six weeks after the head coach was replaced following a 2-3 start. The Jets have gone 1-5 under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich so owner Woody Johnson sent Douglas packing.",
      "Rodgers has played more like a 40-year-old quarterback coming off an Achilles tendon injury than a four-time NFL MVP. He\u2019s expressed a desire to play another season. The big question is whether the Jets will want him back. Maybe they\u2019ll decide to take one more shot at a playoff run with Rodgers while having him mentor a rookie quarterback. Or, they could start fresh. There are significant contract ramifications either way.",
      "Rodgers is slated to make a non-guaranteed $37.5 million in 2025 with a dead cap hit of $49 million as his salary cap total goes from $17.1 million to $23.5 million.",
      "The Jets could spread the dead money over two years by releasing Rodgers with the use of post-June 1 designation. He has a no-trade clause in his contract so they would need his permission to make a deal.",
      "If Rodgers doesn\u2019t retire and New York\u2019s new regime wants a clean slate, here are potential destinations for the future first-ballot Hall of Famer:",
      "SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS: This could only happen if Brock Purdy\u2019s shoulder injury is more significant than is known. Rodgers is a native of northern California and grew up a Niners fan. Returning home to help San Francisco win its sixth Super Bowl has to be attractive. Playing for coach Kyle Shanahan surrounded by playmakers Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle would be a quarterback\u2019s dream. Again, Purdy is the team\u2019s present and future. And, he\u2019s resilient. Purdy rebounded from elbow surgery following his rookie season to start Week 1 last year and ended up finishing fourth in MVP voting, leading the 49ers to the Super Bowl. Purdy also is due for a contract extension and a major raise so the salary cap makes this even more of a longshot. But never say never in the NFL.",
      "MINNESOTA VIKINGS: Sam Darnold has been more than a stopgap, helping the Vikings (8-2) to an impressive start. J.J. McCarthy is the future, however, and Darnold will be a free agent after the season. If the Vikings fall short of a Super Bowl and Rodgers shows over the final six weeks that he can play championship football, this could be a fit. The Vikings could let McCarthy sit and learn for another year, especially coming off a knee injury that required a second surgery earlier this month.",
      "NEW YORK GIANTS: Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have to move. The Giants will need a quarterback after benching Daniel Jones this week with the intent to move on from him. They could draft a quarterback in the first round and have him learn behind Rodgers for a season. That\u2019ll depend on which pick New York ends up with because it\u2019s a thin draft class. Unlike the Jets, the Giants (2-8) haven\u2019t made any coaching or GM changes yet. If it\u2019s status quo with GM Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll, one year with Rodgers isn\u2019t unrealistic.",
      "LAS VEGAS RAIDERS: They also need a quarterback. Brock Bowers could set an NFL record for most catches by a tight end if he had Rodgers next season. The Raiders (2-8) are aiming for a high pick to get a shot at a quarterback of their choice. New minority owner Tom Brady believes rookie quarterbacks need time to develop and learn. The seven-time Super Bowl champion would have to be in favor of having Rodgers start and tutor a youngster.",
      "TENNESSEE TITANS: If Will Levis doesn\u2019t prove over the final seven games that he can be a No. 1 quarterback, the Titans (2-8) will be in the QB market and likely have a high draft pick. It\u2019s another scenario where Rodgers would fit as a one-year bridge.",

      "With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased",
      "LAS VEGAS -- With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased.",
      "So much so that F1 and Formula One Management could have a decision to grant the General Motors-backed entry a spot as the 11th team on the grid in the coming weeks. Dan Towriss, now the majority owner of the Andretti organization, was at the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Thursday scoping his chances of entering the top motorsports series in the world.",
      "So was the FBI, allegedly, as part of a Department of Justice investigation into why F1 denied the Andretti organization expansion into the series. F1 currently has 10 teams that field 20 cars and only one \u2014 the organization owned by California businessman Gene Haas \u2014 is an American team.",
      "Las Vegas marks the third race this season in the United States, more than any other country, as F1 has exploded in American popularity over the last five years.",
      "Even so, Andretti could not get approval from F1 to enter the series. But, the situation changed in September when Andretti scaled back his role with his namesake organization.",
      "Now with Towriss in charge, talks have amplified, even though it is not clear what the name of an Andretti-less F1 team would even be. Cadillac would do the engines \u2014 but says it won't be ready until 2028 \u2014 which means a 2026 Towriss-led F1 team would be GM branded but with a partner engine supplier.",
      "Most of the existing teams have been largely opposed to an 11th team entering F1, citing a dilution in prize money and the massive expenses they've already committed to the series. But, Andretti among others believed the teams' position was personal in that they simply didn't like Andretti, who ran 13 races in the 1993 season. His father, Mario, is the 1978 F1 world champion.",
      "The Andretti application had already been approved by the FIA, which is F1's ruling body, but later denied by F1 itself. F1 promised to revisit the issue once General Motors had an engine ready to compete.",
      "The existing 10 F1 teams have no actual vote or say in if the grid is expanded, which Mercedes boss Toto Wolff reiterated Thursday when The Associated Press asked why the sudden chance of acceptance in a potential 11th team.",
      "\u201cWe have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors, to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we\u2019ve done that,\u201d Wolff said. \"I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story.",
      "\u201cAnd as long as it is creative, that means we\u2019re growing the popularity of the sport, we\u2019re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I\u2019m putting my hope in there.\u201d",
      "Wolff has been eager to hear from Towriss directly on what the plans for the organization are now that Andretti has a smaller role.",
      "\u201cNo one from Andretti or Andretti Global or whatever the name will be has ever spoken to me a single sentence in presentation of what the creative part is,\u201d he said. \"But they don\u2019t need to because the teams don\u2019t decide. It is the commercial rights holder, with the FIA, we have no say. If I want to be invited to a party and go to the party, I\u2019m sitting down at the table and telling who I am and why I\u2019m really good fun and sitting here and everybody will enjoy my presence.",
      "\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened, but you know, that\u2019s now my personal point of view, not a professional, because there\u2019s nothing we can do, nothing we can say,\u201d Wolff continued. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know the people. I\u2019ve obviously spoken to Mario. I didn\u2019t speak to his son. I didn\u2019t speak to any other people that are behind that. I don\u2019t know who they are. So I know GM, GM is great.\u201d",
      "Fred Vasseur, team principal at Ferrari, said he's not opposed to another team if it adds value to F1.",
      "\u201cThe discussion is between FIA, the team, and FOM. It\u2019s not our choice,\u201d he said. \u201cFor sure, as Toto said, that if it\u2019s good for the sport, good for the show, good for the business, and adds value on the sporting side, that we are all OK.\u201d",

      "The 27-year-old Jones told reporters Thursday that he gave the team everything he had after being taken sixth overall in the 2019 draft and he believes he still has a future in the NFL. He held himself accountable for the Giants (2-8) making the postseason once in his tenure as the starter.",

      "Tommy DeVito will start Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with Daboll hoping he can spark the team.",
      "\u201cDefinitely not happy about it,\u201d said Jones, who read a 90-second statement before taking questions from reporters. \u201cYeah, not what you want to hear. So, yeah, all those emotions you have. But at the end of the day, this is football. We\u2019re in a business where you're expected to get results and we weren\u2019t doing it.\u201d",
      "Jones, who is now free to sign with any team, went 24-44-1 as a starter in New York after being the sixth overall pick in the 2019 draft. A significant portion of those victories came in 2022, when the Giants went 9-7-1 and beat Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs.",
      "Yet whatever forward momentum the club generated in 2022 quickly evaporated in 2023. New York was 1-5 in Jones' six starts during an injury-marred season and he further regressed this fall.",
      "Jones completed just 63% of his passes with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions even with dynamic rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers at his disposal. The Giants are last in the NFL in scoring and with public sentiment all but gone for the player once known as \u201cDanny Dimes,\u201d Daboll opted to go in another direction while Jones can get a head start on trying to reboot his career elsewhere.",

      "Lionel Messi is on the cusp of reuniting with former Argentina national teammate Javier Mascherano with Inter Miami, this time as player and coach, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Multiple reports out of Argentina said Mascherano has already agreed to take over as coach at Inter Miami as the replacement for Gerardo \u201cTata\u201d Martino \u2014 who stepped down citing personal reasons. Mascherano emerged as Inter Miami's frontrunner earlier this week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decision has been revealed by the team.",
      "Inter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas said the team had three finalists in mind for the job, then made a pick on the replacement Wednesday \u2014 but would not confirm that the deal with Mascherano is done, or that he even was the final selection.",
      "\u201cWe are very near the end of the process,\u201d Mas said. \u201cWe will be announcing a new coach for Inter Miami in the upcoming days.\"",
      "Messi and Mascherano were teammates both for Argentina and with Barcelona; for the Spanish club, Mascherano also played alongside current Inter Miami standouts Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez. Mascherano, at one time, was the all-time leader for Argentina\u2019s national team in international appearances; Messi has since broken that record.",
      "Mas said he spoke with Messi last week about the coaching search. It\u2019s not known if Messi played an active role in recruiting Mascherano, who currently is Argentina\u2019s U-20 national coach.",
      "\u201cI asked him, 'What is important to you? And what do you think is important to get the best out of our roster and out of our 11 and how do we improve?\u201d Mas said. \u201cAnd Leo shared with me his thoughts. ... Without a doubt, a familiarity with Leo and the other stars is an advantage in every aspect. Obviously, I want Leo to feel comfortable with the new trainer, with the new coach coming in.\"",
      "Martino guided Inter Miami to the best regular season record in Major League Soccer history this season. He was hired in July 2023, right around the time that Messi debuted for the club and insisted Friday that he needs to leave for personal reasons.",
      "Inter Miami \u2014 which won the 2023 Leagues Cup and MLS Supporters Shield this season under Martino \u2014 was eliminated in the first round of this year\u2019s MLS Cup playoffs. The team's 2025 season starts with training camp in January.",
      "Martino also had deep ties to Messi before coming to Inter Miami; he coached the world's most decorated men's player and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner with Barcelona and Argentina\u2019s national team before reuniting with him in South Florida. Martino said Friday he decided just before the start of the playoffs that he would not be back with Inter Miami next season.",
      "\u201cNeedless to say, we\u2019ve enjoyed it a lot and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity, on behalf of my entire coaching staff, to have been able to work at this club,\u201d Martino said Friday in his farewell news conference. \u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s been very captivating being part of the change during this year and a half.\u201d",
      "Inter Miami was 26-9-12 in MLS regular season matches in the Martino era.",
      "The 40-year-old Mascherano also played for five seasons in the Premier League, most of that with Liverpool. He played in the World Cup four times for Argentina \u2014 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018.",
      "The new coach \u2014 Mascherano or anyone else \u2014 will have a very busy first year. Inter Miami has a preseason tour planned in 2025, plus a 34-match MLS regular season and will play in Leagues Cup, the CONCACAF Champions Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "\u201cThis is an extremely attractive position for a coach,\u201d Mas said.",
      "Messi \u2014 MLS' highest-paid player, someone who had a 2 1/2-year deal worth an estimated $150 million in total when he joined Inter Miami \u2014 is going into his final guaranteed season with the club. He has an option for 2026, the year that Inter Miami plans to finally move into its Freedom Park complex currently being built near Miami International Airport.",
      "\u201cLeo and I will sit and we'll discuss the future,\u201d Mas said. \u201cAs I've said before, and I will repeat it now, I fully expect that the opening of our new stadium in 2026 in Miami \u2014 and the opening of our '26 season, hopefully after a trophy-laden 2025 season \u2014 that Lionel Messi will be our No. 10.\u201d",

      "Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322 as New York reached the World Series for the first time since 2009, only to lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Soto batted .288 with 41 homers, 109 RBIs and 129 walks in his first season with the Yankees and finished third in MVP voting, also trailing Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt. Jr.",
      "A free agent at 26, Soto has met with the Yankees, Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox, and he plans to meet with the Philadelphia Phillies, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meetings have not been publicly announced.",
      "Negotiations are not likely to intensify until after Thanksgiving.",
      "Judge hasn\u2019t spoken with Soto since the World Series. Judge went through the free-agent experience after hitting an AL record 62 homers in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe best thing is to really give those guys space,\" Judge said. \"I talked to him all season and he knows how we feel about him and I think the most important thing is now let him do his thing with his family, pray about it, talk with people and come to the right decision for him and his family.\u201d",
      "Soto met with Yankees officials on Monday at a hotel in southern California, a group that included owner Hal Steinbrenner, team president Randy Levine, general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone and senior adviser for baseball operations Omar Minaya.",
      "\u201cWe had a good meeting. It was a very honest back-and-forth dialogue, a couple hours long,\u201d Steinbrenner said Wednesday.",
      "Asked how confident he was about keeping Soto, Steinbrenner said: \u201cNo idea. We\u2019ll be in the mix. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Soto and Judge filled the Nos. 2 and 3 slots in the Yankees batting order in a franchise-record 153 games, topping the 145 of Joe Dugan and Babe Ruth in 1923, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.",
      "\u201cI get to see a lot of pitches,\" Judge said. \"He's going to be a tough at-bat in front of me. He\u2019s going to wear down the pitcher right there in the first inning, within the first 15 pitches or so. Yeah, I think that was a big impact just having having a guy like that in front of you.",
      "\"If I could have eight Juan Sotos in the lineup with me, I would love that.\u201d",
      "After the World Series, Judge spent about a week in Tampa, Florida, where the Yankees hold spring training, and met with Steinbrenner.",
      "\u201cWe kind of just discussed a lot of things from Juan to other guys that are kind of out there that I think could definitely help this team,:\" Judge said. \"So I kind of just gave my input on a couple things.\u201d",
      "Judge said when he agreed to his big deal in late 2022, Steinbrenner wanted to have a deeper relationship. They've been meeting every week or two, and pitcher Gerrit Cole has developed a similar exchange with the owner.",
      "\u201cI think just having that relationship to where I can kind of communicate with him about what I\u2019m seeing, what I\u2019m feeling, what I see with the guys, what I see against other guys that we play against,\u201d Judge said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a cool part to where I think just the more communication you have from top to bottom, it just \u2014 it makes everybody better.\u201d",
      "Judge's contract is baseball's fourth largest behind the deals of the Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani ($700 million), the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout ($426.5 million) and the Dodgers' Mookie Betts ($365 million). Judge cited the example of teammate Giancarlo Stanton, whose $325 million deal was the highest when he joined the Yankees ahead of the 2018 season but now ranks tied for ninth.",
      "\u201cEven though he signed one of those \u2014 the first big mega-contracts back in Miami, once he came here he didn\u2019t care about the highest-paid guy. He just wanted good players around him,\u201d Judge said.",
      "In joining Mickey Mantle in 1956 as the Yankees' only unanimous MVPs, Judge credited his teammates.",
      "\u201cYou look at every single one of my teammates in that room and know that each and every single one of them impacted me in a way that put me in that position,\u201d Judge said. \u201cSo it\u2019s always going to be a team award in my book.\u201d",

      "A goal by Marta helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday\u2019s National Women\u2019s Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit",
      "With technical prowess and considerable style, Marta danced around two sliding defenders, outwitted a goalkeeper and calmly scored as another player rushed forward in desperation to stop her.",
      "It was more Marta Magic.",
      "That goal last weekend helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday's National Women's Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit.",
      "Barbra Banda also scored in the Pride's 3-2 semifinal victory over the Kansas City Current. While Banda has had an incredible first season with the Pride, captain Marta has been the talisman that has helped lead the team in its remarkable turnaround this year.",
      "The last time the Pride were in the NWSL playoffs was in 2017 \u2014 Marta's first year with the club. But this season they nearly went undefeated, going 23 games without a loss to start the season before losing 2-0 to the Portland Thorns with just two regular-season games left.",
      "\u201cI think because of the way that we did it, during this season, from beginning to now, it\u2019s something very special that I\u2019ve never had before with any other club that I\u2019ve played for,\" Marta said. \"Plus year by year, we see in America, strong competition. This is the best league in the world. And you never know what\u2019s going to happen, and it\u2019s hard to keep winning the games, being in the first place almost like the whole season. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really different and so special.\u201d",
      "Marta\u2019s goal was the latest gasp-inducing moment in a stellar career filled with them. Known by just her first name, the 38-year-old is a six-time FIFA world player of the year.",
      "\"Let's see if tomorrow I can do something similar \u2014 or even better,\" Marta said on Friday.",
      "Her teammate Kylie Strom chimed in: \u201cThat was the greatest goal I've ever witnessed, hands down.\"",
      "Appropriate. Earlier this year, FIFA announced that the best goal in women's soccer each year would earn the Marta Award. In a lighthearted moment the day before the title match, Marta was asked if she thought it was possible she might give the award to herself.",
      "\u201cYou guys need to decide, because who votes for the best goal in the year? It\u2019s you. It\u2019s the people in the public. So it should be really interesting, like Marta\u2019s Award goes to Marta!\u201d she said with a laugh.",
      "Marta has played in six World Cups for Brazil and played this summer in her sixth Olympics, winning a silver medal after falling in the final to the United States. She previously said this would be her final year with the national team.",
      "But since then Brazil was named the host of the 2027 Women's World Cup.",
      "\"I had a conversation with my coach, the national team coach, and I was really clear about playing in 2027. I told him it\u2019s not my goal anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m always available to help the national team. And if they think I still can do something during this preparation for the World Cup, yeah, I would be happy to help them.\"",
      "Marta's club career started in Brazil when she was just 16. She has also played in Sweden and in the U.S. professional women's leagues that came before the NWSL.",
      "With nine regular-season goals, Marta has had one of her best seasons since she joined the Pride.",
      "\u201cI can never pick a side, I never pick favorites \u2014 but I love to see this for Marta,\" U.S. coach Emma Hayes said. \u201cMarta is someone we all like, admire and are grateful for. And that goal was just like prime Marta at her best. And so grateful for and thankful for her that she got the opportunity with another game with her team.\u201d",
      "The Pride went 18-2-6 this season, clinching the NWSL Shield for the first trophy in club history. Orlando also set a record with 60 regular-season points to finish atop the standings.",
      "\u201cWe are sitting top of the table, but I think there still are a lot of doubters. I think there\u2019s people out there who say, maybe this was a one-off season,\u201d Strom said. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to prove them all wrong. So I think we do carry a bit of that underdog mentality still with us.\u201d",
      "The second-seeded Spirit advanced to the title match at Kansas City's CPKC Stadium last weekend on a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw against defending champions Gotham FC.",
      "The Spirit's roster includes Trinity Rodman, a standout forward who formed the so-called \u201cTriple Espresso\u201d trio with Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith for the United States at the Olympics.",

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy will miss Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers with a sore throwing shoulder, dealing another blow to the 49ers' playoff hopes.",
      "Purdy injured his right shoulder in last Sunday's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He underwent an MRI on Monday that showed no structural damage and the team initially thought he could play this week.",
      "But when Purdy's shoulder didn't feel right when he made a few warmup throws at practice Thursday, those plans changed.",
      "\u201cWe thought he just needed some rest and we really weren\u2019t concerned about him not being good this week,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday. \u201cBut when he started up Thursday, it just surprised him, surprised us how it felt. So we had to shut him down.\u201d",
      "Shanahan said the team doesn't believe the injury is a long-term concern but he is uncertain whether Purdy will need to miss any additional time.",
      "\u201cThe MRI doesn\u2019t look like that, so it should be all right,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cBut the way it responded this week, it\u2019s really up in the air for next week. We\u2019ll have to see on Monday.\u201d",
      "The 49ers also will be missing star defensive end Nick Bosa, who is out after leaving last week's game in the second half with injuries to his left hip and oblique. Left tackle Trent Williams is questionable with an ankle injury and will be a game-time decision.",
      "San Francisco struggled on defense without Bosa last week and now will go the entire game this week without two of the team's most important players.",
      "The Niners (5-5) are currently in a three-way tie for second in the NFC West, a game behind first-place Arizona, and have little margin for error if they want to get back to the playoffs after making it to the Super Bowl last season.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cWe knew there was a chance for Nick. I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we addressed all that today. We\u2019re going to have 48 guys in uniform. I know our guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We\u2019re missing two good players, definitely. But we got a lot of good players out there. So by no means do we not have a chance to win.\u201d",
      "This will be the first time Purdy has missed a start because of an injury since taking over as the 49ers\u2019 quarterback in December 2022. Brandon Allen will start in his place.",
      "Purdy has completed 66% of his passes this season for 2,613 yards, 13 TDs, eight interceptions and a 95.9 passer rating that is down significantly from his league-leading mark of 113 in 2023.",
      "Allen has been mostly a backup since being drafted by Jacksonville in 2016. Allen last started a game in Week 18 of the 2021 season for Cincinnati and has thrown just three passes the last three seasons \u2014 including none since joining San Francisco in 2023.",
      "Allen said he preparation hasn't changed this week with the exception of getting to work with the first-team receivers instead of running the scout team.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d he said. \u201cThe circumstances are what they are. But I think our team all year long we\u2019ve been kind of dealing with injuries here and there. It\u2019s been a big next-man-up mentality. It\u2019s definitely an opportunity for me to go out and play well and put our guys in a good position to win the game. Obviously, we want Brock back and healthy and all that. But for the time being, it is an opportunity for me.\u201d",

      "When he was picked by the Wallabies last month for their end-of-year European tour, the 26-year-old Potter said he had been given the nickname \u201cWizard\u201d by a teammate \u2014 in reference to the Harry Potter character in J.K. Rowling\u2019s fantasy novels. Rowling has said she wrote most of the Harry Potter books in Edinburgh.",

      "Potter is one of six changes to the team that started the 52-20 win over Wales last weekend, including captain Harry Wilson returning at No. 8 and Joseph Sua'ali'i \u2014 who switched from rugby league last month \u2014 is back at outside center for his second start for Australia.",
      "Sua'ali'i also started the 42-37 victory over England that kicked off the Wallabies' end-of-year European tour. It ends in Dublin with a test against Ireland, when Australia will be hoping to clinch a first Grand Slam since 1984.",

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe aerial imagery was crucial to identify this really distinctive pattern of zigzag linear canals\u201d running for several miles through wetlands, said study co-author Eleanor Harrison-Buck of the University of New Hampshire.",
      "The team then conducted digs in Belize's Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. The ancient fish canals, paired with holding ponds, were used to channel and catch freshwater species such as catfish.",
      "\u201cBarbed spearpoints\u201d found nearby may have been tied to sticks and used to spear fish, said study co-author Marieka Brouwer Burg of the University of Vermont.",
      "The canal networks were built as early as 4,000 years ago by semi-nomadic people in the Yucatan coastal plain. According to the study, the canals were used for around 1,000 years or longer, including during the \u201cformative\u201d period when the Maya began to settle in permanent farming villages and a distinctive culture started to emerge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see such large-scale modifications of the landscape so early \u2014 it shows people were already building things,\u201d said University of Pittsburgh archaeologist Claire Ebert, who was not involved in the study.",
      "At the height of Maya civilization, people in this region built temples, roads, pyramids and other monuments. They also developed complex systems of writing, mathematics and astronomy. Scientists know far more about this era because there are many more significant archaeological sites, said Ebert.",
      "But this new study reveals a link between the earlier people on the landscape and the later emergence of Maya culture. These ancient channels for catching fish may have played a role in helping later Maya pyramids rise above the Yucatan rainforest.",
      "\u201cThis shows continuity,\" said University of Pennsylvania archaeologist Jeremy Sabloff, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "On a practical level, the fish-trapping canals helped the early people in the region to diversify their diets and feed a growing population, building a foundation for later cultural heights.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",

      "LONDON -- Apple and Google aren't giving consumers a genuine choice of mobile web browsers, a British watchdog said Friday in a report that recommends they face an investigation under new U.K. digital rules taking effect next year.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority took aim at Apple, saying the iPhone maker's tactics hold back innovation by stopping rivals from giving users new features like faster webpage loading. Apple does this by restricting progressive web apps, which don't need to be downloaded from an app store and aren't subject to app store commissions, the report said.",
      "\u201cThis technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,\u201d the watchdog said in a provisional report on its investigation into mobile browsers that it opened after an initial study concluded that Apple and Google effectively have a chokehold on \u201cmobile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "The CMA's report also found that Apple and Google manipulate the choices given to mobile phone users to make their own browsers \u201cthe clearest or easiest option.\u201d",

      "Both companies said they will \u201cengage constructively\u201d with the CMA.",
      "Apple said it disagreed with the findings and said it was concerned that the recommendations would undermine user privacy and security.",

      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "People seeking to avoid chaos, noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the U.S. elections are noticing a different mood on the Bluesky social platform, where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls.",
      "The site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after Election Day, and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk\u2019s X and similar platforms.",
      "If you're tempted to check out the new space, here's a guide on how Bluesky works:",
      "Maybe you're not ready to commit to adding yet another social media account. No problem \u2014 you can still look around on Bluesky without signing up because all posts and profiles are public.",
      "You might get a sense of deja vu because the platform's look and feel are very similar to X. That should be no surprise because Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was an early Bluesky champion. (Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.)",
      "If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social.",
      "You can personalize your handle to make it more memorable, by using your own website's domain or buying a custom one through Bluesky. But it might not be something most newbie users need or want to do right away.",
      "Bluesky boasts that it gives users \u201calgorithmic choice\u201d to tailor the content they're shown instead of leaving it up to the whims of a centralized system.",
      "\u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,\u201d it says.",
      "What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button.",
      "There's also the usual \u201cDiscover\u201d feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow.",
      "To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don\u2019t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online.",
      "Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians. You can follow the whole pack or scroll down the list to choose individual accounts.",
      "What about people you followed on X? There's a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who've migrated to Bluesky. But check before clicking the follow button to make sure it's not a different user using the same display name or handle.",
      "Ready to join the conversation? You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there's a limit of 300 characters \u2014 20 more than on X. You can also upload photos and videos, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are, of course, available too.",

      "A Thai court has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a pro-democracy activist who alleged spyware produced by an Israeli tech firm had been used to hack his phone",
      "BANGKOK -- A Thai court on Thursday threw out a lawsuit brought by a pro-democracy activist which alleged spyware produced by an Israeli tech firm had been used to hack his phone.",
      "The Civil Court in Bangkok said Jatupat Boonpattararaksa had failed to provide sufficient proof that his phone was infected with Pegasus spyware produced by NSO Group Technologies.",
      "Jatupat, also known as Pai Dao Din, had alleged that the NSO Group had violated his and other activists' constitutional rights by facilitating the use of Pegasus to allegedly target them and extract data from their devices.",
      "He had claimed his phone was infected on three occasions in 2021, a time of large-scale protests against the government that included unprecedented demands for reform of Thailand\u2019s powerful but opaque monarchy.",
      "The NSO Group welcomed the ruling, saying it reaffirmed \u201cthe lack of evidence to support the claims against our company.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to the responsible use of our technologies, which are exclusively provided to government agencies for the prevention of serious crimes and terrorism,\u201d spokesperson Gil Lainer said in an email to The Associated Press. \"NSO operates under strict regulatory frameworks and ethical standards, and we will continue to cooperate with authorities to ensure our products are used lawfully and effectively.\u201d",
      "An investigation last year by Thai civil society group iLaw, Thai internet freedom organization DigitalReach and Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab found that 35 individuals in Thailand were targeted by government surveillance using Pegasus in 2020 and 2021. The victims were predominantly activists and scholars.",
      "Other activists alleged that Thai government agencies were behind the use of Pegasus, but officials have not commented directly on it. When pressed by the opposition in Parliament in 2022, the government acknowledged that state agencies had used Pegasus for activities related to \u201csecurity or narcotics.\u201d",
      "Speaking outside the court, Jatupat, who had been a leader of street protests in 2021, said he had brought the suit to fight for people's rights and freedoms.",
      "\u201cWe fought for this because we wanted to prove whom the law will protect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is obvious today that the court chose to protect state security.\u201d",
      "Sutawan Chanprasert from DigitalReach called the ruling \"disappointing.\"",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lesson learned,\u201d she said. \"I think the reason the court gave will help us to prepare better for future cases.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International, which had filed a brief in support of Jatupat's suit and has investigated the use of Pegasus spyware around the world, called the ruling \u201cdeeply alarming.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever it won\u2019t deter the fight against the unlawful use of spyware and the fight for justice for the victims of spyware in Thailand and around the world,\" the rights group said in a statement.",
      "NSO Group has previously said it only develops the spyware and does not control its use. Its products, including the Pegasus software, are typically licensed to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to investigate terrorism and serious crime, according to the company\u2019s website."

    "story": [
      "Nvidia has reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.",
      "For the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.",
      "Nvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.",
      "Wall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Investors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia\u2019s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.",
      "Analysts\u2019 were eyeing Nvidia\u2019s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.",
      "Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.",
      "On an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems \u201chave certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery customer is racing to be the first to market,\u201d Kress said. \u201cBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\u201d",
      "The company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver \u201cmore Blackwells than we had previously estimated\u201d this quarter, Huang added.",
      "Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "The company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang\u2019s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.",
      "Nvidia's fourth-quarter guidance was \u201ca little bit disappointing,\u201d said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had \u201ca tremendous quarter.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,\u201d Volpe said.",
      "Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion.",
      "Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows \u201cthe AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBlackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia's stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.\u201d",
      "Through the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is upon us,\" Huang said on the call. \"And it\u2019s large and diverse.\u201d"

      "Bitcoin is jumping again, setting another new high above $99,000",
      "NEW YORK -- Bitcoin extended its streak of record highs after ticking above $99,000 for the first time. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",
      "Now, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000, just two years after dropping below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The dramatic rally rolls on as industry players expect the incoming Trump administration to bring a more \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d approach toward regulating the digital currency.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at $99,526 Friday afternoon, according to CoinDesk.",
      "As with everything in the volatile crypto markets, the future is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But, chances are, you've heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but the large majority of daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Crypto industry players have welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, recently pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "How of this will actually pan out \u2014 and whether or not Trump will successfully act quickly on these promises \u2014 has yet to be seen.",
      "\u201cThis is not necessarily a short-term story, it\u2019s likely a much longer-term story,\" Citi macro strategist David Glass told The Associated Press last week. \"And there is the question of how quickly can U.S. crypto policy make a serious impact on (wider adoption).\u201d",
      "One step Trump must take in the short-term is name a new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares oversight of cryptocurrencies.",
      "Gary Gensler, current chair of the SEC, has led the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on crypto over recent years, penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. But he's also faced criticism from industry players in the process, like the chief legal officer of Robinhood, who described Gensler's approach toward crypto as \u201crigid\u201d and \"hostile.\u201d Gensler will step down in January when Trump takes office.",
      "Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, thinks the industry is craving \u201cjust some sort of clarity.\u201d Much of the approach to regulating crypto in the past has been \u201cenforcement based,\u201d he notes, which has been helpful in weeding out some bad actors \u2014 but legislation might fill in other key gaps.",
      "Despite crypto\u2019s recent excitement around Trump, McCarthy said that 2024 has already been a \u201chugely consequential year for regulation in the U.S.\u201d \u2014 pointing to January\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, which mark a new way to invest in the asset.",
      "Spot ETFs have been the dominant driver of bitcoin for some time now \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. According to Kaiko, bitcoin ETFs recorded $6 billion in trade volume for the week of the election alone.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. In theory, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term. Others note it may be too early to tell.",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. But experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. And lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could mean less guardrails.",
      "\u201cI would say, keep it simple. And don\u2019t take on more risk than you can afford to,\" McCarthy said \u2014 adding that there isn't a \u201cmagic eight ball\u201d to know for certain what comes next.",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\u201d which consumes a lot of energy. Operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections",

      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought",
      "NEW YORK -- Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought.",
      "Astronomers know that the universe is being pushed apart at an accelerating rate and they have puzzled for decades over what could possibly be speeding everything up. They theorize that a powerful, constant force is at play, one that fits nicely with the main mathematical model that describes how the universe behaves. But they can't see it and they don't know where it comes from, so they call it dark energy.",
      "It is so vast it is thought to make up nearly 70% of the universe \u2014 while ordinary matter like all the stars and planets and people make up just 5%.",
      "But findings published earlier this year by an international research collaboration of more than 900 scientists from around the globe yielded a major surprise. As the scientists analyzed how galaxies move they found that the force pushing or pulling them around did not seem to be constant. And the same group published a new, broader set of analyses Tuesday that yielded a similar answer.",
      "\u201cI did not think that such a result would happen in my lifetime,\u201d said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist at the University of Texas at Dallas who is part of the collaboration.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, it uses a telescope southwest of Tucson, Arizona to create a three-dimensional map of the universe over 11 billion years to see how galaxies have clustered throughout time and across space. That gives scientists information about how the universe evolved, and where it might be heading.",
      "The map they are building would not make sense if dark energy were a constant force, as it is theorized. Instead, the energy appears to be changing or weakening over time. If that is indeed the case, it would upend astronomers' standard cosmological model. It could mean that dark energy is very different than what scientists thought \u2014 or that there may be something else altogether going on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a time of great excitement, and also some head-scratching and confusion,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is not involved with the research.",
      "The collaboration's latest finding points to a possible explanation from an older theory: that across billions of years of cosmic history, the universe expanded and galaxies clustered as Einstein's general relativity predicted.",
      "The new findings aren't definitive. Astronomers say they need more data to overturn a theory that seemed to fit together so well. They hope observations from other telescopes and new analyses of the new data over the next few years will determine whether the current view of dark energy stands or falls.",
      "\u201cThe significance of this result right now is tantalizing,\u201d said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmouth College who is not involved with the research, \"but it's not like a gold-plated measurement.\"",
      "There\u2019s a lot riding on the answer. Because dark energy is the biggest component of the universe, its behavior determines the universe\u2019s fate, explained David Spergel, an astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation. If dark energy is constant, the universe will continue to expand, forever getting colder and emptier. If it\u2019s growing in strength, the universe will expand so speedily that it\u2019ll destroy itself in what astronomers call the Big Rip.",
      "\u201cNot to panic. If this is what\u2019s going on, it won\u2019t happen for billions of years,\" he said. \u201cBut we'd like to know about it.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 19, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 20, 2024 to correct the location of the telescope used by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. It is southwest of Tucson, Arizona, not in Tucson. It also corrects the description of the instrument's three-dimensional map of the universe. The telescope mapped how the universe evolved over 11 billion years, but the universe is about 13.7 billion years old.",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "A volcano on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwestern Iceland is spewing lava from a fissure in its seventh eruption since December",
      "GRINDAVIK, Iceland -- A volcano in southwestern Iceland that has roared back to life after eight centuries of silence has erupted for the seventh time since December, sending molten lava flowing towards the Blue Lagoon spa, a major tourist attraction.",
      "The eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. (2314 GMT) Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, according to Iceland\u2019s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity.",
      "Most of the previous eruptions have subsided within days.",
      "\u201cIn the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi Gu\u00f0mundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told national broadcaster RUV.",
      "While the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindav\u00edk, which was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.",
      "Around 50 houses were evacuated after the Civil Protection agency issued the alert, along with guests at the Blue Lagoon By Thursday afternoon lava had spread across parking lot of the geothermal spa, one of Iceland's biggest tourist attractions, consuming a service building.",
      "Lava also reached the pipeline that supplies the peninsula with hot water for heating, the meteorological office said, though the pipes were built to withstand lava flow.",
      "The repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindav\u00edk, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and had a population before the eruptions of 3,800, have damaged infrastructure and property, forcing many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety.",
      "\u201cGrindav\u00edk is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi said.",
      "Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

It also leads in publishing responsible AI research. It's no surprise that the home of commercial AI powerhouses such as Google and Meta, along with relative newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, has produced many notable AI models that have influenced how the technology is being developed and applied. The U.S. also gets some points for having a number of AI-related laws on the books, though Congress has yet to pass any broad AI regulations.",
      "China has requested far more patents than any other country regarding generative AI, the U.N. intellectual property agency said earlier this year. Stanford researchers counted that as one measure of China's strong growth in AI innovation but not enough to lead the pack. Still, the report says that \"China\u2019s focus on developing cutting-edge AI technologies and increasing its R&D investments has positioned it as a major AI powerhouse.\u201d China's universities have produced a large number of AI-related research publications and it has commercial leaders developing notable AI models, such as Baidu and its chatbot Ernie.",
      "Coming in at No. 3 is the UK, which also ranked high in research and development, and educational infrastructure due to top computer science universities churning out a skilled AI workforce. It's also home to Google's AI subsidiary DeepMind, whose co-founder recently won a Nobel Prize; and \u201chad more mentions of AI in parliamentary proceedings\u201d than any other country.

      "The UAE's deliberate focus on AI appears to have paid off in the Middle Eastern nation's fifth-place score. It was one of the top locations for AI investments. Microsoft earlier this year said it was investing $1.5 billion in UAE-based tech firm G42, which is overseen by the country\u2019s powerful national security adviser. Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers and has built what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 are France at No. 6, followed by South Korea, Germany, Japan and Singapore. France, home to the buzzy AI startup Mistral, ranked high in AI policy and governance. Both it and Germany are part of the European Union's sweeping new AI Act that places safeguards on a range of AI applications based on how risky they are.

Matt Gaetz does not intend to return to Congress after he withdrew from consideration to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, it appears his seat will be vacant for months -- presenting a challenge for House Republicans who already maintain a slim majority in the incoming Congress.",
      "On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis set the FL-01 special election primary for Jan. 28 and the general election for April 1. That means Gaetz's seat will be unfilled for at least 12 weeks in the 119th Congress.",
      "\"At Gov. Ron DeSantis' direction, this special election is being conducted as quickly as statutorily possible,\" said Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd on Friday. \"We are committed to ensuring this election is held as soon as we are allowed to hold it by state law.\"",

The numbers do not take into account any departures for jobs in the Trump administration or Gaetz's resignation. There are also three outstanding House races that still haven't been called, which will determine the ultimate size of the GOP's majority.",

      "The president-elect has made millions licensing his name and image for profit.",

      "As the former president prepares to return to the Oval Office, experts warned that the opaque structure of the companies that produce these items could create fresh conflicts of interest for Trump -- with few public details about who Trump is in business with and how much he profits.",
      "\"We've never seen a president merchandise like this,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group. \"Tracking partners is very difficult unless they come forward, and there's no way to know for sure.\"",
      "Compared to his $3 billion stake in his social media company and his multimillion-dollar buildings, Trump's licensing deals comprise only a fraction of his portfolio -- but his opaque deals can be ethical \"black boxes\" that escape outside scrutiny according to Libowitz.",
      "Without knowing who the president-elect is in business with, it's impossible to know if he might use the power of his office to help his bottom line or benefit his business partners or whoever is contributing money to him, Libowitz said.",
      "Trump has entered into the licensing agreements through two companies -- CIC Ventures LLC and CIC Digital LLC -- that are fully owned by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. According to a 2023 financial disclosure, Trump made more than $7 million though CIC Digital LLC, which entered a licensee agreement for the sale of nonfungible tokens or NFTs.",

Details about where the guitars are made and how much profit, if any, Trump makes from the sales, were not immediately available, and Trump Guitars did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Items like Trump sneakers and watches are distinct from the merchandise Trump sells through his campaign website, which offers everything from Make America Great Again hats to Christmas ornaments. The profit from those purchases goes toward Trump's joint fundraising committee, which is subject to rigorous reporting requirements for political contributions.",
      "But the external companies that Trump licenses to sell his other items aren't subject to oversight. It's an approach that Trump has taken for decades: Making money from his brand by selling everything from steaks to vodka with limited involvement, by outsourcing the design, production, and distribution of the goods under license to separate companies, about which little is often known.",
      "For someone in power, like the president, that arrangement can create \"areas of potential concern,\" according to Weissman.",
      "Details about the terms of Trump's agreements with the merchandise companies -- such as JBCZ Group LLC for his coins or TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC for his watches -- are not public, and the LLCs are registered in states that offer few details about the companies' ownership.",
      "Some of Trump's merchandise -- such as his NFTs or watches -- also sell for wildly high prices that create an avenue for individuals, including potentially foreign actors, to channel money to Trump, according to Libowitz. Trump Watches is currently offering a \"Trump Victory Tourbillon\" watch for $100,000.",
      "\"That kind of seems like it is a way to put money directly in his pockets,\" said Libowitz, who believes the watch is likely worth a fraction of its asking price. \"It's an opportunity to give money directly to him and let him know that.\"",
      "Trump Watches, Trump Coins, Trump Sneakers, and God Bless The USA Bible did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, and nor did a spokesperson for Trump's transition team.",
      "When Trump entered the White House in 2017, he resigned as the trustee of Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and passed control to his sons and a business partner to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The setup allowed Trump to still profit from his businesses while relinquishing control of day-to-day operations and decisions.",
      "While he regained control of the Trust when he left office in 2021, it's expected that he'll again hand over control when he returns to office in January -- although experts say the arrangement is unlikely to shed additional light on his licensing deals.",

      "Bondi was elected attorney general in 2010 and was reelected in 2014. She left the office after reaching her two-term limit in 2019.",
      "A year later, she was selected as part of Trump's defense team for his first impeachment trial. He was acquitted in the Senate.",
      "Bondi has also been a registered lobbyist since 2019 at Brian Ballard's firm, Ballard Partners. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, is also a lobbyist with the firm.",
      "Bondi\u2019s most recent clients include the Florida Sheriffs' Association, the Florida Sheriffs' Risk Management Fund and the Major County Sheriffs of America. Her quarterly retainer fees range from $20,000 to $50,000, federal lobbying disclosures show.",

She serves as AFPI's chair for the Center for Litigation, and co-chair of the Center for Law and Justice, according to the think tank's website.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:44:45 -0500",
    "summary": "RFK Jr.'s controversial views have received criticism since he was picked by Donald Trump to lead HHS -- but he's also receiving support from some unexpected sources.",
    "story": [
      "Michael Pollan praised his food stances but described him as a \"horrible\" pick.",
      "Since being tapped as President-elect Donald Trump's controversial pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been criticized by medical and public health experts for his anti-vaccine history, his current vaccine skepticism, his take on the COVID-19 pandemic -- and by some for his descriptions of fluorinated water. But some of the environmental attorney's views are also receiving support from some unexpected sources.",
      "On Wednesday, renowned food author Michael Pollan echoed those criticisms -- but offered some praise for Kennedy's criticism of the American food industry, which Kennedy has accused of propagating obesity and chronic disease.",
      "\"He's voicing a critique of the food system that is important,\" Pollan told ABC News, while making clear he was drawing a \"strong distinction\" between Kennedy's food stances and his medical advice -- and that he thinks Kennedy is a \"horrible\" choice for the job.",
      "Pollan's comments join a stance taken in recent days by some prominent Democrats who have praised Kennedy for his vows to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" in part by tackling the food industry -- while condemning him for his years working against vaccine health policies.",
      "The comments from Pollan to ABC News came after he shared a seemingly positive article on social media about Kennedy titled, \"They're lying about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" -- a move that prompted Kennedy himself to reply and suggest they work together.",
      "\"Thanks @michaelpollan!\" Kennedy wrote Thursday on X. \"I'd love to work with you to restore our public health agencies to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Asked if he would take Kennedy up on the offer, Pollan was clear: \"No.\"",
      "\"I've got my role to play, and that's not the role,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Kennedy has faced fierce criticism over his claims that vaccines are behind an \"epidemic\" of diseases in America, and that cavity-fighting mineral fluoride, added in small amounts to some drinking water, is \"industrial waste.\" Pollan said Kennedy's stances on vaccines and fluoride \"seem nutty\" and that he was overall a \"horrible\" pick to lead HHS.",
      "But Pollan -- who has authored multiple books, including several on the effects of food on the human body -- offered some praise for Kennedy for his views on ultra-processed food and the overuse of corn and soy.",
      "\"He's injected these issues into the national conversation, and I think that's a big deal,\" Pollan said.",
      "He also praised Kennedy for linking the epidemic of obesity and chronic disease to agricultural policies -- a move he said is \"really important.\"",
      "\"I'm looking for glimmers in an otherwise bleak landscape,\" Pollan said.",
      "Pollan's approval of Kennedy's food stances follows similar praise from some Democrat officials.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \"excited by the news\" that Kennedy had been appointed to lead HHS, writing on X that he was \"most optimistic\" about Kennedy \"taking on big pharma and the corporate ag oligopoly to improve our health.\"",
      "He wrote in a subsequent post that \"Science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation's health policy\" and said \"the science-backed decision to get vaccinated improves public health and safety,\" but noted that he is \"for a major shake-up in institutions like the FDA that have been barriers to lowering drug costs and promoting healthy food choices.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey posted a video on social media about how he has been \"raising the alarm of the dangers of our current food system.\"",
      "\"Food in America is making us sick,\" Booker said in the video. Though he did not mention Kennedy by name, Kennedy reposted the video, thanking Booker for his \"long history of leadership on this issue.\"",
      "Asked by ABC News, Booker said he had not yet made up his mind on Kennedy's nomination, saying that Kennedy would need to go through the confirmation process and that Kennedy's stances on vaccines were \"very troubling.\" He added he was \"super skeptical of the Trump administration's efforts in any way to say that they are going to be doing things to make us more healthy.\"",
      "Still, Booker added he was \"happy to hear\" Kennedy on some of the issues around health, saying, \"There's a growing coalition in America from both sides of the aisle really demanding change. I hope, if the Trump administration is willing to do something right and positive on these issues, I'll be right there.\"",
      "\"When it comes to RFK, we're going to look at the totality of his record, we're going to evaluate and make a decision, but my focus is trying to block Trump from doing more damage to Americans health, like he did last time,\" Booker said.",
      "Pollan, for his part, questioned just how much Trump would let Kennedy make true reforms to the food industry, should Kennedy be confirmed.",
      "\"I have my doubts about whether Trump is going to give him authority to do what he wants to do around food,\" Pollan said of Kennedy, who over the weekend was in a viral photo eating McDonald's with Trump and others on Trump's plane. \"Whether he'll get anywhere, I have my doubts -- but I am pleased to see these issues getting talked about.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former Trump Cabinet member, she railed against his choices for DNI, HHS.",
      "The sudden withdrawal of former Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for attorney general, amid opposition from Senate Republicans, marks the first major setback for Trump as he fills his Cabinet -- but other high-profile nominees also appear to be facing mounting pushback from members of his own party.",
      "In a recent episode of her SiriusXM radio show, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, skewered Tulsi Gabbard, the president-elect's selection for director of national intelligence, and his choice for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- blasting both nominees for their foreign policy ideologies.",
      "Speaking about Gabbard, Haley said she had \"major issues\" with her being proposed and reiterated comments Gabbard has made in the past that she said run counter to the views of the U.S. intelligence community, including blaming NATO for the invasion of Ukraine and her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017.",
      "\"She has defended Russia, she has defended Syria, she has defended Iran, and she has defended China,\" Haley said. \"DNI has to analyze real threats. Are we comfortable with someone like that at the top of our national intelligence agencies?\"",
      "In presenting her argument, Haley also emphasized various occasions in which Gabbard -- a former Democratic congresswoman who ran for the party's presidential nomination in 2020 before becoming a Republican -- has directly clashed with the president-elect.",
      "\"She opposed ending the Iran nuclear deal. She opposed sanctions on Iran. She opposed designating the Iran military as terrorists who say death to America every single day,\" Haley said. \"She said that Donald Trump turned the U.S. into Saudi Arabia's prostitute. This is going to be the future head of our national intelligence.\"",
      "Haley also referenced Gabbard's assertion in a 2020 interview that the Trump administration provided \"no justification whatsoever\" for authorizing the strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, which Gabbard also described at the time as an \"illegal and unconstitutional act of war.\"",
      "\"She tried to limit Trump's war powers against Iran. She tried to cut our annual defense budget so that we couldn't punish Iran and hinder their influence,\" Haley said.",
      "Speaking about Kennedy, Haley said he is \"not a health guy\" but a \"liberal Democrat\" who spent his time in Washington siding with progressive policies while also criticizing his views of U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"He said he would consider admitting Russia into NATO,\" Haley said, an apparent reference to Kennedy's contention that Moscow should have been admitted to the alliance following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",
      "Haley also denounced Kennedy's support for thawing relations with China, which she said could have deleterious implications for American healthcare.",
      "\"During COVID, we talked about how 90% of our medications were coming from China and how dependent we are. He wants us to deescalate tensions,\" she said.",
      "Haley was Trump's primary opponent in the content for the GOP's presidential nomination but endorsed him after dropping out of the race in March.",
      "After winning the White House, the president-elect publicly announced he would not invite Haley back to serve in his second administration. But Haley, at least outwardly, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump and brushed off the snub, insisting she made it clear she had \"no interest in being in his Cabinet.\"",
      "Sources tell ABC News that Gaetz bowed out of what was shaping up to be a futile confirmation battle on Thursday after it became clear to Trump's team that the former Florida lawmaker, who is facing sex trafficking and drug use allegations, had \"no path\" to securing 50 votes in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "While it's not clear that either Gabbard or Kennedy face similarly long odds in the chamber, both have been lambasted by Republicans in recent days.",
      "Former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh slammed both candidates during an interview on Sunday.",
      "\"These people have no business running these departments,\" he said. \"This is like a revenge against Dr. Fauci when it comes to RFK Jr., but Tulsi Gabbard, the best you can say about her is she's a Putin cheerleader. That's the best you can say.\"",
      "Gabbard has also attracted the ire of the \"Wall Street Journal's\" right-leaning editorial board, which said she has \"given no indication across her long political career that she is the right person\" to lead the intelligence community.",
      "The Trump-friendly New York Post took aim at both Gabbard and Kennedy, calling the former congresswoman a \"dreadful\" pick and saying \"it's hard to see\" how Kennedy could lead the Department of Health and Human Services to \"practical solutions.\"",
      "During the confirmation process, Republicans are expected to press Kennedy, who switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent in 2023, on a range of views \u2014 including his criticism of vaccines and history of supporting abortion rights.",
      "But another controversial nominee, Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News co-host whom Trump has tapped to lead the Pentagon, appears to be gaining GOP support.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said Hegseth would be a \"perfect\" secretary of defense.",
      "Hegseth has been accused of sexual assault in 2017, and new details about the allegation emerged on Wednesday when a police report on the incident was made public. He has denied all wrongdoing and was never charged with a crime.",
      "After Hegseth met with Republicans on Capitol Hill, several Republicans appeared poised to look past the accusations against him.",
      "\"Since no charges were brought by the authorities, we have only press reports,\" Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 10:11:57 -0500",
    "summary": "After offering the Trump administration land for \"deportation facilities,\" other parts of Texas near the border could be offered up, too, an official says.",
    "story": [
      "The official said the land could be used to build \"deportation facilities.\"",
      "A Texas official, who this week offered the incoming Trump administration a 1,402-acre plot of land to build \"deportation facilities,\" says other parts of Texas near the border could be offered up in a similar fashion.",
      "\"Absolutely -- I have 13 million acres, if any of them can be of help in this process, we're happy to have that discussion,\" Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham told ABC's Mireya Villarreal in an interview.",
      "The Texas General Land Office purchased the plot of land from a farmer in October originally to facilitate Texas' efforts to build a border wall. Together with this land, the state office owns about 4,000 acres in Starr County, about 35 miles from McAllen, Texas.",
      "\"My office is fully prepared to enter into an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or the United States Border Patrol to allow a facility to be built for the processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history,\" Buckingham wrote in a letter addressed to President-elect DonaldTrump, earlier this week.",
      "In an interview via Zoom, Buckingham claimed authorities were frequently \"getting reports from the community\" that crimes were happening on the property.",
      "\"There was a significant mass of humanity and terrible things happening on this property. We heard it again and again and again,\" she said.",
      "Buckingham placed the blame squarely on what she called the Biden administration's \"open border policies\" and said the county voted Republican for the first time in a century because residents there felt those policies are \"directly harming their communities\" and jeopardizing their safety.",
      "During the interview, Villarreal noted she had been speaking with residents and community leaders in the region who paint a different picture of the area, one of a safe community that does not have the violent crime that Buckingham has described.",
      "When asked by Villareal to provide details of where those crimes are occurring, Buckingham said most of the migrants are passing through and, using some of the same rhetoric about migrants and crime used by President-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail, said they \"unleash some of their violent criminal habits\" in other states across the country.",
      "\"Well, a lot of it is migrant-migrant crime, but you're right, the communities along the border are lovely,\" she said. \"The people who live there are lovely. Obviously, most of the migrants who come across aren't interested in sticking around too long. They go to other parts of the country, as we have seen in faraway states -- people who came across the Texas border -- and then tend to unleash some of their violent criminal habits in other states.\"",
      "She added, \"But the bottom line is, until we have complete operational control of the border, until we have these violent criminals off of our soil that continue to hurt our sons and daughters, we need to keep working on it and get it done.\"",
      "In 2023, in the same county where the Texas commission recently bought the 1,402-acre plot of land, the Biden administration announced it had authorized building about 20 miles of southern border wall using money that was already appropriated under the first Trump administration.",
      "President Joe Biden at the time claimed he had no choice to build the wall, which directly contradicted a promise he made during his 2020 presidential run.",
      "\"I tried to get them to reappropriate -- to redirect the money,\" Biden told reporters at the time. \"They didn't, they wouldn't. And in the meantime, there's nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what is appropriated. I can't stop that.\"",
      "After that announcement, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said there was an \"immediate need to construct physical barriers\" in the area.",
      "Buckingham said she's confident she'll hear back from the incoming Trump administration about her offer of land.",
      "\"We have heard through back channels that they're aware of our letter and they are definitely looking at it,\" she said.",
      "Incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan, in an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, indicated the incoming administration would be open to using the land Texas is offering.",
      "\"Absolutely we will,\" he said, adding that when they arrest a migrant, they'll need a place to detain them.",
      "Democratic governors of border states -- such as Arizona and California -- have said they will not aid the Trump administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs told ABC News Live earlier this week that she would not use state police or the National Guard to help with mass deportation.",

      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",

      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",

      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",

    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- JD Vance's election as vice president has opened up one of Ohio's U.S. Senate seats for the third time in as many years, setting off a scramble for the appointment among the state's ruling Republicans.",
      "GOP Gov. Mike DeWine is tasked with filling the vacancy, giving the pragmatic center-right politician a hand in setting his party's course in the state potentially for years to come. His decision will be made in the afterglow of sweeping wins by Republicans in November under the leadership of Donald Trump, but a poor choice could also help Democrats reclaim a place in Ohio\u2019s Senate delegation when the seat comes up for reelection in less than two years.",
      "\u201cLook, being a United States senator is a big deal,\u201d the governor told reporters in the days after the election. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for the state, and we need to get it right.\u201d",
      "DeWine has a long list to choose from \u2014 particularly given the number of GOP candidates who competed unsuccessfully in Senate primaries in 2022 and 2024. Those under consideration who previously lost crowded Republican primaries are former Ohio Republican Chair Jane Timken; two-term Secretary of State Frank LaRose; and state Sen. Matt Dolan, whose family owns baseball's Cleveland Guardians. Two-term Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican attorney and strategist Mehek Cooke, a frequent guest on Fox News, are also in the mix.",
      "One other prospective appointee \u2014 a 2024 presidential contender, Cincinnati pharmaceutical entrepreneur and Vance insider Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 pulled out of contention after accepting a position in the new Trump administration.",
      "While Vance's departure also offers DeWine an opportunity to alleviate a bottleneck at the top of Ohio Republicans' political pecking order, where Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Attorney General Dave Yost are preparing to face off for governor in 2026, that appears unlikely. Husted is well into building his campaign organization, and Yost has said he would decline the appointment if offered. DeWine \u2014 a 77-year-old former U.S. senator term-limited in 2026 \u2014 also has said he would not appoint himself.",
      "Meanwhile, ambitions for the seat among Republican members of Ohio\u2019s congressional delegation \u2014 which includes U.S. Reps. Jim Jordan, Mike Carey, David Joyce and Warren Davidson \u2014 are being tempered by the slim House majority their party scored in November. House vacancies necessarily take months to fill under Ohio\u2019s election protocols, likely a consideration for DeWine as Trump prepares to push early policy priorities through Congress.",
      "Under state law, whoever gets the appointment will serve from the date of Vance's resignation, which he hasn't announced, until Dec. 15, 2026. A special election for the last two years of his six-year term would be held in November 2026.",
      "That special election could provide a comeback opportunity for Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who was unseated earlier this month by Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno. Though he wasn't specific, Brown told Politico last week: \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in this arena. I\u2019m not going away.\u201d Former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic Senate nominee who lost to Vance in 2022, could make another run, too. And Allison Russo, the Democratic leader of the Ohio House, also has been mentioned as a 2026 Senate contender.",
      "DeWine has made clear that he wants the Republican he chooses to be well positioned to defeat the Democrats in 2026. Their strengths as a statewide candidate and fundraiser are particularly important because Ohio's statewide elections also take place that year \u2014 and every seat is open. A strong incumbent senator at the top of that ticket could be valuable to returning Republicans to the offices of governor, attorney general, treasurer, auditor and secretary of state.",
      "Stamina also could be a factor. Timken ran for Senate most recently in 2022, LaRose ran this year, and Dolan ran both times. A win in 2026 would only give the victor a two-year reprieve before having to face Ohio voters again in 2028.",
      "\u201cThis is not for the faint-hearted,\u201d DeWine said.",
      "Dolan, who along with Timken is a millionaire, is rare among Republicans competing for the Vance appointment in not having ever won Trump's backing.",
      "In both 2022 and 2024, Dolan ran in Republicans' moderate lane, declining to align with Trump and disavowing his false claims that voter fraud lost him the 2020 election. Those stances won him DeWine's endorsement in last year's Senate primary, which could be a good sign for the term-limited Ohio Senate Finance chairman.",
      "The president-elect backed Vance in 2022 and Moreno this year \u2014 lifting both to victory. Moreno won a three-way Republican primary against Dolan and LaRose, while Vance topped a field of seven, before both went on to defeat Democratic opponents in now reliably red Ohio.",
      "In the state Legislature, Dolan opposed Ohio's now-blocked ban on abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected and an unsuccessful effort to override then-Gov. John Kasich's veto. Both LaRose and Sprague, then a state senator and representative, respectively, supported both the bill and the override effort.",
      "Timken, a Trump loyalist, has never held public office, but as a Senate candidate she described herself as \u201ca powerful ally for the pro-life movement\u201d and supported overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "Former U.S. Sen. Rob Portman backed Timken in the 2022 Senate primary, calling the Harvard-educated attorney and wife of former TimkenSteel CEO Tim Timken a smart, hard-working conservative.",
      "Some believe DeWine's penchant for elevating women could give her or Cooke an edge in the competition. Both his chief of staff and communications director are women and more than half of his Cabinet is female.",
      "Though Trump endorsed Vance over Timken for Senate in 2022, he had earlier hand-selected her to lead the Ohio Republican Party after his first election in 2016, and he has since supported her election as RNC National Committeewoman for Ohio.",
      "While Trump also passed over LaRose for a Senate endorsement this year, he had backed both him and Sprague in bids for statewide office \u2014 and both have endorsed him back.",
      "Both have twice won statewide races, though LaRose's high profile as Ohio's elections chief keeps him in the headlines more than Sprague, and he would be the first Green Beret to serve in the Senate. At the same time, the absence of controversy that has marked Sprague's tenure at the state treasury could make him less likely than LaRose to draw a primary challenger.",
      "DeWine says he wants his appointee to be focused on both state and national issues and willing to work hard and \u201cget things done.\u201d He also hinted that the person\u2019s politics can\u2019t be too extreme.",
      "\u201cIt also has to be someone who can win a primary, it has to be someone who can win a general election, and then two years later do all that again,\" he said.",

      "A Tennessee man who helped two hired killers after they gunned down rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery three years ago has been sentenced to six years probation",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who helped two hired killers after they gunned down rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery will not serve time in prison under a sentence of six years' probation, a judge ruled Friday.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson, 27, pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the shooting. Johnson helped Cornelius Smith Jr. and Justin Johnson, his half-brother, communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities after the daytime ambush.",
      "Justin Johnson was convicted on Sept. 26 of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 35 years. Smith has been charged with first-degree murder and he testified at Justin Johnson's trial, saying they fatally shot Young Dolph.",
      "Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell sentenced Jermarcus Johnson to a six-year diversionary program where he will undergo job training, submit to drug testing, refrain from possessing a gun and serve 20 hours of community service per year. His record could be cleared if he successfully completes the program.",
      "Speaking with reporters after the sentencing, prosecutor Paul Hagerman noted that Jermarcus Johnson had no role in the actual killing of Young Dolph.",
      "\u201cHe was used by his brother,\u201d Hagerman said. \"He is not a criminal.\"",
      "Young Dolph, whose real name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was fatally shot in November 2021 at a bakery located near the house where he grew up. Known for charitable works in Memphis, the 36-year-old rapper and independent music label owner was in the city to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an event that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Justin Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of his artists were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "Hagerman, the prosecutor, told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cnumber two person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "During the hearing where he pleaded guilty, Jermarcus Johnson acknowledged taking possession of a cellphone and car from Justin Johnson. Jermarcus Johnson also identified a photo in which Justin Johnson was wearing the same clothing as one of the two shooters.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson also testified during his half-brother's trial. His lawyer, Josh Corman, said Friday that Jermarcus Johnson \u201cwas put in a bad situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all think it's a fair resolution,\u201d Corman said.",
      "Another man, Hernandez Govan, whom Smith identified as a go-between with Big Jook, has pleaded not guilty to organizing the killing. Govan\u2019s trial has been set for March 10.",
      "Right after the shooting, Makeda's Homemade Cookies turned into a makeshift memorial for Young Dolph, with fans praying in the parking lot and writing messages of condolences and love on plywood covering the shot-out windows. The bakery closed for months but has since reopened.",
      "He also was honored by the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA during a game. Murals of the rapper were painted around the city. A neighborhood street was named after him.",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \u201cKing of Memphis.\u201d He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others.",
      "Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020's \u201cRich Slave\u201d peaking at No. 4."

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors in New York dropped charges Friday against a kaffiyeh-wearing, pro-Palestinian protester who was among the first people arrested under a local face mask ban that's stirred free speech concerns.",
      "Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly\u2019s office confirmed it moved to dismiss the charges against Xavier Roa during a court hearing on Long Island.",
      "\u201cThe case was investigated extensively and upon conclusion NCDA determined that the allegations could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and moved to dismiss the charges,\u201d spokesperson Nicole Turso said in a statement.",
      "Roa\u2019s lawyer Geoffrey Stewart hailed the decision as a \u201cbig victory\u201d for his client and \u201cfor civil liberties,\" but argued the law itself \u201cshould be struck from the books.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis case shows that the law can, and in all likelihood will be abused by law enforcement because the law is unconstitutionally vague,\u201d he said in an email.",

      "The North Bellmore resident was detained under Nassau County's Mask Transparency Act, which bans people from wearing masks to conceal their identity in public. It includes exemptions for people who wear masks \u201cfor health, safety, religious or cultural purposes.\"",
      "The county\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature approved the law in August in response to \u201cantisemitic incidents, often perpetrated by those in masks\u201d since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last year.",
      "Roa, who faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor charge, was the first protester arrested under the ban.",
      "The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and other groups denounced it at the time as proof that the local law was being used as a \u201csilencing tactic\u201d against Palestinian supporters.",
      "Nassau County police said Roa had been attempting to conceal his identity as he led others in pro-Palestinian chants. They also said he told officers he was wearing the scarf in solidarity with Palestinians and not for exempted medical or religious purposes.",
      "In videos showing some of the arrest, Roa wears the kaffiyeh around his neck as he\u2019s led away in handcuffs.",

      "The vote is being taken by employees of ABM and Prospect Airport Services, which provide services like cleaning interiors of the planes, removing trash and escorting passengers in wheelchairs.",
      "Charlotte Douglas International Airport said in a news release they were expecting approximately 1.02 million passengers departing between the Thursday and Monday before the holiday. The exact date of the proposed strike has not been announced.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:02:19 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Less is known about Trump's pick for the Atlanta-based CDC, which develops vaccines and monitors for infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "Weldon is a staunch, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican. Legislation he introduced more than 20 years ago outlawed human cloning. He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",
      "Weldon's nomination is likely to placate some anti-abortion advocates, who have been concerned about Trump's nomination of Kennedy, a longtime Democrat and proponent of abortion rights, as the nation's top health official.",
      "Weldon retired from his congressional seat in 2008, after 14 years in public office. Earlier this year, he lost in a GOP primary for a seat in the Florida Legislature.",
      "If he's confirmed, he'll be in charge of more than 13,000 employees and nearly 13,000 other contract workers.",
      "Nesheiwat, meanwhile, will oversee 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members if the Republican-controlled Senate approves her nomination as the surgeon general. She is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York. She appears regularly on Fox News and has expressed frequent support for Trump, sharing photos of them together on her social media pages.",
      "Surgeons general also have the power to issue advisories, warning of public health threats in the U.S. Those advisories can influence how the government, public and medical community respond to health crises in the country.",

      "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey has announced that the state's reliance on hotels and motels to shelter homeless people will be phased out in the next couple of years",
      "BOSTON -- Massachusetts' reliance on hotels and motels to shelter homeless people will be phased out in the next couple of years, Gov. Maura Healey said Friday, outlining changes to the state's emergency family shelter system.",
      "The Democratic governor said the changes would help more families find stable, permanent housing and help manage costs. Healey said the emergency assistance system has remained steady at around 7,500 families with up to 40 families initially seeking shelter per day. In recent months, that average has fallen to about 15-18 families per day, she said.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, the state\u2019s family shelter system has grown to be increasingly unsustainable,\" Healey said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken significant action to rein in its growth, and we\u2019ve seen tangible results.\u201d",
      "Last year, Healey declared a state of emergency, capping shelter capacity at 7,500 families. The state has also barred homeless families from sleeping overnight at Logan International Airport in Boston.",
      "Healey said the state will be phasing out the use of hotels and motels to shelter homeless people during the 2025 and 2026 fiscal years. The facilities lack the space for services and can be isolating, Healey said. She said providers will work with families to find safe and stable housing.",
      "The administration will also push to increase the state's temporary rental subsidy, Healey said. Under the proposed change, families will be eligible for up to $25,000 of rental assistance per year for two years. The current benefit is a total of $30,000 over two or $45,000 over three years.",
      "Beginning Dec. 10, homeless families will be placed on either a \u201cRapid Shelter Track\u201d or \u201cBridge Shelter Track\u201d depending on their needs, Healey said.",
      "The Rapid Shelter Track is aimed at families who have the resources to quickly find permanent housing. They will be offered 30 days of support to receive help with transitioning quickly to stable housing.",
      "The Bridge Shelter Track is meant for families with more complex needs who may take longer to find permanent housing \u2013 including women with late-term pregnancies and people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.",
      "Gladys Vega, president of La Colaborativa, an immigrant aid organization in Chelsea, Massachusetts, said it\u2019s critical to maintain a safety net for those struggling to find housing they can afford.",
      "\u201cAs rental prices continue to rise, families across the commonwealth are increasingly finding themselves unable to sustain the cost of housing,\u201d Vega said. \u201cMany Massachusetts residents are a single paycheck away from homelessness.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts has struggled to deal with a spike in demand for homeless services \u2014 in part due to the influx of migrants to the state.",
      "In June, Healey announced that beginning Aug. 1, families not prioritized for placement in emergency assistance shelters would be eligible to stay at overflow sites for just five days.",
      "Healey said she was tightening restrictions on emergency assistance system eligibility because of the system\u2019s \u201ccontinuing capacity constraints\u201d and the need to protect its financial sustainability",
      "Beginning June 1, the state also began limiting how long homeless families can stay in shelters to nine months. After that, families are eligible for up to two 90-day extensions."

      "A jury has convicted two men of charges related to human smuggling for their roles in an international operation that led to the deaths of a family of Indian migrants who froze while trying to cross the Canada-U.S. border during a 2022 blizzard",
      "FERGUS FALLS, Minn. -- A jury convicted two men on Friday of charges related to human smuggling for their roles in an international operation that led to the deaths of a family of Indian migrants who froze while trying to cross the Canada-U.S. border during a 2022 blizzard.",
      "Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, an Indian national who prosecutors say went by the alias \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d and Steve Shand, 50, an American from Florida, were part of a sophisticated illegal operation that has brought increasing numbers of Indians into the U.S., prosecutors said.",
      "They were each convicted on four counts related to human smuggling, including conspiracy to bring migrants into the country illegally.",
      "\u201cThis trial exposed the unthinkable cruelty of human smuggling and of those criminal organizations that value profit and greed over humanity,\u201d Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said.",
      "\u201cTo earn a few thousand dollars, these traffickers put men, women and children in extraordinary peril leading to the horrific and tragic deaths of an entire family. Because of this unimaginable greed, a father, a mother and two children froze to death in sub-zero temperatures on the Minnesota-Canadian border,\u201d Luger added.",
      "The most serious counts carry maximum sentences of up to 20 years in prison, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office told The Associated Press before the trial. But federal sentencing guidelines rely on complicated formulas. Luger said Friday that various factors will be considered in determining what sentences prosecutors will recommend.",
      "Federal prosecutors said 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik, froze to death Jan. 19, 2022, while trying to cross the border into Minnesota in a scheme Patel and Shand organized. Patel is a common Indian surname, and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel.",
      "The couple were schoolteachers, local news reports said. The family was fairly well off by local standards, living in a well-kept, two-story house with a front patio and a wide veranda.",
      "Experts say illegal immigration from India is driven by everything from political repression to a dysfunctional American immigration system that can take years, if not decades, to navigate legally. Much is rooted in economics and how even low-wage jobs in the West can ignite hopes for a better life.",
      "Before the jury\u2019s conviction on Friday, the federal trial in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, saw testimony from an alleged participant in the smuggling ring, a survivor of the treacherous journey across the northern border, border patrol agents and forensic experts.",
      "Defense attorneys were pitted against each other, with Shand\u2019s team arguing that he was unwittingly roped into the scheme by Patel.",
      "Patel\u2019s lawyers, The Canadian Press reported, said their client had been misidentified. They said \u201cDirty Hary,\u201d the alleged nickname for Patel found in Shand\u2019s phone, is a different person. Bank records and witness testimony from those who encountered Shand near the border didn\u2019t tie him to the crime, they added.",
      "Prosecutors said Patel coordinated the operation while Shand was a driver. Shand was to pick up 11 Indian migrants on the Minnesota side of the border, prosecutors said. Only seven survived the foot crossing. Canadian authorities found the Patel family later that morning, dead from the cold.",
      "The trial included an inside account of how the international smuggling ring allegedly works and who it targets.",
      "Rajinder Singh, 51, testified that he made over $400,000 smuggling over 500 people through the same network that included Patel and Shand. Singh said most of the people he smuggled came from Gujarat state. He said the migrants would often pay smugglers about $100,000 to get them from India to the U.S., where they would work to pay off their debts at low-wage jobs in cities around the country. Singh said the smugglers would run their finances through \u201chawala,\u201d an informal money transfer system that relies on trust.",
      "The pipeline of illegal immigration from India has long existed but has increased sharply along the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending Sept. 30, which amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago.",
      "By 2022, the Pew Research Center estimates more than 725,000 Indians were living illegally in the U.S., behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans.",
      "Jamie Holt, a Special Agent with Homeland Security Investigations, said the case is a stark reminder of the realities victims of human smuggling face.",
      "\u201cHuman smuggling is a vile crime that preys on the most vulnerable, exploiting their desperation and dreams for a better life,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThe suffering endured by this family is unimaginable and it is our duty to ensure that such atrocities are met with the full force of the law.\u201d",
      "One juror Kevin Paul, of Clearwater, Minnesota, told reporters afterward that it was hard for the jurors to see the pictures of the family\u2019s bodies. He said he grew up in North Dakota and is familiar with the kind of conditions that led to their deaths.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty brutal,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine having to do what they had to do out there in the middle of nowhere.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors\u2019 lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors\u2019 lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.",
      "The justices heard arguments in November in Meta's bid to shut down the lawsuit. On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.",
      "The high court dismissed the company\u2019s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.",
      "Investors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users\u2019 personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump \u2019s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Inadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company\u2019s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.",
      "Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court's action. \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,\u201d Stone said in an emailed statement.",
      "Meta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.",
      "Cambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.",
      "The lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against Nvidia. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency."

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he'll nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary, one of several personnel decisions that he unveiled as he closed out the workweek.",
      "Trump also said he would nominate Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget, the same position he held during Trump's first presidency. Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump's second term that the GOP nominee tried to distance himself from during the campaign.",
      "The announcements showed how Trump was trying to balance competing perspectives as he pursues an aggressive and sometimes contradictory economic agenda that includes cutting taxes, reducing government spending, putting tariffs on foreign imports and lowering prices for American consumers.",
      "Although Bessent is closely aligned with Wall Street and could earn bipartisan support, Vought is known as a Republican hardliner on budget and cultural issues.",
      "Trump said Bessent would \u201chelp me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States,\" while Vought \u201cknows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government.\u201d",
      "After announcing his choices for key financial posts, Trump kept up the pace of what has been a breakneck transition process.",
      "Trump picked Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, a rare Republican who is considered a stalwart union ally, as his labor secretary. He also said he would nominate Scott Turner, a former football player who worked in Trump's first administration, to serve as his housing secretary.",
      "More choices were named for health and national security positions. In less than three weeks since the election, Trump has announced decisions for almost his entire Cabinet.",
      "Bessent, 62, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation\u2019s first openly gay treasury secretary.",
      "He told Bloomberg in August that attacking the U.S. national debt should be a priority, which includes slashing government programs and other spending.",
      "\u201cThis election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,\u201d he said then.",
      "As of Nov. 8, the national debt stands at $35.94 trillion, with both the Trump and Biden administrations having added to it. Trump\u2019s policies added $8.4 trillion to the national debt, while the Biden administration increased the national debt by $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog.",
      "Even as he pushes to lower the national debt by stopping spending, Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from different economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years. Nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore\u2019s presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. Bessent had an influential role in Soros\u2019 London operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on \u201cBlack Wednesday,\u201d when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.",
      "Bessent previously told Bloomberg that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\u201d and he said tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives,\" such as encouraging allies to spend more on defense or deterring military aggression.",
      "In addition, Bessent has floated ideas for how Trump could put pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Last month, Bessent suggested Trump could name a replacement chair early, and let that person function as a \u201cshadow\u201d chair, with the goal of essentially sidelining Powell.",
      "But after the election, Bessent reportedly backed away from that plan. Powell, for his part, has said he wouldn\u2019t step down if Trump asked him to do so, and added that Trump, as president, wouldn't have the authority to fire him.",
      "Trump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term as president for raising the Fed\u2019s key rate in 2017 and 2018. During the 2024 campaign, he said that as president he should have a \u201csay\u201d in the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions. Presidents traditionally avoid commenting on the Fed\u2019s policies.",
      "Vought, 48, was the head of the Office of Management and Budget from mid-2020 to the end of Trump\u2019s first term in 2021, having previously served as the acting director and deputy director. He's paired a deep knowledge of government finances with his own Christian faith.",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as renewing \"a consensus of America as a nation under God.\u201d",
      "The Center for Renewing America released its own 2023 budget proposal entitled \u201cA Commitment to End Woke and Weaponized Government.\u201d The proposal envisioned $11.3 trillion worth of spending reductions over 10 years and about $2 trillion in income tax cuts in order to bring the budget into surplus by 2032.",
      "\u201cThe immediate threat facing the nation is the fact that the people no longer govern the country; instead, the government itself is increasingly weaponized against the people it is meant to serve,\u201d Vought wrote in the introduction.",
      "Vought\u2019s proposed budget plan would cut spending on food aid through the Agriculture Department. There would be $3.3 trillion in spending reductions in the Health and Human Services Department in large part through how Medicaid and Medicare funds are distributed. It also contains about $642 billion in cuts to Affordable Care Act. The budgets for the Housing and Urban Development and Education departments would also be cut.",
      "Vought\u2019s budget ideas were independent of Trump, who has not entirely spelled out the details of his economic plans.",
      "Trump's choice for labor secretary, Chavez-DeRemer, 56, narrowly lost her reelection bid earlier this month. She received strong backing from union members in her district.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer is one of a few House Republicans to endorse the \u201cProtecting the Right to Organize\u201d or PRO Act that would allow more workers to conduct organizing campaigns and would add penalties for companies that violate workers\u2019 rights. The act would also weaken \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that allow employees in more than half the states to avoid participating in or paying dues to unions that represent workers at their places of employment.",
      "Trump said in a statement that she would help \u201censure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success.\u201d",
      "In addition, Trump added to his health team on Friday evening. He chose Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a general practitioner and Fox News contributor, to be surgeon general; Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Republican congressman from Florida, to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, as head of the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Trump previously said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime spreader of conspiracy theories about vaccines, as health secretary.",
      "Alex Wong was named as principal deputy national security adviser, while Sebastian Gorka will serve as senior director for counterterrorism. Wong worked on issues involving Asia during Trump\u2019s first term, and Gorka is a conservative commentator who spent less than a year in Trump\u2019s first White House."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Daniel Penny chose not to testify and defense lawyers rested their case Friday at his trial in the death of an agitated man he choked on a subway train.",
      "Closing arguments are expected after Thanksgiving in the closely watched manslaughter case about the death of Jordan Neely, 30.",
      "The encounter between Penny, a white Marine veteran, and Neely, a homeless Black man with mental health and drug problems, has been drawn into U.S. political divides over race, public safety and cities\u2019 ability to handle mental illness and social ills.",
      "Penny, 26, has pleaded not guilty. Many criminal defendants don't take the stand, and juries are routinely instructed that they cannot hold defendants' silence \u2014 a constitutional right \u2014 against them.",
      "One of Penny\u2019s lawyers, Daniel Kenniff, noted after court that jurors did hear from Penny, in the form of his recorded statements to police minutes and hours after he put Neely in a chokehold.",
      "\u201cVirtually everything he said then is consistent with credible testimony of his fellow passengers,\" Kenniff said.",
      "Penny told police that he wrapped his arm around Neely's neck, took him to the floor and \u201cput him out\u201d because he was angrily throwing things and making threatening comments. Penny said on police video that he hadn't wanted to injure Neely but rather to keep him from hurting anyone else.",
      "A number of other passengers testified that they were scared of Neely and relieved that Penny grabbed hold of him.",
      "A man who later stepped in and held down Neely's arms, however, told jurors that he urged Penny to let go but that the veteran kept choking Neely for a time.",
      "Prosecutors say Penny meant to protect people but recklessly used too much force, overlooking Neely's humanity and making no effort to spare his life.",
      "City medical examiners ruled that the chokehold killed Neely. A pathologist hired by Penny's defense disputed that finding.",
      "Prosecutors, defense lawyers and the judge are set to meet Monday to hash out jury instructions."

      "An animal control officer shot and killed a pet dog in a Massachusetts town after mistaking it for a coyote in an incident that has the animal's owner fuming, but that local police are describing as a sad mix-up.",
      "The shooting happened on Tuesday after police received a call of a report of a coyote in a residential backyard, said Timothy Labrie, chief of police in Northbridge, Massachusetts. The animal control officer went into the woods to look for the coyote and found what they thought was the animal in a threatening position and shot it, he said.",
      "The officer then further examined the animal and saw that it had a flea collar and was a pet dog and not a coyote, Labrie said. Authorities then located the dog's owner, he said.",
      "The dog's owner, Kirk Rumford of Northbridge, said the dog was a husky named Odin that was less than a year old. Rumford said he felt non-lethal methods could have been used, and that his dog doesn't resemble a coyote.",
      "\u201cMy dog would have been the most gorgeous coyote ever, on steroids,\u201d Rumford said. \u201cIt's huge compared to that. Look at pictures of what a coyote looks like in Massachusetts and my dog. My dog was beautiful. He looked like a wolf if anything, and there are no wolves in Massachusetts.\u201d",
      "Rumford said he has received an outpouring of support from the community, and he hopes his story will help prevent further encounters between dogs and authorities. He described Odin as \u201ca knucklehead\u201d and a \u201cloveable klutz\u201d who had a loving disposition and loved to play with other dogs.",
      "Labrie said it was reasonable for the animal control officer to mistake the dog for a coyote, and the officer will not be disciplined. Dog owners can prevent these kind of mix-ups by keeping their dogs secure, Labrie said.",
      "\u201cWe do have leash laws. At the end of the day if you can keep your fenced-in areas secure, keep an eye on your dog, do whatever methods that you can use to keep your dog in your yard,\u201d Labrie said. \u201cAnd also if your dog tends to wander in the woods, I would definitely have identifying markers on them.\u201d",
      "The shooting happened as communities around Massachusetts and elsewhere in the country have seen an uptick in interactions between people and coyotes. One town, Nahant, moved to become the first in the state to contract with the federal government to kill coyotes after residents said the animals killed pets and posed a dangerous nuisance.",
      "Some scientists have said coyotes in the Eastern states have begun displaying increasingly wolflike traits as they have carved out a position near the top of the food chain. They are also hard to control.",
      "Remington Moll, an assistant professor of natural resources at University of New Hampshire, led a study published in Ecography this month that said it is possible hunting coyotes doesn't decrease their abundance, and can actually play a role in increasing it.",
      "\u201cIntensive coyote removal can obviously reduce populations in the short-term, but removal can also result in younger coyote populations with higher reproduction and immigration rates,\u201d Moll said in a statement.",
      "Northbridge, a town of about 16,000 people about 43 miles west of Boston, has had its share of interactions between people and coyotes, Labrie said. The animal control officer who shot the dog was a veteran officer who has had many encounters with coyotes over the years, Labrie said.",
      "\u201cWe've definitely seen a little bit of an uptick in coyote calls,\u201d Labrie said. \u201cWhat's causing it, I don't know.\u201d"

      "Texas\u2019 education board has voted to allow Bible-infused teachings in elementary schools",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas\u2019 education board voted Friday to allow Bible-infused teachings in elementary schools under optional new curriculum that could test boundaries between religion and public classrooms in the U.S.",
      "The material adopted by the Texas State Board of Education, which is controlled by elected Republicans, passed in a 8-7 final vote over criticism that the lessons would proselytize to young learners and alienate students of faiths other than Christianity. Supporters argued the Bible is a core feature of American history and that teaching it will enrich lessons.",
      "The vote allows schools in Texas, which has more than 5 million public school students, to begin using the material in kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms as early as next year.",
      "Republican lawmakers celebrated the vote, including Texas' powerful lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, who has pledged to pass legislation next year that would follow Louisiana in trying to require schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Greg Abbott called the vote \u201ca critical step forward to bring students back to the basics of education and provide the best education in the nation.\u201d",
      "Schools are not required to use the material, but those that do would receive extra funding from the state.",
      "In the newly approved kindergarten materials, one lesson on helping one\u2019s neighbor instructs teachers to talk about the Golden Rule using lessons from the Bible. It also instructs the teachers to explain that the Bible is \u201ca collection of ancient texts\u201d and that its different parts are \u201cthe core books of the Jewish and Christian religions.\u201d",
      "In a third-grade lesson about the first Thanksgiving, the material directs teachers to discuss how the governor of Plymouth said a prayer and gave a speech that included references to \u201cseveral passages from the Christian Bible in the book of Psalms.\u201d Teachers are then instructed to tell students the book of Psalms is a collection of songs, poems and hymns \u201cthat are used in both Jewish and Christian worship.\u201d",
      "With the new curriculum, Texas would be the first state to introduce Bible lessons in schools in this manner, according to Matthew Patrick Shaw, an assistant professor of public policy and education at Vanderbilt University. Whether the lesson plans will be considered constitutional is up in the air, he said.",
      "The Texas Education Agency, which oversees public education for more than 5 million students statewide, created its own instruction materials after a law passed in 2023 by the GOP-controlled Legislature required the agency to do so. The lesson plans were publicly released this spring.",
      "\u201cThis curriculum is not age-appropriate or subject matter appropriate in the way that it presents these Bible stories,\u201d said Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty.",
      "Children who would read the material, she said, \u201care simply too young to tell the difference between what is a faith claim and what is a matter of fact.\u201d",
      "Mary Castle, director of government relations for Texas Values, a right-leaning advocacy group, said there are \u201cclose to 300 common-day phrases that actually come from the Bible\u201d and that students \u201cwill benefit from being able to understand a lot of these references.\u201d",
      "More than 100 people testified at a board meeting this week that rung with emotion from parents, teachers and advocates.",
      "One Democrat on the board, Rebecca Bell-Metereau, said the inclusion of religions in addition to Christianity in the materials was not an \u201cadequate attempt to change that bias.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seems to me like it is trying to place a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,\u201d she said.",
      "One of the board members, Leslie Recine, is a Republican who was appointed to the board just weeks ago by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to temporarily fill a vacant seat. She voted in favor of the curriculum. Days after her appointment, a Democrat who ran unopposed was elected to fill that same board seat starting next year.",
      "Texas' plans to implement Biblical teachings in public school lesson plans is the latest effort by Republican-controlled states to bring religion into the classroom.",
      "In Louisiana, a law to place the Ten Commandments in all public classrooms was blocked by a federal judge earlier this month. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill into law in June, prompting a group of Louisiana public school parents of different faiths to sue.",
      "In Oklahoma, the state's top education official has tried to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for children in fifth through 12th grades. A group of teachers and parents recently filed a lawsuit to stop the Republican state superintendent's plan and his efforts to spend $3 million to purchase Bibles for public schools.",

      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",
      "Some customers could immediately save \u00a3100 a year by moving from paying their bill every three months to paying by direct debit.",
      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",

      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the UK was \"exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets\", which was why the government was concentrating on generating power in the UK.",
      "He admitted the latest price rise would \"concern\" many families.",

      "But that year, the freehold to her property was sold at auction to a north London firm called Assethold. She says its sister company, Eagerstates, took over the management, after which her service charge more than doubled. By 2023, her bill was \u00a33,198 - an increase of 320% in four years.",

      "They all allege that Assethold, owned by Joseph Gurvits, repeatedly overcharged leaseholders for shoddy or non-existent work commissioned by the managing agent, Eagerstates, which is also owned by Mr Gurvits and run by his son, Ronni.",
      "Through analysis of about 140 official court documents from the past five years, the BBC has discovered that Assethold, through Eagerstates, has overcharged leaseholders by at least \u00a31,173,000. Despite this, and multiple complaints to the authorities, the leaseholders we've spoken to say nobody is listening.",
      "'Unbearably stressful'",
      "Sue\u2019s neighbour, James, 31, who lives in the flat upstairs, is also struggling to pay the service charge. When he saw an increased bill, he says he flew into \"absolute panic - my heart was racing and I just didn't know what to do. I thought: 'We can't live here any more.'\u201d",
      "Assethold said: \"We are deeply concerned to hear that residents have reported emotional and financial stress due to these matters.\"",
      "Sue and James argue their bills are \"massively\" inflated and contain oddities such as a charge of \u00a3719 to get a key cut, as well as an annual fee of \u00a3500 to clean a 140x125cm (55x49in) doormat area and \u00a3300 to clean council wheelie bins - both of which Sue and James say have never been done.",
      "James says the situation has become \u201cunbearably stressful\u201d for him and his partner. He says he\u2019s working extra hours and has had to borrow \u00a330,000 to pay the increased charges and to hire solicitors.",

      "\u00a3135 to change two light bulbs",
      "One of the only ways leaseholders can challenge service charges is by going to a first-tier tribunal, a type of civil court.",
      "It is a tribunal\u2019s purpose to determine whether service charges are \u201creasonable and payable\u201d, and not to rule on whether there was any wrongdoing. But by examining hundreds of pages of evidence, we have found several judges' comments that indicate a pattern of bad practice relating to Assethold.",
      "At the lower end of the scale, one judge agreed that \u201c\u00a3135 to change two light bulbs was excessive\". At the other end, we have found that tribunals have awarded sums of up to \u00a3100,000 back to leaseholders for \"unreasonable\" service charges.",
      "One tribunal heard how homeowners had been unable to sell their flats and had been \u201csignificantly affected (financially and psychologically)\u201d.  In this case, about \u00a338,000 of the combined service charge was deemed to be unreasonable.",
      "Assethold was described in court as a \u201cmultimillion-pound freehold company\u201d that had \u201csimply refused to co-operate\u201d with the process, behaviour that was referenced in many of the documents we examined from about 140 court tribunals.",
      "Sebastian O'Kelly, director of registered charity and campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, says his organisation receives a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d number of complaints about Eagerstates.",
      "\u201cSomething is badly wrong with the way it manages its portfolio of properties. We are inundated with complaints about Eagerstates.\u201d",
      "In one case typical of those the BBC investigated, a judge called the firm's tactics \u201cmalicious\u201d, referred to \u201caggressive letters\u201d it had sent and repeatedly commented on the company\u2019s poor management.",
      "Assethold said it was \"actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions\" and had implemented changes where necessary.",
      "\"Across various properties we have always tried to ensure value for money across repairs as well as ensuring a high level of service. Costs are continuously benchmarked and reviewed in line with other contractors.\"",
      "Jane Steel, who bought a one-bedroom flat in Milton Keynes as an investment for her family, is another leaseholder who has told the BBC of her dissatisfaction with Eagerstates.",
      "The combined service charge for the 80-flat block was \u00a360,000 when she and her partner bought the property in 2016. Three years later, it was \u00a3250,000.",
      "Jane, who has an accountancy background, spent weeks going through invoices and says she came across numerous questionable charges, including more than \u00a338,000 to repair lifts that were only a year old. She says the block's leaseholders were also overcharged more than \u00a360,000 in electricity costs.",
      "Assethold said this was \"simply incorrect\", adding that it had credited \u00a320,000 to leaseholders and that future accounts \"will be reduced accordingly\". It said an independent surveyor \"found that the lift was well maintained and was showing age consistent with the installation made\".",
      "'I'm mentally exhausted after \u00a32k service charge hike'",
      "Flat owners' misery over soaring service charges",
      "'Fighting my management company took over my life'",
      "Jane has also complained of many other charges she says are inflated, such as one for \u00a32,640 to put fire safety signs on 25 doors.",
      "Jane says the contractor, Superior Facilities Maintenance {SFM), has billed tens of thousands of pounds for poor-quality work at the building and Eagerstates pays up \"no questions asked\".",
      "Assethold said: \"Any works carried out would be backed up with images and an invoice. We do inspect the properties regularly and do speak to the contractor if any complaints are raised about the works.\"",
      "The BBC has seen dozens of invoices for work by SFM on other buildings, including Sue's and James\u2019s.",
      "Last summer they received a bill for \u00a34,500 from the company, via Eagerstates, for repairs to lead work on the roof. \u201cThey [the contractors] came for a short amount of time - I don\u2019t know what they did up there - then they charged us all that money for it,\u201d James says.",
      "Sue and James have shown me an invoice from SFM that shows they were charged for scaffolding, when they say only a ladder was used to access the roof.",
      "We tried to contact Superior Facilities Maintenance but the phone number listed online didn't connect and its website was defunct.",
      "Leaseholders have shown the BBC invoices that were issued by SFM through Eagerstates. The cost of the work detailed in them amounted to \u00a398,000 since 2022.",
      "We have discovered that SFM hasn't submitted accounts to Companies House, which is a criminal offence. According to Companies House, it has been sent six letters about this.",
      "By delving into the various tribunal documents, we have found other complaints about Eagerstates\u2019 use of SFM.",
      "In a recent case, a judge accepted there had been \u201ca lack of transparency\u201d when  SFM was employed to do roof repairs and said there were \u201csignificant concerns about the quality of the works\u201d. In this case, the judge disallowed almost all the \u00a321,000 charged by SFM.",
      "Assethold said: \"That is simply not the case and defamatory by the judge; there was clear transparency and copious correspondence between ourselves and the leaseholders about the contractor.\"",
      "SFM has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.",
      "'All contractors are bona fide'",
      "While a tribunal does not have powers make judgments on potential criminality or other possible wrongdoing, one judge said they were \u201cnot satisfied\u201d that an invoice provided by SFM, for \u00a31,750, was \u201cbona fide\u201d.",
      "Assethold said: \"That is simply not the case and defamatory by the judge; there was clear transparency and the invoice is bona fide. How a judge can say that with no evidence is absurd and we are considering making a complaint about the judge and these comments as there must be evidence to say this.\"",
      "That invoice was one of several questioned by Raymond Shaw.",
      "He is a leaseholder at a block owned by Assethold in Stratford, east London. He has 20 years' experience working as a criminal lawyer, specialising in fraud. Raymond says the way the company operates makes him \u201craise an eyebrow\".",
      "In 2018, the service charge was a little over \u00a3900 a year. The latest annual bill was for more than \u00a36,000 - a 560% rise.",
      "Assethold disputes the sums provided by Raymond, however he says he and his wife  spent \u201cweeks and months\u201d poring over their bills and looking into the companies Eagerstates works with. They say several are new and others close after a short period.",
      "They believe there are links between some of them, including family connections to the cleaning firm used at his flat block.",
      "Assethold said: \"This is simply not so; all contractors are bona fide and independent.\"",
      "Raymond says the block of 11 flats was charged \u00a310,000 for cleaning last year but the service is \u201catrocious\u201d and, despite the high cost, the building is filthy and bins aren\u2019t collected, causing a problem with rats and a terrible smell.",
      "Assethold said: \"Rubbish piles up due to various short lets and abuse by the residents which means waste is constantly dumped in the property.\"",
      "At a tribunal last year, Raymond and some of his neighbours were awarded back almost \u00a360,000 because of overcharging that took place over a three-year period.",
      "Assethold said \"This included mostly estimated charges, and we have refunded any monies to the leaseholders.\"",
      "'How can they take that away from me?'",
      "The advice given to leaseholders who dispute their service charge is to pay up and take the matter up later, or they could face losing their property in a process known as forfeiture - a measure described as \u201cdraconian\u201d by Sebastian O\u2019Keefe from the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership.",
      "Sue withheld some of her payment in protest over her charges and was threatened with a possession order by Eagerstates, meaning that if she didn\u2019t pay in full, it would start forfeiture proceedings to claim the entire value of her property.",
      "Sue says: \u201cI couldn't believe that. This is my flat, this is my home. How can they take that away from me? I've bought it, it\u2019s mine.",
      "\u201cI still can't cope with it. I get really upset about it.\"",
      "Ji Hoon Yoon, an Assethold leaseholder who won his legal dispute with the firm, is one of many people who have told me of issues with the tribunal system. \"There's nothing within the judicial system to link up all of these cases, even if they've done this time and time again,\" he says.",
      "He has set up a company to help leaseholders trying to challenge charges.",
      "The professional body for managing agents, the Property Institute, is calling for building managers to be regulated - something that hasn't been included in new laws the government is bringing in that are aimed at strengthening leaseholders' powers.",
      "Jane is taking legal action in a bid to win the right to manage her building because, as it stands, she says her flat is unsellable.",
      "\"There's a whole mixture of emotions, really, from anger to disappointment to just unfairness, that the laws aren't there to help,\" she says.",
      "Sue and James have successfully applied to buy the freehold on their building, a Victorian conversion consisting of two flats. I was in Worthing County Court last month when they discovered that Assethold hadn't registered the property to the Land Registry and so was not the legal owner of the freehold.",
      "Granting the pair permission to buy the freehold, the judge said the case was \"extraordinary\", adding that Assethold \"haven't even bothered to turn up\" to give its version of events.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "story": [
      "Farmers have dominated the debate over the recent Budget's change to inheritance tax \u2013 but the issue is much wider than that. Family businesses are affected in the same ways, and there are many more of them.",
      "As the implications dawn on many such families, there are warnings of lower investment, lower employment, lower growth and the potential takeover of a vital part of the economy by big, and often foreign, corporates.",
      "The change comes from the chancellor's decision to tax assets as they pass from one generation to another.",
      "For most people, that tax kicks in for assets worth more than \u00a3325,000, or \u00a3500,000 if the family home is being passed on.",
      "But for farmers and businesses, passing on assets from one generation to the next is currently tax free - and that tax relief has been unlimited.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to exempt the first \u00a31m of agricultural or business property. After that, it will be taxed at 20% - half the rate of inheritance tax required from others.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "It's not clear how many farmers that would affect. The Treasury estimates 500 per year; the National Farmers Union says it's closer to 70,000 in total.",
      "At least part of the wide difference may be explained by farmers also claiming Business Property Relief where their assets are in non-agricultural activity, such as holiday lets, a farm shop or a mail order company.",
      "The number of non-farm businesses affected by this is harder to gauge, but one rough estimate is that it could be about 20 times more.",
      "Scotland doesn't have as many middling-sized family businesses as other economies.",
      "But in some sectors, they play an important role - notably food processing.  Well-known brands such as Tunnock's, Baxter's of Fochabers and Walker's Shortbread are some of the larger ones.",
      "One of the reasons you may not have heard such a backlash against the new tax on inherited wealth is because it's just that - inherited wealth. These families don't get much sympathy for their tax breaks... or at least, not as much as farmers.",
      "The Grant family, distillers of Glenfiddich whisky, is reckoned by Forbes magazine to be worth about \u00a32.9bn. Inheritance tax on transferring that wealth is currently nil.  In future, it could be \u00a3580m.",
      "Some sectors are warning there could be unintended consequences from forcing families, in some cases, to turn a fifth of their assets into the cash necessary to pay HMRC.",
      "As with farmers, many of these businesses are capital intensive, while not generating big incomes.",
      "One of the sectors affected is plant hire and operation - the trucks, diggers and numerous other pieces of equipment that are required by construction and other sectors, including farming.",
      "Family firms account for 85% of the Scottish Plant Operators Association's 350 members. Plant hire has been largely unaffected by consolidation into larger firms.",
      "Requiring large, expensive capital assets, it is hard hit by a tax which targets the value of assets rather than their profitability. The new tax regime will not take into account the ability of firms to raise cash to pay.",
      "Former SPOA president Mark Anderson is managing director of GAP, the fourth largest plant hire operator in Britain.",
      "Based in Glasgow, it is now owned by the third generation of the family.  Mark's father and uncle are past retirement age, but still work within the business.",
      "The firm has 2,200 workers on the payroll. The most recent annual turnover reached \u00a3340m.",
      "Mark says that businesses like his can be loyal to workers and take long-term decisions, riding through the peaks and troughs of the business cycle.  Several of those on the staff have 40 years' experience, while two have more than 50.",
      "If the company were on the stock market or owned by a private equity fund, it would be under pressure for short-term results.",
      "\"Some of our assets take 10 years to deliver a return. These are assets that private equity won't go into because they don't get a return after a year,\" he says.",
      "Mark enjoys his job and likes the people that he works with.",
      "\"I have two daughters, and I wonder if, in the future, this is something my girls would want to go into.\"",
      "Handing over to his daughters is a long way off as they're only aged five and 10.",
      "But following the Budget three weeks ago, planning for succession has become a major source of uncertainty and future cost for businesses like GAP.",
      "There are ways of avoiding the tax, using existing loopholes. The main way is to gift assets to the next generation, on condition that you live for seven years after the transfer.",
      "Businesses seeking to limit their exposure to tax face making macabre judgements on the life expectancy of older members - or insuring against the death of younger ones, who could defy tax planning if they die young.",
      "In many cases, like with the Grant family of distillers, the wealth is split across siblings and cousins. As assets pass to the next generation, there may be a slightly lower tax bill because of the \u00a31m exemption per person.",
      "But the need to raise cash could force some family members to sell a share, and a lot of that could destabilise the firm.",
      "Ryan Scatterty is managing director of Thistle Seafoods near Peterhead, and is the fifth generation at the firm. It also has a processing unit in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, employs 800 people and has a \u00a3133m turnover.",
      "He says the seafood sector is dominated by family firms who are in a similar position to the farmers in the north east of Scotland who are protesting about the inheritance tax proposals.",
      "He says beneficiaries are unlikely to have the cash needed to pay HMRC, even with 10 years of installments.",
      "\"The only way to come up with that is to sell the business.  That could be to a large multinational, which could be foreign-owned, and without that commitment to the local community,\" he says.",
      "\"The question for the government is: do they want these sectors to be owned by giant multinationals?\"",
      "He also says the inheritance tax change is a disincentive to invest. If an investment was to increase a family firm's value by \u00a310m, he believes that the 20% tax bill at the point of death may no longer make it look financially viable.",
      "Paul Andrews, founder of Family Business United, says its members were shocked by the Budget.",
      "\"It's caused a lot of conversations around succession. The unintended consequences will be reduced investment,\" he says.",

      "The Treasury says Rachel Reeves made the choice to raise tax both to stabilise public finances and improve public services, and that her tax choices were to put an additional burden on businesses and those with wealth.",

      "Chris Campbell - a tax specialist at Icas, the institute of chartered accountants in Scotland - says its members have been busy this month with approaches for advice.",

    "summary": "The charges could jeopardise the ambitions of one of the world\u2019s richest men, both at home and abroad.",
    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US.",
      "Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad.",
      "Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy.",
      "Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.",
      "India\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading  infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share),  seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market).",
      "With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide.",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.)",
      "\u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.",
      "This crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI.",
      "\u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC.",
      "For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects.",
      "\"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"",
      "The latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal.  \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC.",
      "What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "While the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong.",
      "\u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says.",
      "Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says.",
      "\"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has been charged with fraud in the US, which has accused him of orchestrating a $250m (\u00a3198m) bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US.",
      "The criminal charges, filed on Wednesday in New York, are the latest blow to 62-year-old Mr Adani, one of Asia's richest men, whose business empire extends from ports and airports to renewable energy.",
      "In the indictment, prosecutors alleged the tycoon and other senior executives had agreed to the payments to Indian officials to win contracts for his renewable energy company expected to yield more than $2bn in profits over 20 years.",
      "The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless\".",
      "\"All possible legal recourse will be sought,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Shares of Adani Enterprises, the group's flagship firm, closed down 22% on Thursday. Other group firms also closed in the red. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "The conglomerate has been operating under a cloud since 2023, when US short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report accusing it of decades of \"brazen\" stock manipulation and accounting fraud.",
      "The claims, which Mr Adani denied, prompted a major market sell-off and an investigation by India's market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).",
      "Later, Hindenburg also accused Sebi's chief Madhabi Puri Buch of having links with off-shore funds used by the Adani group - both Ms Buch and the group have denied this.",
      "But the US indictment is one of the biggest challenges the group has faced. Apart from Mr Adani there are seven other defendants, including his nephew.",
      "Reports of the bribery probe into the company have been circulating for months.",
      "Prosecutors said the US started investigating the company in 2022, and found the inquiry obstructed.",
      "They allege that executives raised $3bn in loans and bonds, including from US firms, on the backs of false and misleading statements related to the firm's anti-bribery practices and policies, as well as reports of the bribery probe.",
      "\u201cAs alleged, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars and... lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement announcing the charges.",
      "\u201cMy office is committed to rooting out corruption in the international marketplace and protecting investors from those who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets,\u201d he added.",
      "On several occasions Mr Adani met personally with government officials to advance the bribery scheme, officials said.",
      "The US Attorney positions in the US are appointed by the president. The filing comes just weeks after Donald Trump won election to the White House, pledging to overhaul the US Justice Department.",
      "After Trump won, Mr Adani had congratulated him on social media and pledged last week to invest $10bn in the US.",
      "Kenya's president cancels major deals with Adani Group",

      "But it might be harder for the billionaire, he said, to \"shake off\" the allegations made by US authorities.",
      "US investment firm GQG Partners LLC, which has invested nearly $10bn in the Adani Group, has said that it is \"monitoring the charges\" and may take \"appropriate\" actions for its portfolios.",
      "Moody's Ratings said that the indictment was a \"credit negative\" for the group's firms.",
      "\"Our main focus when assessing Adani Group is on the ability of the group\u2019s companies to access capital to meet their liquidity requirements and on its governance practices,\" it said.",
      "The issue has also set off a political storm in India.",
      "Mr Adani is a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has long faced claims from opposition politicians alleging that he has benefited from his political ties, which he denies.",
      "Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi demanded in a press conference that Mr Adani should be arrested and that Ms Buch should be removed from her position as Sebi chief. He accused Modi of protecting the businessman.",
      "Modi and the government have not commented on the issue yet. Sambit Patra, a leader of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), dismissed the accusations against Modi and said that it was up to the Adani Group to \"issue a statement and defend itself\".",

    "story": [
      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has given more detail about plans to allow dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "It is consulting on two options, either extending the deadline to the end of May or until December 2025.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",
      "The two options are:",
      "Giving dealers until the end of May to deal with complaintsAllowing them until December 2025 to respond, to align the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints",

      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, described the FCA's plan as a \"sensible move\".",

      "The inflation rate, which charts the rising cost of living, increased to 2.3% in October.",
      "Prices aren't soaring at the rate seen over recent times. Inflation peaked at 11.1% two years ago. But, there is concern about the impact the situation is having, and will have, on people's finances.",
      "Here are four ways these figures affect you.",
      "1. The cost of living crisis isn't over",
      "Any trip to the supermarket reminds us that prices have risen sharply in recent years.",
      "Compared with October 2020, prices of goods and services are 24% higher  - driven by increases in food and energy prices.",
      "That shows the ongoing impact of price rises over the last few years, irrespective of what's happening now.",
      "While high inflation is considered harmful, a small amount of inflation is considered necessary to drive economic growth.",
      "The target rate for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, set by the government, is 2%.",

      "Wages are rising at a faster rate, offsetting some of these prices increases, but charities' worries are growing about those on benefits.",
      "Most working-age benefits, such as Universal Credit, will go up by 1.7% in April - which analysts predict will be below the pace at which prices are rising.",
      "Lots of people are still struggling to pay back debts that built up over the last few years. Some \u00a33.7bn is collectively owed to energy suppliers from people unable to pay their gas and electricity bills, for example.",
      "2. Inflation is volatile",
      "Analysts had expected a smaller rise in inflation than 2.3%.",
      "But you shouldn't put too much store on a one-month figure.",
      "As with any economic statistic, one month's data can buck a general trend and should be considered alongside other published data.",
      "It is worth noting too that some of the factors driving the latest rise in prices came from outside of the UK.",
      "Higher energy costs are primarily the result of price of energy on the global markets, but which have an impact on households' and businesses' bills.",
      "3. Interest rate cuts will be more gradual",
      "Interest rates affect the cost of borrowing and the returns available for savers.",
      "The benchmark - or base - rate, set by the Bank of England currently stands at 4.75%. It was cut from 5% earlier this month.",
      "This is the chief tool used by the Bank to try to keep inflation at its 2% target. Raising rates cools borrowing and spending, thus limiting price rises, and vice versa.",
      "With inflation much lower than its peak, the Bank has - and still is - expected to reduce interest rates.",
      "But recent events, such as the Budget and now a higher-than-expected inflation rate, mean the markets have revised their predictions for when and how often those cuts will come.",
      "Even the Bank's governor cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d, prompting forecasts that the base rate is unlikely to be reduced in December.",
      "The impact for homeowners is that fixed mortgage rates have actually been creeping up, despite the latest interest rate cut.",
      "Official figures show the cost of renting a home has also risen. Average rent paid to private landlords was up 8.7% in year to October, the ONS says.",
      "Savers, however, may see the interest paid on their savings hold up better than would otherwise be the case.",
      "4. We don't know what will happen next",
      "Global and domestic factors will have a significant impact on how quickly prices rise, but how they will play out remains uncertain.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election was helped by his decision to tap into voters' concerns about the cost of living, analysts have suggested.",
      "He has pledged a blanket 20% tariff on all imports into the US.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "In addition there are schemes to train farmers on the latest techniques for growing and processing beans.",
      "\u201cThere is a vast opportunity for Indian farmers to enter into cocoa cultivation and avail the benefits,\" says Dr Femina, who works in the government department tasked with developing cocoa production.",
      "Business is also investing in new cocoa tree vareities.",
      "Dr Minimol J.S., is the head of cocoa research at Kerala Agriculture University and is working with Cadbury to develop hybrid cocoa trees.",
      "In the project's orchard existing high-performing varieties are cross-bred with exotic species.",
      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",
      "Mr Chordia also runs an agricultural school, where  farmers are shown the latest innovations in fermenting and drying beans.",
      "\"We are constantly focussing on improving the post-harvest practices for cocoa farmers in India,\" he says.",

      "Khan was re-elected in May and his third term of office ends in May 2028.",
      "Speaking to the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, Richard Watts, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said \u201cthe scheme has been enormously successful\u201d and \u201call the benefits that we hoped we would see based on previous evidence we are now seeing city wide\u201d.",

      "\"Therefore we will announce that funding in the group budget papers in due course.\u201d",

      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",

      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",

      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",
      "Looking at the impact on pupils\u2019 performance in school, the report says that the policy \u201cappears to be supporting calmer behaviour in the classroom, with school staff reporting afternoon lessons running more smoothly when children have had a hot, healthy meal\u201d.",

    "summary": "One year after being dropped by her record label, Gigi Perez topped the UK charts. How did it happen?",
    "story": [
      "In April, a fan approached American singer Gigi Perez after a show, and proudly showed off their latest tattoo.",
      "\"Gigi I \ud83d\udda4 U,\" read the ink. The singer was lost for words.",
      "\"In my head, I was like, \u2018Please don't regret that\u2019,'\" she laughs.",
      "\"It's hard for me to process that somebody else has my name permanently on their skin.",
      "\"But, I mean, it's just the ultimate honour to know that the music impacted them so greatly that they would do that.\"",
      "It was the first time anyone had felt passionately enough to turn her name into a tattoo - and the timing could not have been better.",
      "Six months earlier, Gigi been dropped by her record label, in the middle of a promotional trip to London.",
      "And after having to move back to her parents' house, in Florida, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter had to reassess her life.",
      "\"I was free falling,\" she says.",
      "\"I had no income, I was back home, and I was starting to doubt myself.",
      "\"But I was like, 'Let me just give myself a year to learn how to record and produce my own records.",
      "\"From there, if I need to get a job so I can still make music, I'll do that.",
      "\"And then everything happened...\"",
      "Everything, in case you have not been following Gigi's story, involved scoring a global hit single out of nowhere.",
      "Sailor Song, an aching love ballad about falling for a woman who looks like the actress Anne Hathaway, exploded online in June and quickly became a real-world success.",
      "In the UK, it went to number one, ending Sabrina Carpenter's nine-week run at the top.",
      "The song also reached the summit in Ireland and Latvia and made the top 10 everywhere from New Zealand to Belgium.",
      "\"I knew the song was special to me,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"I just didn't know it was going to be special to so many other people.\"",
      "When she found out it had reached number one, \"I got out of the shower and just started crying,\" Gigi told the UK's Official Charts Company.",
      "The success marks a neat conclusion to a messy origin story.",
      "Born in New Jersey and raised in Florida, Gigi was a drama school nerd who turned to music when she realised she was \"never going to be cast in the ingenue role\".",
      "Self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the US streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, Sometimes (Backwood).",
      "The song earned her a contract with Interscope Records and Gigi supported Coldplay on their Music of the Spheres tour before she had even played a headline show of her own.",
      "Looking back, she says that initial wave of success created a pressure to expand her career too quickly. For a long time, she felt \"stuck and limited\" by her lack of progression.",
      "\"It was this cognitive dissonance where I\u2019d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be coming to the show,\" Gigi says.",
      "And by the time she played London last November, she knew she had reached breaking point.",
      "\"I asked God, or the universe, 'Open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,'\" she says.",
      "\"I knew it had to happen - but I was so terrified of what that meant.\"",
      "'Not a democracy'",
      "Interscope released her two days later. But instead of the world ending, Gigi's energy  renewed. She wrote more songs - and taught herself how to produce them, by watching YouTube tutorials.",
      "Sailor Song came to her in a sudden burst of inspiration this February.",
      "\"I was on my bed, my door was open and I was just messing around, jamming,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"My little sister walked by, and she was like, \u2018Gigi, what was that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea, but I think it's really cool.'\"",
      "\"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\"",
      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",
      "But the chorus is undeniable.",
      "\"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\"",
      "Of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long.",
      "In the US, evangelical Christians criticised Sailor Song for the line: \"I don't believe in God, but you're my saviour.\"",
      "Gigi's response, posted to TikTok, was uncompromising.",
      "\"My songwriting is not a democracy,\" she wrote, \"and that applies to every artist's work.\"",
      "The singer's struggles with faith run deep.",
      "Her parents became born-again Christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for Gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in Florida.",
      "The experience was not all positive.",
      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",
      "In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable.",
      "\"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene.",
      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",
      "\"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched  on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says.",
      "\"And so I made it for myself.",
      "\"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\"",
      "That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it.",
      "\"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says.",
      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",
      "And with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before Gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms."

      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",

      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",

      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",

      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",

    "summary": "Rosie Millard quit over grants for LGBT youth charity whose ex-chief was convicted of child sex assaults.",
    "story": [
      "The chair of the BBC's Children in Need charity has resigned, after reports that she protested over grants awarded to an LGBT youth charity, whose former chief had previously been involved in a child abuse scandal.",
      "Rosie Millard, a writer and broadcaster, accused the charity of \"institutional failure\" in her letter of resignation shared with the Times.",
      "Millard objected to \u00a3466,000 being awarded to LGBT Youth Scotland (LGBTYS) , a charity which supports young gay and transgender people.",
      "Its former chief James Rennie was convicted in 2009 of child sex assaults. The grants from Children In Need began seven months later, when the charity had new management in place.",
      "BBC News has not seen Millard's resignation letter.",
      "A Children in Need spokesman said: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of all children and young people.",
      "\"When allegations were made in relation to LGBT Youth Scotland their grant was immediately suspended with the full support of the board and a review began. In order to do this thoroughly and fairly the review took three months and culminated in the decision to withdraw funding.\"",
      "Rennie, who had been chief executive of LGBTYS from 2003 to 2008 and is also a previous SNP adviser, was jailed in 2009 after being revealed as a member of a paedophile ring.",
      "He was given a life sentence for sexually assaulting a three-month-old child and for conspiring to get access to children in order to abuse them. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 13 years, later reduced to eight on appeal.",
      "Rennie's crimes were found to have had no relation to or impact on the charity and were only uncovered by a police investigation. LGBTYS cut ties with him immediately and have said they \"condemn any actions which harm children and young people\".",
      "Children in Need suspended grants to the charity in May 2024, after Millard says she alerted them to his case. It withdrew funding around three months later following a review.",
      "However, Millard, who used to be an arts correspondent for BBC News, criticised Children in Need for what she said was a lack of due diligence.",
      "She accused chief executive Simon Antrobus of failing to respond \u201cwith the necessary level of seriousness\u201d and hesitating to take action.",
      "She alleged that he eventually cut funding to the charity only because of fear of negative publicity.",
      "BBC News has contacted Millard for comment.",
      "Antrobus, who has been chief executive of Children In Need since 2016 and previously held senior positions at Parkinson's UK and Scope, has not publicly commented.",
      "Review of working methods",
      "Another man, who contributed to schools guidance put together by LGBT Youth Scotland, was convicted this year of sharing indecent images of children including some of newborn babies.",
      "Andrew Easton was a young person who attended services of LGBT Youth Scotland in the 2000s, and, as a result, contributed to a 2010 guide for young people about coming out. However, he was never an employee of the charity.",
      "He pleaded guilty in September to \u00adcommunicating online with someone he believed to be a child, downloading indecent images of children and distributing indecent images of children.",
      "He was sentenced to a community order, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, put on the sex offenders register for three years and told to take part in a sex offenders programme.",
      "In 2022, two men said that they were groomed at LGBTYS around the time Rennie was chief executive. In response, LGBTYS suspended a staff member and referred itself to the police.",
      "A Children in Need spokesman said: \"The Children in Need board of trustees are supportive of the actions taken by the CEO and senior leadership team and stand by the decisions made.",
      "\"Rosie at all times retained the board\u2019s support. In the wake of her resignation, in order to ensure any lessons learnt are captured, the trustees have instigated a review of ways of working between the board and executive in which Rosie has kindly agreed to participate.\u201d",
      "'Really gutted'",
      "Mhairi Crawford, chief executive of LGBTYS, said that Millard\u2019s resignation letter \u201cdemonstrates the ideologically driven nature of her attacks on our organisation\u201d.",
      "Crawford said: \u201cWe are pleased to see confirmation that Children in Need\u2019s investigations into the work of LGBT Youth Scotland found nothing to report.",
      "\u201cTime and time again, those with anti-inclusivity motives point to historic allegations in attempts to destroy our reputation. Allegations that have been investigated and cleared by Police Scotland, and proven to have had no link to our work.\u201d",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Thursday Crawford added she was \"really gutted\" to have lost funding from Children in Need.",
      "\"We worked with them [Children in Need] for the best part of 15 years, and it's really sad to see a funder choosing to take that line,\" she said.",
      "\"I understand why they've done it, and I respect it, but it's really sad that it happened, and really disappointing how it reached the press and how it communicated publicly.\"",
      "Tim Davie, the BBC's director general, praised Millard on Wednesday for her \u201csignificant impact on countless children\u201d. Children in Need raised more than \u00a339 million in its annual broadcast on Friday."

    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has told the BBC that she channelled her personal feelings of loss when filming Wicked.",
      "\"Losing someone you love is something we've all unfortunately had to experience - and sometimes we have the privilege to say goodbye and sometimes we don't,\" she says.",
      "Grande, 31, plays Galinda Upland in the film, which is an adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical exploring the Wizard of Oz universe from the perspective of two witches.",
      "The two-time Grammy award winner has suffered personal tragedy in recent years, after the 2017 Manchester bombing of her concert and the death of her former partner Mac Miller a year later.",
      "She says appearing in Wicked, one of the first Broadway shows she saw as a child, \"feels like a homecoming\".",
      "\"This music has always brought such comfort and now being able to spend time with it and be trusted with it is the privilege of a lifetime.\"",
      "In the weeks running up to the film's release, the close relationship between Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo has been in the spotlight.",
      "\"From the moment we were cast, Cynthia invited me over and we hung out for five hours and we laughed and we cried and got to know each other.",
      "\"We had a real conversation right off the bat about creating a safe space for each other and being honest with each other,\" she says.",
      "Grande and Erivo's characters begin in the Oz universe as university students, before later becoming enemies as Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Erivo, 37, has described her role as \"a real honour\" and nods to the foundations formed by the original stage actors Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, who she calls \"the architects\".",
      "\"We've been handed something really special and it's a dream come true and truly big shoes to fill,\" she adds.",
      "Mixed reviews",
      "Critics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\".",
      "There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara, who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\".",
      "However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films.",
      "The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\".",
      "\"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added.",
      "But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"",
      "Erivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple.",
      "She says she was able to draw on her own experiences of struggling with acceptance for the role of Elphaba, who is outcast for her green exterior.",
      "\"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says.",
      "Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.",
      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",
      "Its reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat.",
      "Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero.",
      "Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\".",
      "Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\".",
      "He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness.",
      "\"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"",
      "The musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever.",
      "\"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says.",
      "Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time.",
      "He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters.",
      "\"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds.",
      "\"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that.",
      "\"We were all going through stuff in our own lives and I think they were generous to offer that up within the roles of Glinda, Elphaba and the Wizard.\"",

    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

      "Some would also call it a gimmick, which is partly true, except that not even Ogden could seriously have calculated that the song and the story behind it would really catch on.",
      "\"It has connected with people,\" the singer says. \"I didn't anticipate it, but I knew I wanted to have something that made people go, what's that?",
      "\"Even if people think it is ludicrous, it's an entry point. And people were just ready for a bit of fun, I suppose.",

      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",

      "\"We put everything into that show, and in no way did it feel disappointing. It blew us away even more than we expected.\"",

    "story": [
      "The NHS in England came within \u201csix or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said.",
      "The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems.",
      "He stated there was never a \u201cnational shortage\u201d of PPE for healthcare workers but \u201cin some places, they did run out - and it was awful\u201d.",
      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",
      "On Thursday, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives.",
      "'Left to die'",
      "Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid.",
      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",
      "He said he felt it was his job to \u201cshield\u201d the health service from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d.",
      "Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added."

      "The concern is that a woman could be at risk of becoming pregnant having taken inactive pills believing she was taking effective hormonal contraception.",
      "Bayer Ltd's recall notice says: \"While only a limited number of packs from the respective batch is affected, as a precautionary measure, no tablets from these packs shall be used until you have consulted your healthcare practitioner, as they may potentially not provide the contraceptive protection you expect.\"",

    "story": [
      "Suspected methanol poisoning from tainted drinks has reportedly killed six tourists in a Laos holiday town in the past fortnight.",
      "A British woman, two Australian women, a US man and two Danish nationals have died. The deaths remain under police investigation, but reports suggest they may have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulation in food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml or half a shot can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It mainly affects poorer countries- outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as the hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",
      "\"You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 it\u2019s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent,\" one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.",
      "They said methanol poisonings were frequently reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",
      "\"I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists - that's not good for them or their industry either,\" the diplomat said.",
      "\"It's more about the production side \u2013 there being being low education, low regulation, people cutting corners.\"",
      "What can be done about it?",

      "The prime minister has insisted it \"makes sense\" to cut winter fuel payments to millions of pensioners, as he was pressed on the change in a series of BBC local radio interviews in Downing Street.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer was repeatedly asked why he was \"picking a fight\" with pensioners, and about warnings that more would fall into poverty as a result and that some would die.",
      "He said it was important to protect pensioners who most needed the allowance, but many did not need it because they were \"relatively wealthy\".",
      "He argued the government's finances were \"really, really difficult\", and the government had to prioritise delivering for the NHS, schools and other public services used by pensioners.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that access to winter fuel payments, worth up to \u00a3300, would be restricted from this winter to people claiming pension credit, with the aim of saving \u00a31.5bn a year.",
      "The prime minister urged people who were eligible for pension credit to take it up, saying it would guarantee they continued to receive the payment.",
      "He told Radio WM there were \"lots of decisions\" made in the Budget which he would have preferred \"not to have had to make\".",
      "\"But when you inherit a broken economy, when you then find out there was \u00a322bn  which doesn't appear on the books, and you'd need to balance the books, very, very difficult decisions have to be made,\" he added.",

      "\"There aren't many farms year on year that are sold in excess of that amount, and therefore that threshold is high,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir denied claims on Radio Bristol that he was on the side of farmers or small business owners, or \"for keeping millions of pensioners warm\".",

      "Following the arrest warrants being issued on Thursday, Downing Street said the UK government respected the ICC's independence and remained focused on pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.",

    "title": "Farming tax row - BBC Verify on which figures are more reliable and why",
    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Government claims have been hotly contested by farmers, and the BBC has been scrutinised for its analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Since the government unveiled its new inheritance tax plans for farmers in last month\u2019s Budget, there has been intense debate about how many people will be affected and to what extent.",
      "Many of the claims from the government have been hotly contested by farmers, and BBC Verify has come under scrutiny over some of the figures it has relied on to try to establish the number of farms impacted by the change.",
      "The debate has revolved around estimates provided by farmers\u2019 groups, including that the new tax could \"harm\" up to 70,000 farms over time.",
      "Our analysis found that the figure was likely to be somewhere closer to the number provided by the government - about 500 estates per year. That remains our assessment.",
      "Farmers' groups say the changes have been \u201cbuilt on bad data\u201d. The government says it wants to make the inheritance tax system fairer and discourage wealthy people from investing in land solely to avoid the tax.",
      "Here, we go through all the numbers and examine the claims and counter-claims.",
      "What are the contested figures?",
      "Under the government\u2019s plans, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be subject to inheritance tax at 20%.",
      "The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has estimated that the tax change  \u201ccould harm\u201d 70,000 UK farms. This would represent roughly 33% of the 209,000 UK farms, as identified by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "The CLA figure is not an annual one and, clearly, a farm would only be potentially subject to inheritance tax if it was passed on, following a death.",
      "The government, in trying to assess the impact of its tax change, looked instead at recent figures for the number of actual claims for tax relief for agricultural estates.",
      "At this point, it\u2019s worth stressing that an agricultural estate is not the same as a landed estate, or farm: an \u201cestate\u201d is a legal term for the value of the money, property and possessions an individual passes on upon their death. In this case, it\u2019s an estate that includes some agricultural land.",
      "The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has claimed up to about 520 inherited agricultural estates a year \u201cwill be impacted to some extent by these changes\u201d.",
      "The Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said \"three quarters of farmers will pay nothing as a result of the changes\u201d.",
      "But farming groups continue to dispute the government figures, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) pointing to other figures from Defra which it says \u201cshow that only 34% of farms are under \u00a31 million net worth\u201d. This would imply that around two thirds of farms could potentially be affected by the Budget tax change.",
      "The NFU has also released analysis which it says shows that \u201caround 75% of commercial family farms will be above the \u00a31 million threshold\u201d.",
      "Below, we look into the challenges when it comes to reaching an exact conclusion on the numbers affected, and provide more detail on which figures are more reliable - and explain why.",
      "Is Defra data more accurate?",
      "Farming groups have partially based their arguments against the tax change on data from Defra\u2019s Farm Business Survey, which shows the net worth of farms in England in 2022/23.",
      "The figures suggest that 17% of farms in England have a net worth - the difference between their assets and liabilities - of between \u00a31m and \u00a31.49m. Another 49% of farms have a value of \u00a31.5m and over.",
      "This suggests, on the face of it, that 66% of farms in England could potentially be affected by the tax changes.",
      "However there are some problems with this calculation, as the data from the Defra survey is not necessarily representative of the overall UK-wide farming sector.",
      "The survey - which is based on a sample of just over 1,350 farms  - states that it is designed to be representative of only about half of the farms in England (rather than the rest of the UK) and also excludes farms which bring in little revenue.",
      "Moreover, the Defra data shows estimates of individual farm values, but does not show their ownership.",
      "Multiple farms can be owned by a single person who then lets them out to tenants. In England about 46% of agricultural holdings were wholly or partially rented out to tenant farmers in 2023 according to Defra data. If the owner of multiple farms sought to pass on those farms upon his or her death, this would all show up in a single estate in the inheritance tax relief claim.",
      "The financial impact would be on that individual\u2019s inheritance tax bill, not each farm.",
      "A farm could also be jointly owned by multiple people. If, for example, five people owned a \u00a35m farm they could each pass on their \u00a31m share without their estates having to pay any inheritance tax.",
      "This is why it is more appropriate to use tax data on inheritance relief, rather than farm survey data, to estimate the impact of the change in the Budget on individuals.",
      "Does including business property relief change the picture?",
      "Another challenge is that some initial government calculations of the number of estates likely to be affected only referred to Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and not Business Property Relief (BPR).",
      "APR relates mainly to the value of land. BPR can include a farm's machinery and livestock, which can also make up a significant proportion of the value of an agricultural estate.",
      "It is true that both APR and BPR relief will be capped at a combined \u00a31m for inheritance tax purposes, meaning a single estate will be able to claim no more than \u00a31m in these combined reliefs.",
      "Farming groups have claimed that farmers often also use BPR so any calculation of the impact of the tax changes based solely on APR claims will not capture the full effect on farming estates.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "However, the government has now published figures based on HMRC inheritance tax data which incorporate historical APR and BPR relief claims, and should capture those agricultural estates making use of both reliefs.",
      "These figures suggest that while taking BPR into account as well as APR does push up the number and proportion of estates likely to be affected, it does not fundamentally change the picture.",
      "The data shows that in 2021-22 the number of estates making combined APR and BPR claims where the value of the estate was more than \u00a31.5m was 383, or 22% of all claims.",
      "The number of estates worth more than \u00a31.5m making APR claims solely was 278, or 16% of the total.",
      "Why is it \u00a31.5m and not \u00a31m?",
      "The government\u2019s latest figures break down the impact using the threshold of \u00a31.5m, not \u00a31m, explaining to BBC Verify that this was chosen based on the assumption that an individual estate\u2019s standard inheritance tax reliefs of \u00a3500,000 would be added to their new \u00a31m allowance.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury and HMRC for a breakdown of the figures using \u00a31m as a threshold - which would be consistent with its original calculations showing APR claims only - but it said it hasn't collated those figures.",
      "The CenTax think tank has studied the impact of APR and BPR reliefs.",
      "CenTax\u2019s co-director Arun Advani argues that the government\u2019s estimates of the number of agricultural estates likely to be affected by the capping of both reliefs at \u00a31m combined - up to 520 estates a year - seems reasonable.",
      "\u201cThe data on historic claims are a much more reliable guide to the number of affected estates than surveys of farm sizes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhile the government's reforms are certainly likely to be difficult for some farmers, particularly given the many other factors weighing down farmer's incomes, numbers claiming tens of thousands will be affected aren't consistent with the evidence.\u201d",
      "David Sturrock from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies also said that the Treasury\u2019s figures were \u201ccredible\u201d and added that including the impact of capping BPR \u201cdoesn\u2019t radically change the picture in terms of estates affected\u201d.",
      "The NFU has pointed out that if 500 estates were affected per year that could amount to 15,000 over 30 years - but this would still be some way short of the 70,000 figure.",
      "Should small estates be excluded from calculations?",
      "The NFU argues that many estates included in the government figures are too small to be considered working farms.",
      "Its case is simple - if you were to exclude these small farms, the percentage of real, working farms affected would be much higher.",
      "It has pointed to separate APR inheritance tax relief claims data from HMRC, via the Treasury, which breaks down estates by size.",
      "This shows that in 2021-22, 474 claims (27% of the 1,730 total) were for estates valued between \u00a30 and \u00a3250,000, and that 398 (23% of the total) were for estates valued at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000.",
      "\u201cVery few viable farms are worth under \u00a31m,\u201d says the NFU president Tom Bradshaw.",
      "That's a reasonable argument.",
      "If estates with a value below \u00a3500,000 were excluded from the APR figures, the share of the total affected each year would automatically rise from the 27% implied by the government\u2019s initial calculations.",
      "The NFU\u2019s analysis suggests only including what it categorises as \u201cworking farms\u201d would increase the share affected from 27% to 49%.",
      "However, the estimated absolute number of affected estates - roughly 500 in each year - would not be affected by that change.",
      "Is there a \u00a33m allowance?",
      "A key question is where the effective financial inheritance tax threshold for estates with agricultural assets kicks in.",
      "Farming groups have suggested the value of any inherited estate with agricultural assets over \u00a31m will be impacted.",
      "This is understandable as this was the threshold figure cited in the Budget.",
      "However, the government has since claimed that the effective threshold for many farmers\u2019 estates to pay inheritance tax could be not \u00a31m, but \u00a33m, because of various inheritance tax reliefs available to estates.",
      "A higher effective threshold would have a major impact on the proportion and number of estates affected.",
      "The overnment\u2019s claim is based on the fact that the estates of farmers, like the estates of everyone else subject to inheritance tax, are eligible for a standard tax-free allowance, known as a nil-rate band, of \u00a3325,000.",
      "They are are also eligible for the residential nil-rate band of \u00a3175,000. The latter is available to people who are passing on a main residence to a direct descendant, such as children or grandchildren, as part of their estate. Together these two allowances total \u00a3500,000.",
      "This is on top of the \u00a31m tax-free allowance for agricultural estates.",
      "It\u2019s not just the \u00a31.5m allowance for a single individual - for anyone married their spouse has a similar effective allowance. Adding these together - and allowing for the ability of farming couples to share their allowances - does create a potential for some farming estates to pass on \u00a33m entirely free of inheritance tax.",
      "However, importantly, this could only be achieved if each partner passed on \u00a31.5m of their total assets at death sequentially, rather than in one \u00a33m estate upon the death of the second partner.",
      "The ability of estates to push up the threshold to \u00a33m will also depend on individual circumstances. Of course, not every farmer is married, and some might not be passing on a main residence.",
      "However, it\u2019s legitimate to assume that many farming estates would be able to use these allowances, which are used by the rest of the population.",
      "Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that a farming estate can be affected by this inheritance tax change, without the estate necessarily ending up paying more money in tax, because of the need for individuals to spend more time planning their tax arrangements than they did before.",
      "Farm tax changes will not affect 'vast majority' - PM",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",

      "Prescott had been a Labour MP since 1970 - and had already made two failed attempts to become the party's deputy leader, when he strode on to the party conference stage in Brighton in 1993, to deliver the speech of his life.",
      "Labour's then-leader John Smith was trying to bring in controversial changes to switch to one-member-one vote for selecting parliamentary candidates, in the teeth of strong opposition from many trade unions who saw it as a dilution of their power.",
      "With Smith facing likely defeat and, with it, possibly the end of his leadership, he turned to Prescott - the lifelong trade unionist - to win over waverers.",
      "Despite a later reputation for mangling his words, Prescott's performance in the conference hall was an impassioned tour de force.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this man, our leader, put his head on the block... He has put his head there, now it is time to vote. Give us a little trust,\" he said.",

      "Climate campaigner and then-US Vice-President Al Gore said Prescott \"fought like hell\" for an agreement and was \"an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come\".",
      "He \"possessed an inherent ability to connect with people about the issues that mattered to them - a talent that others spend years studying and cultivating, but that was second nature to him,\" Gore added.",

      "The campaign itself is remembered for little else, as Labour was returned to power with almost as large a Commons majority as four years earlier.",
      "Arriving for a party rally in Rhyl, Denbighshire, a pro-hunting supporter cracked an egg on Prescott's head.",

      "Two Jags to zero Jags",
      "Prescott was given the nickname \u201ctwo Jags\u201d by the press after it was revealed he used two Jaguar cars \u2013 one of them his own and the second a ministerial car.",
      "During the Labour conference in Bournemouth in 1999, his government car took him 250 yards from his hotel to the conference centre.",
      "On stage, as environment and transport secretary, he then urged motorists to cut their carbon emissions by using public transport.",
      "He later claimed he had taken the short journey by car because his wife, Pauline, did not like to have her hair blown about on the seafront.",
      "In 2021, Lord Prescott revealed he had since decided to make his \u201cown small contribution to cutting carbon emissions\u201d.",
      "\"I am now zero Jags \u2013 selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won\u2019t save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said: \u2018Great acts are made up of small deeds\u2019,\u201d he wrote in The Times.",
      "His son David told the BBC his father had given up cars for good.",
      "Devolution delayed",
      "When Prescott became deputy PM in 1997, he was also handed a very large portfolio as secretary of state for the new Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.",
      "In 2001, this was broken up, with separate departments for environment, food and rural affairs, and for transport, hived off.",
      "One of Prescott's passions was devolution for England's regions - to follow Scotland and Wales - though the elected regional assemblies he envisaged would have had fewer powers.",
      "Because of the scale of opposition to his plans, the government held a referendum on them in 2004, in the North-East region where support was thought to be strongest.",
      "The result was a bitter pill for Prescott to swallow, with 78% of the votes cast against devolution. A young Dominic Cummings was the mastermind behind the victorious No campaign, trying out tactics and messages he would later use in the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
      "Prescott's plan for elected regional assemblies was quickly shelved.",
      "Nevertheless, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown, said Prescott was the first person to give the north of England a political profile and paved the way for later devolution to metro mayors.",
      "Old flame at a TV wedding",
      "Prescott briefly appeared in hit TV comedy Gavin & Stacey in 2010.",
      "In the third series of the BBC show, Ruth Jones\u2019s character Nessa Jenkins regularly recalled fictional previous relationships with celebrities including Prescott.",
      "In the final episode, he made a cameo appearance as himself, arriving as a guest at Nessa\u2019s wedding as she prepared to marry fiance Dave Coaches.",
      "He enters the church and congratulates Dave, who replies: \u201cCheers John, nice to see you.\u201d",
      "Prescott wrote on his blog: \"I suppose I have to accept it appears I\u2019ve lost out to a better man.\u201d",
      "According to Nessa on screen, he gave her \u201cfull use of one of the Jags\u201d.",
      "Tears over Billy Elliot",
      "For many Labour supporters and activists, there was a sense that Prescott provided an antidote to the spin and slick presentation of New Labour.",
      "Often ridiculed by parliamentary sketch writers for mangling the English language, to supporters he appeared an ordinary man facing the intellectual bullying by people with a better education.",
      "His favourite film was Billy Elliot, the tale of a northern working-class boy who fights poverty and prejudice to become a leading ballet dancer.",
      "Prescott said he had seen it five times after it first came out in 2000. He also revealed it made him cry."

    "story": [
      "Government borrowing was much higher than expected in October, as debt interest payments hit a record high for the month and public sector pay rises contributed to higher spending.",
      "Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax take - stood at \u00a317.4bn last month, the second highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993.",
      "The borrowing figures are the first to be released since Chancellor Rachel Reeves' first Budget last month, which outlined higher spending and increased taxes.",
      "However, analysts said the worse-than-expected borrowing figure underlined the difficulties the chancellor faced in keeping public finances under control.",
      "The borrowing figures are the latest piece of challenging data for the government.",
      "Inflation figures released on Wednesday showed prices rising faster than expected, while last week it emerged that the economy barely grew between July and September.",
      "In addition, the chancellor has come under pressure from businesses and the farming community to reverse some of the tax increases announced in the Budget.",
      "Questions have also been raised over Reeves' CV, following claims she had embellished some of her past achievements.",

      "\"However, with spending on public services, benefits and debt interest costs all up on last year, expenditure rose faster than revenue overall,\" said Jessica Barnaby of the ONS.",
      "Interest payments on government debt hit \u00a39.1bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1997.",
      "The ONS figures also showed government spending on pay was up \u00a32.2bn from a year earlier, reflecting some of the impact of the latest public sector pay deals.",
      "When Labour came to power it announced above-inflation backdated pay increases for NHS staff and teachers, and these came into effect in October.",
      "Borrowing in the financial year to October has now reached \u00a396.6bn, the ONS said, which is \u00a31.1bn more than at the same point last year.",
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said Labour had inherited a difficult economic situation following the election, and the Budget was aimed at \"fixing the foundations and putting public finances on a sustainable footing\".",
      "\"This government will never play fast and loose with the public finances. Our new robust fiscal rules will deliver stability by getting debt down while prioritising investment to deliver growth.\"",

      "This amount is 97.5% of the size of the UK's economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s.",

      "This new measure of debt - public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) -  was at  83.7% of GDP in October, the ONS said.",

      "The reformed Pistols' shows raised money to help save Cook's local venue in London which was facing closure.",
      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",
      "In the late 1970s the Pistols, as the figureheads of the punk movement, were seen by many as public enemy number one, with their assaults on the music industry, the monarchy - and pretty much everything else.",
      "Now their bassist and main songwriter is focused on ensuring today's bands still have somewhere to play.",
      "\"I was involved with The Musicians' Union,\" he said. \"There was a photocall outside Parliament about the Agent of Change Act, calling for action to protect music venues.",
      "\"Situations like where there's a club and someone builds a block of flats next to it. Then people moan about the noise, when the venue was there first.",
      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",
      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

      "The NHS in England came within \u201csix or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said.",

      "He stated there was never a \u201cnational shortage\u201d of PPE for healthcare workers but \u201cin some places, they did run out - and it was awful\u201d.",
      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",
      "On Thursday, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives.",
      "'Left to die'",
      "Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid.",
      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",
      "He said he felt it was his job to \u201cshield\u201d the health service from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d.",
      "Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added."

      "Burghart called on Rayner to commit to no further increases to inheritance tax or reductions to agricultural property relief during the current Parliament.",

      "On announcing the start of his \"special military operation\" \u2013 the full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 he had issued a warning to \u201cthose who may be tempted to interfere from the outside\u201d.",

      "Western leaders generally dismissed what they saw as nuclear sabre-rattling. Since the start of the war Western governments have crossed several Russian \"red lines\":  providing Ukraine with tanks, advanced missile systems and then F-16 fighter jets.",
      "The \"consequences\" threatened by the Kremlin never materialised.",
      "In September Putin announced he was lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons - the decree was published this week. A clear warning to Europe and America not to allow longer-range missile strikes on Russian territory.",
      "Now this red line, too, has been crossed. In his address to the nation Putin confirmed Western reports that Ukraine had fired US-supplied Atacms and British-made Storm Shadow missiles at targets inside Russia.",
      "Earlier this week, when pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets asked a retired lieutenant-general how Russia should respond to an Atacms attack on Bryansk region, he replied:",
      "\u201cStarting World War Three over strikes on an arms depot in Bryansk region would probably be short-sighted.\u201d",
      "It would be comforting to think that the Kremlin shares that view.",
      "But Vladimir Putin\u2019s address to the nation contained no evidence of that.",
      "His message to Ukraine\u2019s supporters in the West appeared to be: this is a red line I\u2019m serious about, I dare you to cross it.",
      "\u201cEven Putin doesn\u2019t know whether he can use a nuclear weapon, or he can\u2019t. It depends on his emotions,\u201d Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov told me recently.",
      "\u201cWe know he\u2019s a very emotional man. The decision to begin this war was also an emotional step. Because of that we must take seriously his idea of the changing of the nuclear doctrine. They say the fear of war must return and will contain both sides, but this is also a tool of escalation.",
      "\u201cIn this interpretation we must admit that Putin, under some circumstances, can use at least a tactical nuclear weapon in the framework of a limited nuclear war. It will not solve the problem. But it will be the start of a suicidal escalation for the whole world.\u201d",
      "Tactical nuclear weapons are small warheads intended for use on the battlefield or  a limited strike.",

      "John Prescott, who has died aged 86, was a figurehead of New Labour, who was also instinctively sceptical of some of its instincts.",
      "He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off.",
      "His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre.",
      "He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together.",
      "It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer.",
      "Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged.",
      "Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC:  \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\"",
      "She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\"",
      "Speaking to broadcasters after news of his death, Rayner said he had been \"a huge support to me ever since I came into politics\", offering the advice to \"be authentically yourself and keep thinking about the people you\u2019re there to represent\".",
      "She added: \"That\u2019s what he always said to me, 'you\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it'\".",

      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Both left school with few qualifications and worked their way up through the union movement, before entering politics.",
      "And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use.",
      "Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them.",
      "And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for.",
      "The old jibe that all politicians look and sound the same could never apply to Prescott or Rayner.",
      "Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life.",
      "For all the talk about how he was the authentic working class grit in the smooth, polished very middle class New Labour, that sense of his class \u2013 \u201cbottom class\u201d as he put it \u2013 and others was a huge part of how he saw himself, and how he saw others.",

      "Decades later, Tony Blair would reflect that Prescott\u2019s own self image was an ever present in his daily interactions in government.",
      "\u201cHe could smell out condescension, a slight, an air of superiority or a snub at a thousand paces; and at once smelt, he could charge after it with quite shocking abandon.\u201d",

      "John Leslie Prescott was born in Prestatyn, then in Flintshire, on 31 May 1938. His father was a railway signalman and his mother came from a mining family.",
      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",
      "He became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen.",
      "In 1962, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he got a diploma in economics and politics, and later to Hull University to study for an economics degree.",
      "Active in the merchant sailors' strike of 1966, he served as an official with the National Union of Seamen for two years before his election, in 1970, as MP for Hull East, sponsored by the union.",
      "Cherished principles",
      "John Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport.",
      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",
      "But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.",
      "It was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again.",
      "And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years.",
      "When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.",
      "The Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment.",
      "He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car.",
      "This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.",
      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",
      "He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.",
      "Election punch",
      "His policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea.",
      "He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes.",
      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",

      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",

      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",

      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",

      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "summary": "How future talks will play out if another superpower comes to the fore, just as the US steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 01:22:23 GMT",
    "summary": "These caves were unexplored for thousands of years, protected by swirling mists and terrifying tales.",
    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",
      "\u201cWe don't have much time left to start helping the environment. We've done so much to destroy it.\u201d",

    "summary": "The tech is being used to automatically control the creatures' access to feeders at sites across the UK.",
    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool which has been trained to tell the difference between grey and red squirrels could be \"an absolute game changer\", conservationists say.",
      "The system, called Squirrel Agent, has been trained on thousands of images of the animals allowing it to tell them apart with 97% accuracy, its developer says.",
      "It can then be used to automatically control access to squirrel feeders - with only reds being allowed into those containing food, and only greys into those where food has been replaced with contraceptive paste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real showcase of what AI can do,\u201d said Emma McClenaghan, co-founder of Genysys Engine, which developed the tool.",

      "Squirrel Agent is currently being tested in sites around the UK in conjunction with five wildlife charities.",
      "Genysys Engine hopes it will eventually be used much more widely not just with squirrels but with other species which would benefit from sophisticated digital monitoring.",
      "Ian Glendinning, from Northern Red Squirrels - one of the conservation groups involved in the trial - told the BBC that, for the animals he is trying to protect, help from technology was urgently needed.",
      "\u201cWe are in the bar of the last chance saloon, and the landlord has just called last orders,\" he said.",
      "Red peril",
      "Grey squirrels are largely responsible for the huge decline in the numbers of red squirrels.",
      "This is partly because there are so many of them, and also because they can carry a  virus which they have immunity to but is lethal to red squirrels. They arrived in the UK around 200 years ago.",
      "\u201cRed squirrels are hanging on in Scotland and Ireland, and there are some island populations like Anglesey and the Isle of Wight\", explained Mr Glendinning.",
      "\"But mainland England and Wales is in dire straits, and they will become extinct if we are unable to reverse this trend.\"",
      "Efforts to preserve red squirrels are further complicated by the fact that, despite their name, not all red squirrels are red.",
      "There are other markers including their tails, ears, size and weight which can also distinguish them from grey squirrels \u2013 the vastly dominant population - even if they are the same colour.",
      "The detection process is time-consuming for human observers - but Squirrel Agent uses the power of AI to rapidly analyse all those markers and decide with an extremely high level of accuracy which is which.",
      "It can then automatically decide whether to boost their survival chances by allowing them extra food - or reduce their likelihood of reproducing by steering them towards contraceptives.",
      "By a whisker",
      "Genysys Engine says the next step in the evolution of the tech is to go beyond just distinguishing between the types of squirrel and instead identify individual animals.",
      "This will be done, Emma McClenaghan says, by focusing on their whiskers, which are unique to each animal.",
      "\"Whiskers are like a human fingerprints,\" she says.",
      "By distinguishing between each creature\u2019s whisker tips, as well as their base and length, she hopes AI will enable wildlife experts to track and monitor individual members of the population.",
      "\u201cOver time this data will build up, allowing scientists and researchers to start tracking family lines,\u201d she says.",
      "There are already other examples of AI's ability to process huge amounts of data very quickly being useful for conservationists.",
      "For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) used the tech to analyse millions of photographs of a large area of Australia wiped out by bushfires, in order to find places where animals had survived.",

      "Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC the move was \"ambitious\" but it was \"exciting to conquer a new challenge\".",
      "He said: \"Netflix is the gold standard and part of us working with them is to say that over the past decade we've managed to go from filming content in our bedrooms to working with the biggest streaming platform in the world.\"",

      "Passers-by are warned by a sign on each of Spot\u2019s legs: \u201cDO NOT PET.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know that anyone is tempted to pet these robot dogs. They do not look cuddly,\u201d said Melissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College.",
      "Video of Spot strutting around the property has gone viral on TikTok - where reactions range from calling them cool and cute, to creepy - and become fodder for jokes on American late night television. But its mission is no laughing matter.",
      "\u201cSafeguarding the president-elect is a top priority,\u201d said Anthony Guglielmi, US Secret Service chief of communications, in a statement to the BBC.",
      "In the months leading up to the US presidential election, Trump was the target of two apparent assassination attempts. The first took place at a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania and the other occurred at the Mar-a-Lago golf course in September.",
      "Citing \u201cconcern for operational security,\u201d the Secret Service declined to answer the BBC\u2019s specific questions about the use of robotic dogs in Trump\u2019s security detail, including when the agency began deploying the device at his primary residence.",

      "So why might the Secret Service be using them now?",
      "Ron Williams, a former Secret Service agent who is now CEO of the security and risk management firm Talon Companies, suspects the assassination attempts against Trump added urgency to the agency\u2019s push \u201cto upgrade the technology that can enhance the ability to detect and deter,\u201d Williams said.",
      "At Mar-a-Lago, where so much of the property is exposed, Williams said robotic dogs are long overdue. \u201cThey can cover a lot more area\u201d than humans alone, Williams said of the dogs, which he expects will become more of a common sight over time.",

      "Spot is known for its agility. It can walk up and down stairs and navigate tight spaces. It can even open doors.",
      "But its ability to reveal potential threats ranks high among the reasons that so many agencies appear willing to pay up to $75,000 (\u00a359,000) for the device.",
      "Secret Service communications chief Guglielmi said the robotic dogs were \u201cequipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations\u201d.",
      "The device comes outfitted with multiple cameras that generate a 3D map of its surroundings, according to Boston Dynamics marketing materials, and can also have extras such as thermal sensing.",

      "\u201cThey basically have a joystick controlling the robot dog as it walks around,\u201d said Missy Cummings, an engineering professor at George Mason University who runs the university\u2019s Autonomy and Robotics Center. Spot can also move automatically along predefined routes.",

      "\u201cYou just have to spray it with Aqua Net hairspray in its \u2018face\u2019,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAnd that would be enough to stop the cameras from working correctly.\u201d",
      "While the robotic dog seen at Mar-a-Lago is not armed, she says competitors appear to be experimenting with models that are.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",

      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",

      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",

    "summary": "The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win \u2013 but data shows that most voters picked someone else.",
    "story": [
      "Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an \u201cunprecedented and powerful\u201d mandate to govern.",
      "He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall.",
      "Trump\u2019s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda.",
      "He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history.",
      "But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting.",
      "His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a \"landslide\" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues.",
      "\"It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide,\" said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos.",
      "The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House.",
      "That is thanks to America\u2019s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states.",
      "Here are three ways to look at his win.",
      "Most voters picked someone other than Trump",
      "With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC\u2019s US partner, CBS News.",
      "That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004.",
      "But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California.",
      "This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.",
      "In 2024, Trump\u2019s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.",
      "But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.",
      "To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.",
      "For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate \"may be overwrought\", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to \"justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government\".",
      "His electoral college win was resounding",
      "On a different metric, Trump\u2019s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris\u2019s 226.",
      "And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.",
      "The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.",
      "Trump\u2019s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.",
      "And it is important to remember that the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.",
      "If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.",
      "That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.",
      "In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.",
      "But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender.",

      "There is another measure with which to consider Trump\u2019s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.",
      "The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.",
      "It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.",

      "Every night at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT), people have been banging pots and pans in their homes, as they heed Mondlane's call to send a loud message that they reject an extension of Frelimo's 49-year rule.",
      "Mr Samuel said the protest was first held on the night of 15 November when huge numbers of people took to the streets to bang pots, pans and bottles or to blow whistles.",
      "\"It was as though a new Mozambique was being born,\" he added.",
      "But the night ended tragically, with Antonio being among those killed by police, Mr Samuel said.",
      "Since then most people have been carrying out the protest inside their homes, with the sound of banged pots and pans echoing across Maputo at 21:00 every night.",
      "At Antonio's funeral at the S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier Cemetery four days after his killing, one of his friends delivered his mother\u2019s eulogy: \"You were so full of life and hope. Now you are a victim of a bullet.\"",

      "Mozambique\u2019s police commander Bernadino Raphael expressed sympathy with the families of the victims, but deflected responsibility for the deaths, blaming Mondlane's supporters.",
      "\"They are using children as shields in front of them while they remain behind,\" he alleged in a BBC interview.",
      "The commander added that in many instances police had no choice but to defend themselves from protesters who had unleashed violence, including killing six officers and looting and burning property and vehicles.",
      "\"We recorded 103 injured people, 69 of whom were police officers,\" he said.",

      "South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies analyst Borges Nhamirre said this was the first time Mozambique had witnessed so many casualties, and damage to property, during protests.",
      "He said it was clear that Frelimo had lost popularity, especially among young people who were \"looking for jobs, looking for vocational training, looking for a plot to build their house, looking for some money\".",
      "\"They don't care about who brought independence. The independence they want is their financial independence,\" Mr Nhamirre said.",
      "After the result was announced on 24 October, Chapo was adamant that he and Frelimo had won in a free and fair contest, saying: \"We are an organised party that prepares its victories.\"",
      "Since then he has kept a notably low profile, waiting for the courts to rule on Mondlane's bid to annul the result.",

      "With a Mozambican flag laid out on the floor next to burning candles, Alito's friends showed us a photo of him - with what appeared to be a gunshot wound in the back of his head.",

    "summary": "The smugglers offered the migrants bronze, silver, gold and platinum packages, depending on risk.",
    "story": [
      "Two men have pleaded guilty midway through their trial to people smuggling.",
      "Dilshad Shamo, 41, and Ali Khdir, 40, were convicted for their roles in an operation which ran through Europe labelled \"Tripadvisor for people smugglers\".",
      "They brought about 100 migrants illegally to Europe each week, over a period of two years.",
      "The pair - based in a car wash in the south Wales town of Caerphilly - offered the migrants bronze, silver, gold and platinum packages, depending on risk.",
      "A platinum package could get you a flight, whereas silver might land you a \"comfortable ride\" in the back of a lorry.",
      "Migrants from the Middle East heading to Europe rated their journeys in videos filmed inside lorries, boats and even on planes.",
      "\"How was the route, lads?\" a man asks in one clip, as someone at the back of the lorry gives a thumbs-up.",
      "Investigators found the video reviews on the phones of the smugglers themselves, seemingly made as promotional material.",
      "According to the National Crime Agency (NCA), most of the people using their services were from Iran, Iraq and Syria, searching for a better life in western Europe. Many are believed to have come to the UK.",
      "In one video, a migrant said: \"Lorry route agreement with knowledge of the driver; here we have men, women and children - thank God the route was easy and good.\"",
      "Another showed men smiling to the camera as they pointed to at least a dozen others on a boat travelling rapidly over the water.",
      "People smugglers 'like a travel agent'",
      "Derek Evans, from the NCA, said the pair operated \"like a travel agency\".",
      "\"It's like Tripadvisor, they were rating their service within that community,\" he said.",
      "The highest tier offered - platinum - would get migrants a fake passport and air travel, costing between \u00a310,000 and \u00a325,000.",
      "The gold tier would be by vessel costing about \u00a38,000-\u00a310,000, while bronze, the most risky service - between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 - would involve travel in a heavy goods vehicle.",
      "The NCA tracked the smugglers down after a tip-off and secretly recorded some of their phone calls.",
      "\"From last Friday till last night, I have been smuggling people,\" Shamo said in one conversation.",
      "\"A batch every single day, Kurds from Turkey... so this week, I smuggled six to seven batches.\"",
      "Profits unlikely to be recovered",
      "Mr Evans told the BBC Wales Investigates programme that they hope to have \"dismantled and disrupted\" part of the smuggling industry.",
      "But he said there was \"no doubt\" someone else would take over because it was such a \"fruitful business model\".",
      "Shamo and Khdir made hundreds of thousands if not millions of pounds, he said, but the profits were unlikely ever to be recovered.",
      "This is because they used a system known as hawala banking, which does not require detailed information from those using it.",
      "Individuals can deposit money to a hawala broker in one country, and a recipient withdraws it from a broker in another country, using a code.",
      "This means money is transferred without any cash being physically moved. No identification is needed from those using it.",
      "While there are legitimate and even \"essential\" uses for it - such as people without bank accounts sending remittances to their families abroad - it is also a system that is \"attractive for criminal activity\", said Claire Healy, of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).",
      "On the trail of the smuggling gangs",
      "We knew that from their car wash in south Wales, Shamo and Khdir had contacts in Iraq as a key part of their smuggling operation.",
      "So we travelled to the city of Erbil and enlisted the help of a local man with knowledge of smuggling gangs to find out more about the shady but hugely profitable smuggling industry.",
      "He quickly found adverts on TikTok offering a similar service to the men from Caerphilly, but they were unlikely to talk openly about illegal activity.",
      "So we went undercover, sending our contact in to pose as an Iraqi man looking to reach the UK.",
      "One smuggler said he could arrange for us to be taken from France to the UK in the back of a lorry for $5,000 (\u00a33,900).",
      "Another man, who called himself Bawar, claimed to be based in Cardiff and offered a more comfortable trip, with a fake passport.",
      "\"My brother, we have by plane from France to Britain... we guarantee no stoppage or fingerprinting,\" he told us.",
      "\"The amount is $8,000 (\u00a36,200) and you can easily deposit the amount in any transfer office you want.\"",
      "To finalise the deal, Bawar told us to deposit the money at a hawala in Erbil.",
      "When our undercover reporter arrived there, the man running it appeared familiar with the arrangement. We confirmed we were travelling by plane with documents provided by Bawar.",
      "\"OK, fine. You must know that the [hawala] fee is \u00a3400,\" he replied.",
      "We did not go through with the deal, but it appeared to illustrate how easily the hawala banking system is being exploited by smugglers.",
      "When the BBC approached Bawar for comment, he denied being involved in smuggling, claiming he was a shepherd who had no money.",
      "The hawala owner in Erbil denied offering to take money to help our undercover reporter travel to the UK on a false passport.",
      "Mr Evans, from the NCA, said only some of the known hawalas in the UK were registered with the financial authorities, while many others were working within a criminal network.",
      "But not enough was being done to identify how this kind of banking was exploited by smugglers and other criminals, said Dr Healy.",
      "\"I think a lot of countries are struggling in their responses because they really don't understand the system.",
      "\"Very often it's simply the person driving a boat or driving a car who gets arrested... these are actors who are very easily replaceable.\"",
      "Dr Healy said more financial expertise was required to locate the criminals making big profits, and further work was needed to regulate hawalas to flag suspicious transactions, while ensuring legitimate business cold continue.",
      "\"It's also extremely urgent - we've seen around the world, including the UK, the dangerous conditions in which smuggling happens and the lives that are lost.\"",
      "A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC it had \"zero tolerance for content that promotes human smuggling\" and would remove accounts that break its rules.",
      "It said it worked with the NCA to \"identify and combat organised immigration crime online and respond to evolving threats\".",
      "The UK government, having pledged to freeze the bank accounts of smugglers, said it would \"stop at nothing to dismantle vile people smuggling gangs\".",

      "\u201cThese transfers are fuelling Putin\u2019s war machine \u2013 this is oil for missiles, oil for artillery and now oil for soldiers,\u201d says Hugh Griffiths, who led the panel from 2014 to 2019.",
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has told the BBC in a statement: \u201cTo keep fighting in Ukraine, Russia has become increasingly reliant on North Korea for troops and weapons in exchange for oil.\"",
      "He added that this was \u201chaving a direct impact on security in the Korean peninsula, Europe and Indo-Pacific\".",
      "Easy and cheap oil supply",
      "While most people in North Korea rely on coal for their daily lives, oil is essential for running the country\u2019s military. Diesel and petrol are used to transport missile launchers and troops around the country, run munitions factories and fuel the cars of Pyongyang\u2019s elite.",
      "The 500,000 barrels North Korea is allowed to receive fall far short of the nine million it consumes \u2013 meaning that since the cap was introduced in 2017, the country has been forced to buy oil illicitly from criminal networks to make up this deficit.",
      "This involves transferring the oil between ships out at sea \u2013 a risky, expensive and time-consuming business, according to Dr Go Myong-hyun, a senior research fellow at South Korea\u2019s Institute for National Security Strategy, which is linked to the country\u2019s spy agency.",

      "\u201cThe vessels appear silently, almost every week,\u201d says Joe Byrne, the researcher from the Open Source Centre. \u201cSince March there\u2019s been a fairly constant flow.\u201d",
      "The team, which has been tracking these tankers since the oil sanctions were first introduced, used their knowledge of each ship\u2019s capacity to calculate how many oil barrels they could carry.",
      "Then they studied images of the ships entering and leaving Vostochny and, in most instances, could see how low they sat in the water and, therefore, how full they were.",

      "\u201cWe can see from some of the images that if the ships were any fuller they would sink,\u201d Mr Byrne says.",
      "Based on this, they calculate that, since March, Russia has given North Korea more than a million barrels of oil - more than double the annual cap, and around ten times the amount Moscow officially gave Pyongyang in 2023.",
      "This follows an assessment by the US government in May that Moscow had already supplied more than 500,000 barrels\u2019 worth of oil.",

      "Not only do these oil deliveries breach UN sanctions on North Korea, that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, signed off on \u2013 but also, more than half of the journeys tracked by the Open Source Centre were made by vessels that have been individually sanctioned by the UN.",
      "This means they should have been impounded upon entering Russian waters.",
      "But in March 2024, three weeks after the first oil transfer was documented, Russia disbanded the UN panel responsible for monitoring sanctions violations, by using its veto at the UN Security Council.",

      "\u201cWe were tracking some of the ships and companies involved, but our work was stopped, possibly after they had already breached the 500,000-barrel cap\u201d.",

      "\u201cNow the panel is gone, they can simply ignore the rules,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe fact that Russia is now encouraging these ships to visit its ports and load up with oil shows a new level of contempt for these sanctions.\u201d",
      "But Mr Penton-Voak, who is on the board of the Open Source Centre, thinks the problem runs much deeper.",

      "It was a nomination that stunned Washington and sent a shiver through the corridors of the justice department.",
      "Trump settled on Gaetz, 42, during a two-hour flight from Washington to Florida last week, according to reports.",
      "Still basking in the glow of his election victory, the president-elect was flying back to West Palm Beach last Wednesday afternoon after a cordial meeting with President Joe Biden.",
      "That morning Gaetz was not even on the shortlist for the position of America\u2019s top law officer, according to Politico, but Trump had felt underwhelmed by his other options.",
      "A plan hatched on a plane",
      "On so-called Trump Force One that day were Gaetz himself, Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn, reports the New York Times.",
      "Epshteyn reportedly set about convincing Trump that Gaetz should lead the justice department, which had conducted a sex-trafficking investigation into the lawmaker before dropping the matter.",
      "The allegation that Gaetz had sex with a minor, which he denies, was set to dominate and probably torpedo his nomination process.",
      "Losing his first choice is a setback to Trump and shows the reluctance of the Senate in ushering through a man who has no shortage of enemies in Congress.",
      "The woman Trump has picked instead, another Floridian Pam Bondi, would seem to have more allies and a smoother path ahead.",
      "Gaetz, a lawyer, has been one of Trump\u2019s most strident defenders on Capitol Hill.",
      "He helped prepare the Republican nominee for his televised debate against Biden that effectively knocked the Democrat out of the White House race.",
      "One Trump adviser explained why the president-elect - who has himself been criminally investigated by the justice department, and accuses its prosecutors of witch hunts - took a shine to Gaetz as opposed to other contenders.",
      "\u201cEveryone else looked at AG [attorney general] as if they were applying for a judicial appointment,\u201d the unnamed aide told the Bulwark.",

      "Prosecutors outraged",
      "While Republicans on Capitol Hill reacted tepidly to the nomination, career lawyers at the justice department told US media they were stunned and outraged.",
      "Speaking at a conservative conference last year, Gaetz had suggested that the justice department and the agencies it oversees, including the FBI, ought to be abolished, as he argued they were being weaponised against conservatives. The current Attorney General, Merrick Garland, has rejected these claims.",
      "Critics said Trump - who has also named three lawyers that defended him in criminal cases for senior positions at the justice department - was more interested in hiring loyalists than appointees who will uphold the rule of law.",
      "Former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton dismissed Gaetz as the \u201cworst cabinet-level appointment in history\u201d.",
      "But the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, said the furore from the Washington establishment showed his father\u2019s unconventional cabinet picks were just the kind of change-makers that American voters had elected him to usher in.",
      "A ticking timebomb",
      "After being nominated last week for attorney general, Gaetz resigned as representative for Florida's 1st congressional district, a seat he has held since 2017.",
      "His resignation came as the House Ethics Committee was due to decide whether to release a report on its investigation into allegations of misconduct involving drugs, bribes and paying for sex, including with an underage girl.",
      "Gaetz dismissed the claims as a smear. But his resignation triggered a drip feed of leaks in subsequent days as the ethics panel wrangled over what to do about the report.",
      "Few Republicans seemed willing, meanwhile, to circle the wagons round one of the most unpopular lawmakers in the House.",
      "Last year, the combative Gaetz came under fire from his own side of the aisle when he proved instrumental in ousting Republican Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker.",
      "Markwayne Mullin, a former House member turned senator, told CNN at the time there was a reason why none of Gaetz\u2019s colleagues would defend him from allegations of sexual misconduct.",
      "\"Because we had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor,\" said the Oklahoman last October, accusing Gaetz of bragging about his sexual exploits.",
      "Gaetz said Mullin was lying.",
      "A confirmation 'on steroids'",
      "As the backlash to his nomination for attorney general began to build this week, Trump made calls to senators in an effort to shore up support.",
      "Trump seemed to be holding firm on Gaetz as he attended a SpaceX rocket launch in Boca Chica, Texas, on Tuesday with Musk.",
      "Asked if he was reconsidering, the president-elect said: \"No.\"",
      "There was more encouraging news for Gaetz on Wednesday as House Ethics Committee Republicans voted not to release its investigation into him.",
      "It happened as Vice-President-elect JD Vance ferried the attorney general nominee around the Senate in a charm offensive.",
      "Gaetz said it had been \u201ca great day\u201d. But there were hints of turbulence ahead.",
      "When asked how messy the confirmation process could become, incoming Senate majority leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said the hearings could be \u201con steroids\u201d.",
      "A successor is swiftly picked",
      "On Thursday morning, Trump was still calling Republican senators to gauge Gaetz's chances.",
      "But by lunchtime, the nominee had come to the conclusion he didn't have the votes and he again shocked Washington with the announcement that he was showing himself the door.",
      "\u201cWhile the momentum was strong,\u201d he posted on X, \u201cit is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social confirming the volte-face - his first political setback since his election 16 days earlier - was unusually muted for the president-elect.",
      "\u201cI greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General,\u201d he wrote, adding that the nominee did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d.",
      "Hours later, Trump nominated former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi instead for the post.",
      "While Trump predicted a \"wonderful future\" for Gaetz, a question mark hangs over what he will do next.",
      "He was comfortably re-elected this month, but there are already plans for a special election to fill his vacated seat.",
      "Randy Ross, a Florida-based fundraiser for Trump, told the BBC that America had not heard the last of Matt Gaetz.",
      "\u201cMy opinion is there\u2019s still a spot in Trump\u2019s administration, Florida or our country\u2019s future leadership for this patriot,\" said Mr Ross. \"We all look forward to his next steps.\"",

    "title": "China's giant sinkholes are a tourist hit - but ancient forests inside are at risk",
    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 01:22:23 GMT",
    "summary": "These caves were unexplored for thousands of years, protected by swirling mists and terrifying tales.",
    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "How future talks will play out if another superpower comes to the fore, just as the US steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "summary": "The video went viral after one of India's top designers Sabyasachi Mukherjee shared it.",
    "story": [
      "A video of a fashion shoot in India has gone viral and unexpectedly turned a group of underprivileged school children into local celebrities.",
      "The footage shows the children, most of them girls between the ages of 12 and 17, dressed in red and gold outfits fashioned from discarded clothes.",
      "The teenagers designed and tailored the outfits and also doubled up as models to showcase their creations, with the grubby walls and terraces of the slum providing the backdrop for their ramp walk.",
      "The video was filmed and edited by a 15-year-old boy.",
      "The video first appeared earlier this month on the Instagram page of Innovation for Change, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the city of Lucknow.",
      "The charity works with about 400 children from the city's slums, providing them free food, education and job skills. The children featured in the shoot are students of this NGO.",
      "Mehak Kannojia, one of the models in the video, told the BBC that she and her fellow students closely followed the sartorial choices of Bollywood actresses on Instagram and often duplicated some of their outfits for themselves.",
      "\"This time, we decided to pool our resources and worked as a group,\" the 16-year-old said.",
      "For their project, they chose wisely - a campaign by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, one of India's top fashion designers who has dressed Bollywood celebrities, Hollywood actresses and billionaires. In 2018, Kim Kardashian wore his sequinned red sari for a Vogue shoot.",
      "Mukherjee is also known as the \"king of weddings\" in India. He has dressed  thousands of brides, including Bollywood celebrities such as Anushka Sharma and Deepika Padukone. Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in a stunning red Sabyasachi outfit.",
      "Mehak said their project, called Yeh laal rang (the colour red), was inspired by the designer's heritage bridal collection.",
      "\"We sifted through the clothes that had come to us in donation and picked out all the red items. Then we zeroed in on the outfits we wanted to make and began putting them together.\"",
      "It was intense work - the girls stitched about a dozen outfits in three-four days but, Mehak says, they had \"great fun doing it\".",
      "For the ramp walk, Mehak says they studied the models carefully in Sabyasachi videos and copied their moves.",
      "\"Just like his models, some of us wore sunglasses, one drank from a sipper with a straw, while another walked carrying a cloth bundle under her arm.\"",
      "Some of it, Mehak says, came together organically. \"At one point in the shoot, I was supposed to laugh. At that moment, someone said something funny and I just burst out laughing.\"",
      "It was an ambitious project, but the result has won hearts in India. Put together on a shoestring budget with donated clothes, the video went viral after Mukherjee reposted it on his Instagram feed with a heart emoji.",
      "The campaign won widespread praise, with many on social media comparing their work to that of professionals.",
      "The viral video has brought enormous attention to the charity and its school has been visited by several TV channels, some of the children were invited to participate in shows on popular FM radio stations and Bollywood actress Tamannah Bhatia visited them to accept a scarf from the children.",
      "The response, Mehak says, has been \"totally unexpected\".",
      "\"It feels like a dream come true. All my friends are sharing the video and saying 'you've become famous'. My parents were full of joy when they heard about all the attention we are getting.",
      "\"We are feeling wonderful. Now we have only one dream left - to meet Sabyasachi.\"",
      "The shoot, however, also received criticism, with some wondering if showing young girls dressed as brides could encouraged child marriage in a country where millions of girls are still married off by their families before they turn 18 - the legal age.",
      "The Innovation for Change addressed the concern in a post on Instagram, saying they had no intention to encourage child marriage.",
      "\"Our aim is not to promote child marriage in any way. Today, these girls are able to do something like this by fighting against such ideas and restrictions. Please appreciate them, otherwise the morale of these children will fall.\""

      "Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, his decision to declare four Ukrainian territories part of Russia, his deployment of North Korean troops to Kursk region, his decision on Thursday to target the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile, followed up by threats to strike the West - all of these represent moments of escalation in this conflict.",

      "Don\u2019t expect the Putinmobile to suddenly decelerate or de-escalate now in the face of longer-range missile strikes on Russia.",
      "Escalation, though, is another matter. That\u2019s a distinct possibility.",

Because of that we must take seriously his idea of the changing of the nuclear doctrine. They say the fear of war must return and will contain both sides, but this is also a tool of escalation.",
      "\u201cIn this interpretation we must admit that Putin, under some circumstances, can use at least a tactical nuclear weapon in the framework of a limited nuclear war. It will not solve the problem. But it will be the start of a suicidal escalation for the whole world.\u201d",

    "summary": "The deaths of five tourists after apparently drinking tainted drinks highlight the wider issue of bootleg alcohol.",
    "story": [
      "Suspected methanol poisoning from tainted drinks has reportedly killed six tourists in a Laos holiday town in the past fortnight.",
      "A British woman, two Australian women, a US man and two Danish nationals have died. The deaths remain under police investigation, but reports suggest they may have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulation in food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml or half a shot can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It mainly affects poorer countries- outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as the hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",
      "\"You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 it\u2019s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent,\" one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.",
      "They said methanol poisonings were frequently reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",
      "\"I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists - that's not good for them or their industry either,\" the diplomat said.",
      "\"It's more about the production side \u2013 there being being low education, low regulation, people cutting corners.\"",
      "What can be done about it?",
      "Some campaigners have sought to raise attention to the dangers before. Australian man Colin Ahearn runs a Facebook page called 'Don't Drink Spirits in Bali' where he warns against mixed drinks like cocktails or drinks made from opened bottles of spirits.",
      "He told Australian media earlier this week that his page used to receive a submission a week about methanol poisoning across South East Asia.",
      "The diplomat said the risks of bootleg alcohol are well known among tourism operators and embassies, but a high-profile campaign is needed to inform tourists.",
      "\"This horrific event will probably help educate people, but not solve the cause of the problem,\u201d they added.",

      "Eight tumultuous days after US President-elect Donald Trump picked Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, the firebrand congressman has withdrawn from consideration for the post.",
      "It was a nomination that stunned Washington and sent a shiver through the corridors of the justice department.",
      "Trump settled on Gaetz, 42, during a two-hour flight from Washington to Florida last week, according to reports.",
      "Still basking in the glow of his election victory, the president-elect was flying back to West Palm Beach last Wednesday afternoon after a cordial meeting with President Joe Biden.",
      "That morning Gaetz was not even on the shortlist for the position of America\u2019s top law officer, according to Politico, but Trump had felt underwhelmed by his other options.",
      "A plan hatched on a plane",
      "On so-called Trump Force One that day were Gaetz himself, Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn, reports the New York Times.",
      "Epshteyn reportedly set about convincing Trump that Gaetz should lead the justice department, which had conducted a sex-trafficking investigation into the lawmaker before dropping the matter.",
      "The allegation that Gaetz had sex with a minor, which he denies, was set to dominate and probably torpedo his nomination process.",
      "Losing his first choice is a setback to Trump and shows the reluctance of the Senate in ushering through a man who has no shortage of enemies in Congress.",
      "The woman Trump has picked instead, another Floridian Pam Bondi, would seem to have more allies and a smoother path ahead.",
      "Gaetz, a lawyer, has been one of Trump\u2019s most strident defenders on Capitol Hill.",
      "He helped prepare the Republican nominee for his televised debate against Biden that effectively knocked the Democrat out of the White House race.",
      "One Trump adviser explained why the president-elect - who has himself been criminally investigated by the justice department, and accuses its prosecutors of witch hunts - took a shine to Gaetz as opposed to other contenders.",
      "\u201cEveryone else looked at AG [attorney general] as if they were applying for a judicial appointment,\u201d the unnamed aide told the Bulwark.",

      "Speaking at a conservative conference last year, Gaetz had suggested that the justice department and the agencies it oversees, including the FBI, ought to be abolished, as he argued they were being weaponised against conservatives. The current Attorney General, Merrick Garland, has rejected these claims.",
      "Critics said Trump - who has also named three lawyers that defended him in criminal cases for senior positions at the justice department - was more interested in hiring loyalists than appointees who will uphold the rule of law.",
      "Former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton dismissed Gaetz as the \u201cworst cabinet-level appointment in history\u201d.",
      "But the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, said the furore from the Washington establishment showed his father\u2019s unconventional cabinet picks were just the kind of change-makers that American voters had elected him to usher in.",
      "A ticking timebomb",
      "After being nominated last week for attorney general, Gaetz resigned as representative for Florida's 1st congressional district, a seat he has held since 2017.",
      "His resignation came as the House Ethics Committee was due to decide whether to release a report on its investigation into allegations of misconduct involving drugs, bribes and paying for sex, including with an underage girl.",
      "Gaetz dismissed the claims as a smear. But his resignation triggered a drip feed of leaks in subsequent days as the ethics panel wrangled over what to do about the report.",
      "Few Republicans seemed willing, meanwhile, to circle the wagons round one of the most unpopular lawmakers in the House.",
      "Last year, the combative Gaetz came under fire from his own side of the aisle when he proved instrumental in ousting Republican Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker.",
      "Markwayne Mullin, a former House member turned senator, told CNN at the time there was a reason why none of Gaetz\u2019s colleagues would defend him from allegations of sexual misconduct.",
      "\"Because we had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor,\" said the Oklahoman last October, accusing Gaetz of bragging about his sexual exploits.",
      "Gaetz said Mullin was lying.",

      "Asked if he was reconsidering, the president-elect said: \"No.\"",
      "There was more encouraging news for Gaetz on Wednesday as House Ethics Committee Republicans voted not to release its investigation into him.",
      "It happened as Vice-President-elect JD Vance ferried the attorney general nominee around the Senate in a charm offensive.",
      "Gaetz said it had been \u201ca great day\u201d. But there were hints of turbulence ahead.",
      "When asked how messy the confirmation process could become, incoming Senate majority leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said the hearings could be \u201con steroids\u201d.",

      "\u201cWhile the momentum was strong,\u201d he posted on X, \u201cit is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social confirming the volte-face - his first political setback since his election 16 days earlier - was unusually muted for the president-elect.",
      "\u201cI greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General,\u201d he wrote, adding that the nominee did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d.",
      "Hours later, Trump nominated former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi instead for the post.",
      "While Trump predicted a \"wonderful future\" for Gaetz, a question mark hangs over what he will do next.",
      "He was comfortably re-elected this month, but there are already plans for a special election to fill his vacated seat.",
      "Randy Ross, a Florida-based fundraiser for Trump, told the BBC that America had not heard the last of Matt Gaetz.",
      "\u201cMy opinion is there\u2019s still a spot in Trump\u2019s administration, Florida or our country\u2019s future leadership for this patriot,\" said Mr Ross. \"We all look forward to his next steps.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Ginger Gaetz, who wed the congressman in 2021, posted an old photo on X following his withdrawal of them both on the steps on Capitol Hill.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:16:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The churches central to his election in 2022 are now his fiercest critics.",
    "story": [
      "William Ruto, who became Kenya\u2019s president two years ago riding on the crest of the Christian vote, has been visibly shaken to find that over the last few months church leaders of all creeds are losing faith in him - seeing him less as a saviour and more as the greedy biblical tax collector.",
      "In the run-up to his victory, some of his most ardent evangelical supporters had dubbed him \"David\", after the shepherd boy in the Bible who rose to become king.",
      "The opposition had baptised him \"deputy Jesus\", accusing him of using Christianity to gain political capital as he attended church services from Catholic masses to the gatherings of obscure sects.",
      "He would wear the appropriate religious attire for each setting, sometimes knelt in supplication and on occasion was moved to tears by sermons.",
      "Afterwards, he credited God for his electoral success, and continued this practice of criss-crossing the country to attend a different church each Sunday.",
      "But following massive opposition to the tax hikes imposed by his government, the 57-year-old gained a new nickname: \"Zakayo\" - which is Swahili for Zacchaeus, the wealthy and unpopular Jericho tax collector featured in the Bible.",
      "The president has always maintained that if people want better public services and a reduction in the country\u2019s debt burden, they have to pay up.",
      "Over the last two years, taxes on salaries have gone up, the sales tax on fuel has doubled and people are also paying a new housing levy and a health insurance tax that is yet to benefit many Kenyans.",
      "When momentous anti-tax protests erupted in June, the young people who led them, popularly referred to as Gen Zs, also called out churches for being too close to politicians and allowing them to preach from their pulpits.",
      "Their anger forced the government to retract a controversial finance bill that had included more tax increases - and it woke up the churches, whose clergy began to openly criticise Ruto and his policies.",
      "This too was a momentous development as the faith economy is big business in a country where more than 80% of the population are Christian - and a fundraiser with the right politician can greatly improve the fortunes of a church.",
      "Last month, Teresia Wairimu, founder of Faith Evangelistic Ministries (Fem), a church in the capital, Nairobi, where Ruto and his family have frequently worshipped, suggested their King David was heading back to the field where sheep grazed.",
      "\"As a voter, I\u2019m embarrassed,\" she said in her sermon.",
      "Another sermon by Rev Tony Kiama of the River of God Church recently went viral after he called out Ruto\u2019s government for \"not serving God\u2019s purpose but an evil one\", citing the killings during the recent protests, the rising cost of living and every-day corruption.",
      "The most hard-hitting criticism was last week\u2019s statement from Catholic bishops, who carry more weight because of the respect and influence they command in Kenya.",
      "They accused Ruto\u2019s government of perpetuating a \"culture of lies\", citing unfulfilled campaign promises.",
      "\"Basically, it seems that truth does not exist, and if it does, it is only what the government says,\" the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops said, also hitting out at corruption, greed and over-taxation that was stifling the economy.",
      "One bishop dubbed Kenya an \"Orwellian dystopian authoritarian\" state, where dissent was met \u201cwith intimidation, abduction or even assassination\".",
      "This was a pointed reference to the 60 people who died and the 1,300 others arrested during the anti-tax demonstrations. A further 74 people have been abducted and 26 reported missing in the last five months, according to the state-run Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.",
      "The stinging statement by the bishops was followed by the Church\u2019s rejection of a $40,000 (\u00a332,000) donation make by Ruto when he attended the Soweto Catholic Church in Nairobi last Sunday - with the Archbishop of Nairobi citing \"ethical concerns and the need to safeguard the Church from being used for political purposes\".",
      "Many of Kenya\u2019s Christians are Catholic - about 10 million people, or 20% of the population, according to government statistics.",
      "Other Christians belong to a variety of evangelical churches and other denominations, including the Anglican Church of Kenya and the Presbyterian Church.",
      "And the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in Kenya goes beyond its congregation owing to its wide investment in education, healthcare and other social programmes.",
      "It has also been angered by the chaotic transition to a new social health insurance scheme, with the government owing millions of dollars to faith-based hospitals.",
      "The bishops\u2019 outspoken assessment of the state of the nation has reminded Kenyans of the role church leaders played when they pushed for a return to multi-party democracy in the 1990s.",
      "Brave clerics such as Ndingi Mwana a\u2019Nzeki of the Catholic Church, Alexander Muge, Henry Okullu and David Gitari of the Anglican Church and Timothy Njoya of the Presbyterian Church fearlessly challenged the repressive and single-party rule of then-President Daniel arap Moi.",
      "But analysts say under Moi\u2019s successors - Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta, both Catholics - clerics lost their voice.",
      "\"Under President William Ruto, things got even worse because important elements of the church were seemingly co-opted into the feeding trough,\" veteran journalist and columnist Macharia Gaitho wrote in Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper this week, suggesting \"churches were bribed into silence\".",
      "The Catholic bishops\u2019 stance has won support from other denominations, as well as Muslim clerics  - despite the widespread faith-based support Ruto enjoyed previously for his tough stand on gay rights and his conservative views on abortion.",
      "A joint statement by some Pentecostal and evangelical leaders hailed the bishops for their bravery and also for \"doing the unthinkable\" in rejecting Ruto\u2019s money.",
      "Head of the Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit, who led national prayers on the day Ruto was declared winner of the presidential race, joined Catholic bishops in condemning what he described as \"escalating misrule, impunity, and widespread rights violations\".",
      "\"In the circumstances, we should not simply fold our hands and pray for miracles,\" Ole Sapit said, adding that the Catholic bishops reflected the feelings of many Kenyans.",
      "Baptist cleric Daniel Wambua added that religious leaders were now determined to end the \"transactional relationship\" with the state.",
      "Meanwhile Sheikh Abubakar Bini, chair of the North Rift Council of Imams and Preachers of Islam, urged the government to take the bishops' remarks as advice rather than criticism.",
      "At first, Ruto and his allies hit back - one accusing the bishops of spreading \"misinformation\".",
      "But analysts say Ruto, who frequently uses the scriptures to respond to critics, should be wary of a direct confrontation with the churches as even smaller ones can have thousands of followers who could negatively affect his re-election bid.",
      "The president is already facing rebellion in parts of his 2022 political strongholds after the impeachment of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua last month.",
      "They fell out over the handling of the anti-tax demonstrations, which have rocked Ruto\u2019s administration to its core.",
      "A close ally of the president, MP Oscar Sudi, has taken to X to eat some humble pie, apologising to Catholic bishops on behalf of the government.",
      "Ruto himself has since appeared to soften his response to the growing criticism, saying he has heard the clerics and is ready to engage further.",
      "\"We have made undeniable progress in our country. However, there remains much to be done. We must continue working together to hasten the delivery of our commitments and change Kenya,\" he tweeted on Thursday.",

    "summary": "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant,\" has died at age 83.",
    "story": [
      "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Guthrie announced the death on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records label.",
      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

    "story": [
      "The original Gladiator debuted nearly 25 years ago, winning five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Now, director Ridley Scott is returning to ancient Rome with the long-awaited sequel, \"Gladiator II\" which hits theaters Friday.",
      "The film stars Denzel Washington,\u00a0\u00a0Connie Nielsen, and Pedro Pascal in a story set in the same brutal Roman Empire \u2014one that didn't leave Scott's mind in the years since its first release.",
      "\"Well, since 'Gladiator' one, I made 17 big movies. I was quite busy,\" Scott said.",
      "But he admitted, \"During that time, I kept thinking, well, we should be doing 'Gladiator II.'\"",
      "A new hero in the arena",
      "Scott brings a fresh take on the same empire fans loved in the first movie.",
      "In the original film, Russell Crowe played Maximus, a general-turned-gladiator battling for honor. This time, the spotlight is on Irish actor Paul Mescal, who stars as a slave fighting for his freedom in the same empire.",
      "Scott, who studied art before becoming a filmmaker, started crafting the sequel's storyboards before the script was even complete.",
      "\"I'm already thinking \u2026 images. I'm drawing as [the writer] is writing. So when I enter on the set, I've already pre-planned everything,\" Scott said. \"It's very efficient because we did 'Gladiator' in 51 days.\"",
      "The sequel opens with an ambitious attack scene involving three full-scale Roman ships.",
      "\"I'm going to make three full-scale real ships,\" Scott said, explaining how they were mounted on massive industrial movers. \"Each trolley is about 100 feet long.\"",
      "While Scott embraces old-school filmmaking, he's also excited about modern tools like CGI.",
      "While Gladiator II features thrilling battles, Scott says the film also explores timeless themes and reflects on the constants of human nature, cruelty and violence.",
      "\"It reminds you that Rome would have Christians walked into that arena and eaten alive. Men, women, and children\u2014for fun,\" he said. \"What on earth was in the minds of Romans in that particular point? And have we come very far away from that? It's extraordinary that's still happening. We don't learn by history.\"",
      "The challenge of a sequel",
      "At 86, Scott admitted it was daunting to follow up on his original masterpiece. \"In a funny kind of way, I feel like I'm in a sport. It is competitive,\" he said. \"You're fighting yourself and your own fear and your own insecurity.\"",
      "When asked about his favorite part of the movie, Scott said, \"I think I'm relieved it is so embraced. And so I'm the favorite as the whole movie. It's pretty good.\"",

      "Despite that early success, Lynne's private life was weighed down by a secret and family tragedy. Coming up in Nashville in the late 1980s, Lynne had to hide the fact that she was gay. She also kept her family history in the shadows. In 1986, she lost both her parents when her father shot and killed her mother and then turned the gun on himself.",

    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",
      "\"That's what I've been asking ever since I met you guys,\" Simon added with a smile.",

    "summary": "For years, actor and comedian Katt Williams has claimed he lied about his age as a teenager to join the Marines and passed boot camp before being drummed out. The Marines have no record of him ever serving.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 Katt Williams, the Emmy-winning actor and renowned stand-up comedian, for years has claimed to have joined the U.S. Marine Corps as a teenager and successfully navigated the rigorous training only to be drummed out of the military when his superiors discovered he was a minor. The Marines told CBS News they have no record of him.",
      "Dating back to at least 2016, Williams has claimed association with the U.S. Marine Corps when talking about his personal biography in video blogs, in his stand-up routines and in interviews viewed and heard by tens of millions of people. His claims of military service seem to not be attached to any of his critically acclaimed jokes or characters he has created for stage and screen but instead, a part of his journey towards comedy.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps tells CBS News there's no record of Williams ever entering military service or attending any Marine Corps recruit training camps.",
      "Multiple emails and phone calls were sent to Williams' publicist, Amy Sisoyev, and his representatives at Creative Artists Agency, but no reply was returned for almost two weeks.",
      "Earlier this year, Williams sat down for a nearly 3-hour interview with ESPN's \"First Take\" correspondent Shannon Sharpe on his podcast, \"Club Shay Shay.\" The interview has racked up\u00a0more than 83 million views on YouTube as of publication and is the most watched interview in YouTube's history.",
      "Sharpe, a former Denver Bronco and ex-NFL analyst for CBS Sports, asked Williams about being raised in Florida.",
      "\"I try to join the Marine Corps and they won't accept me because I'm too young, and I've lied and told them I'm 16 and my family is moving down and I don't have my ID but it's coming. And so they [the Marines] let me go to the boot camp,\" said Williams.",
      "Similarly, on comedian Marc Maron's podcast last year, Williams said, \"And then I attempt to join the Marine Corps, and I go off to boot camp and I pass, and then they reveal that I'm too young, and they give me a little ceremony because I did pass, you know, oo-Rah.\"",
      "He added: \"I wasn't even 16. I wasn't even 16. I was already \u2014 I had miscalculated it wrong. I thought that you know, by the time I got back I would be good, but I hadn't turned 16 by the time boot camp was over.\"",
      "Maron, whose \"WTF\" podcast garners more than 55 million listens per year, asked Williams if he got through boot camp and about his ceremony.",
      "Williams reaffirmed that he passed boot camp, saying, \"When you come back everybody gets the ceremony and I was supposed to have been, probably put in the brig or court-martialed or something, but they didn't treat me like that. \u2026 As far as the Marine Corps thing, whatever those commercials were selling, you remember those commercials back in that time \u2026 if you wanted to join a gang, the Marines was the gang to join.\"",
      "On Saturday, CBS News attended the Vulture Festival in Los Angeles where Williams was interviewed about his life and career by Jesse David Fox, a Vulture writer and host of \"Good One: The Podcast About Jokes.\" Williams is set to launch his multistate \"Heaven on Earth\" tour next year.",
      "While Williams did not discuss his alleged short stint in the Marines, the comedian said \"Thank God I tell the truth\" when asked by Fox about his past statements in interviews.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records pertaining to Williams' alleged enlistment in the Marine Corps.",
      "Marine Corps officials searched for records pertaining to Williams using his full name \u2014 Micah Sierra Williams \u2014 and other identifying information such as his date of birth and social security number. Officials told CBS News that their database of official military personnel files dates back to the 1960s, housed at the National Personnel Records Center of the National Archives.",
      "\"We searched the files maintained by the Manpower Management Performance Branch but were unable to identify Mr. Williams as a member or former member of the U.S. Marine Corps,\" wrote an official in response to CBS News' public records request.",
      "Marine Corps officials told CBS News that if Williams' story was accurate, there would be records showing his entry into military service, his graduation and discharge, even if he fraudulently enlisted as a minor.",
      "Army veteran Anthony Anderson, who runs \"Guardians of Valor,\" a popular social media website that investigates service member records, told CBS News that Williams' claims are a \"slap in the face of people who have earned the title of Marine.\"",
      "\"Boot camp for the Marine Corps is not an easy task. To call yourself a Marine, you have to go through at least 13 weeks of boot camp and successfully navigate the crucible \u2026 people have died in training at boot camp trying to earn the title of Marine,\" said Anderson.",
      "While it's unclear when exactly Williams began to claim he graduated from Marine boot camp, the earliest examples CBS News could find stemmed from Williams' 2016 feud with actor and comedian Kevin Hart.",
      "In a video that appears to have been\u00a0recorded by Williams, addressing drug abuse allegations, the comedian says, \"Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps, I can only breathe out of one nostril.\"",
      "That same year, Williams was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and battery charges after a fight at an apartment complex in Gainesville, Georgia, with a 17-year-old high school wrestler who was also charged, according to previous news reports. Williams pleaded not guilty and the case lingered on until earlier this year when local prosecutors decided to drop the case against Williams.",
      "Soon after his arrest Williams spoke about the episode on stage, suggesting that he wasn't actually put into a chokehold by the teenager and in fact, that Williams had let him win, adding, \"I'm Semper Fi till I die, Marine Corps b----. I passed motherf---ing boot camp at 16.\"",
      "Williams' routine was removed from YouTube due to copyright infringement issues, but the video still exists in the reader forum on Military.com, a military news and culture website. A user posted the video to the website in 2016 and asked: \"Katt Williams a Marine?\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:40:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",

      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",

      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",

      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "Officials suspect wild migrating birds are likely to blame for the first known infection of a flock in Hawaii, which had been the last state in the country with no reported cases in poultry or wild birds during the current outbreak.",
      "Sequencing done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national lab in Iowa confirmed the infection, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "The specific genotype of the virus that infected the birds is known as A3, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokesperson for the federal Animal Plant Health Inspection Services.",
      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",
      "At least 10 birds, which included ducks, a goose and a zebra dove, had been reported dead at the property on Nov. 12. Samples from the dead birds were sent to be tested for the virus.",

      "Confirmation of the infected flock in Hawaii follows a detection of the virus in the area from wastewater samples collected by the state earlier this month.",
      "Health officials around the country have been closely watching for signs of H5N1 spreading in their communities amid mounting cases in humans across North America.",
      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",
      "Health officials in Canada announced this month\u00a0that they had detected a case of H5N1 bird flu in a critically ill hospitalized teenager. That patient had been infected by the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which is related to another ongoing poultry outbreak in British Columbia, the Canadian province where they lived.",
      "Experts say the virus that infected the teenager does appear to have some worrying mutations, which might explain why the case was more severe.",
      "\"The preliminary sequence from the H5N1 human case in British Columbia has been posted and it is not good news,\" Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, posted on Nov. 16.",

      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",

      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",

    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 19:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",

    "story": [
      "Americans planning to do some holiday baking this year may have to scramble to track down a key ingredient.",
      "Some stores around the U.S. are running short of eggs, especially those operating in states that require eggs from cage-free hens, as cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) flare and the virus spreads from wild birds to commercial flocks. More than 40% of the nation's roughly 300 million egg-laying hens are raised in cage-free facilities, but roughly 60% of \"bird flu\" cases recently detected involved cage-free farms.",
      "\"After two months of no outbreaks, we had them recently in Utah, Oregon, California and Washington, and three of those states are exclusively cage-free,\" Emily Metz, chief executive and president of the American Egg Board, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Where we are hearing reports of shortages it's at stores like a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.\"",
      "After a brief respite from bird flu among commercial-egg producers, HPAI struck again starting in mid-October, resulting in the loss of 2.8 million birds. The nation's egg production fell 2.6% last month from a year ago and is projected to be down 1% this year versus 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service recently said in a monthly\u00a0report.",
      "The outbreaks, which began in January of 2022, have affected nearly 110 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, including wild, commercial and backyard flocks in 49 states, according\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the first time HPAI, also known as H5N1,\u00a0had been detected in the U.S. since 2016.",
      "The return of bird flu is wiping out poultry populations at commercial facilities in multiple states, most recently striking more than a million egg-laying hens in California's Kern County, where HPAI had been confirmed in 2.2 million egg-laying hens the prior week, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "More than 790,000 egg layers were also culled last week at a commercial operation in Arizona's Pinal County.",
      "How long do shortages last?",
      "The tighter egg supplies means the U.S. is experiencing \"hyper-localized shortages that are very temporary and intermittent and that are corrected sometimes within a day,\" said Metz, whose board markets and promotes eggs and egg products.",
      "\"There are local areas where supplies aren't quite as strong, so you might see pockets where shelves get picked over,\" said Brent Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "After HPAI-related shortages drove up egg prices in the spring, the virus is having the same impact this winter. Experts forecast that egg prices could stay elevated for the rest of the year and into 2025.",
      "As with the cost of other commodities, egg prices fluctuate with supply and demand, the latter of which has remained fairly stable over the year, regardless of cost, according to the Farm Bureau's Nelson. The egg board, however, said America's appetite for the protein has grown of late, rising steadily for 20 consecutive quarters.",
      "\"We see egg prices ride the wave as bird flu comes and goes,\" Nelson said. Right now, \"Bird flu infections are by far the biggest factor impacting egg prices.\"",
      "The national average for a dozen eggs is $3.37, up 30% from a year ago but lower than the January 2023 average of $4.82, the economist said. But some regions are seeing even higher prices. In California, white cage-free eggs were selling for about $5.26 a dozen last week \u2014 up nearly 90% from $2.81 during the same time in 2023, according to the USDA.",
      "Despite the price spikes, Nelson and Metz advised consumers against hoarding a perishable product like eggs, emphasizing that shortages typically pass quickly as retailers replenish their supplies.",
      "\"Eggs keep in the fridge really well \u2014 if you need them, go and get them,\" said Nelson.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

    "story": [
      "It's well-documented that women in the workplace often face biases when seeking leadership roles, but new research is uncovering just how pervasive and wide-ranging those prejudices can be.",
      "In the working world, women leaders report experiencing 30 types of identity factors that discriminate on everything from their body size to marital status, according to new\u00a0research from Wilson College chief information officer Amy Diehl, Westmont College dean Leanne Dzubinski and Clarkson University professor Amber Stephenson published in the peer-reviewed Human Resource Development Quarterly.",
      "The findings stem from the trio's 2023 research into age discrimination. That work, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that women in the workplace\u00a0face bias\u00a0regardless of their age, with their superiors often viewing them as too inexperienced if they are young and too unworthy of promotion if they are older. The new study surveyed more than 900 women in leadership roles in four industries where women comprise a large share of the workforce \u2014 health care, higher education, law and faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"Surprised and shocked\"",
      "\"The way we phrased the question was, 'Tell us about any other identity factors that are impacting your experience'\" in the workforce, Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We thought there would be age and race. We were surprised and shocked when we looked through the data and came up with 30.\"",
      "It's telling that the factors focus on personal qualities like class, marital status and sexual orientation, rather than professional qualifications or skills, underscoring that these biases aren't relevant to whether a woman can perform in the workplace, the researchers said.",
      "\"There is always an excuse masquerading as a reason given for a women about why she's not quite right for any role,\" noted Dzubinski.",

      "Stumbling on the broken rung",
      "While the new research focuses on women in their 40s and 50s who have already reached leadership roles, younger women are more likely to be held back by the so-called broken rung, or when women fail to get a promotion out of entry-level jobs at the same rate as men, research from consulting firm McKinsey and LeanIn, the nonprofit started by former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, has found.",
      "Their research found bias may play a role in stunting women's careers, with young men often promoted on their potential while young women are judged more on their track records.",
      "The new research on bias encountered by women in leadership roles didn't examine how women coped with bias as they climbed the professional ladder, although Diehl noted that women who rise into senior positions tend to \"have a thick skin,\" and might use techniques such as diverting conversations away from identity issues when they arise.",
      "Bias from other women",
      "The researchers focused on four industries where workers are either split equally between men and women or are female-dominated, although the top leadership positions in all these fields are typically held by men. The goal, in short, was also to examine the impact of gender bias in industries not dominated by men.",
      "The women leaders who responded to the survey were college presidents, vice presidents and provosts within higher education; physicians and physician administrators in health care; lawyers and partners within the legal field; and women who hold top leadership roles in faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"If you have women well represented in the industry, we're still seeing that women are still experiencing various types of bias,\" Stephenson said. \"It's a very real and very embedded situation within any workplace\" regardless of gender composition.",
      "Dzubinski added, \"It used to be the argument that as soon as you get more women in, it would fix itself \u2014 it's not fixing itself.\"",
      "Women can internalize bias and express it against other women in their workplace, while some might believe that there's not enough room at the top for more than a few women, the researchers noted. That can lead to the belief the only way to ascend into leadership roles is if another woman loses her spot, they said.",
      "Can you combat workplace bias?",
      "It's difficult for women to fight such biases, given that others may judge women negatively regardless of their situation, such as whether they are married or unmarried, both of which can trigger prejudices, the research noted.",
      "\"Notice that they are contradictions \u2014 if you are married, that's a problem, or if you aren't married that's a problem,\" Dzubinski told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you put them together you see that they are made up excuses\" to justify why women don't deserve promotions.",
      "While difficult, women should try not to take identity-based criticism personally, Diehl said.",
      "\"It feels very much, 'It's about me,' but it really isn't. It's about larger, systematic gender bias that's trying to force them out of the workplace or into supporting roles, and not leadership roles,\" she said.",
      "Organizations can deal with some of these issues by going over their practices and checking whether these identity factors are playing a role in whether people receive or are denied promotions, the researchers said. Another tool is to use a \"flip it\" strategy, applying the same statement about a woman to a man, such as \"John can't take on this role because he just had a child',\" they noted.",
      "With an onling push against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) from conservative lawmakers, some companies are dropping their investment in DEI. That could pick up speed under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he'll do more to remove these policies in his next term, while Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's handbook for the next conservative White House, proposes removing all federal rules and programs around DEI.",
      "But rooting out bias can help organizations perform better, the researchers noted.",
      "\"When woman after woman is dealing with all this stuff day after day, it takes time away from them doing their actual job,\" Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hurting the organization in terms of the amount of quality work they can get to.\"",

      "While Cambridge Analytica said in the wake of the scandal that it deleted the data from Facebook, it was reported in 2018 that the firm had lied. Instead, it kept the information and used it to help then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Facebook's stock price was not impacted after Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data was revealed in 2015. But it plummeted in early 2018 after the consulting firm's ongoing misuse of Facebook data for the Trump campaign came to light.",
      "A group of investors who bought Facebook stock between February 2017 and July 2018 swiftly sued the tech giant in federal court, alleging the company's statements in the risk factors section of its 2016 10-K filing were misleading.",
      "In its filing, Facebook warned that \"security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\" The investors alleged the statements were inaccurate because they framed the risk of data misuse by third parties as hypothetical \u2014 even though Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data from Facebook members.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the claims, finding in part that the challenged statements weren't false because \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was [not] harming Facebook's reputation, business or competitive position\" when the company filed its 2016 risk disclosure.",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled for the shareholders and allowed their case to proceed, finding they adequately alleged Facebook's risk disclosures were misleading because the company \"represented the risk of improper access to or disclosure of Facebook user data as purely hypothetical when that risk had already transpired.\"",
      "Facebook then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the 9th Circuit's decision imposes \"expansive risk-disclosure requirements that will force public companies to inform investors of past incidents that pose no known threat to the business.\"",
      "The company also noted that there is a split among the federal courts of appeals as to what companies have to disclose on their SEC filings. One, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, doesn't require firms to disclose any past events in their risk factors, while other appeals courts require such disclosures only if the company knows the prior events will harm their business.",
      "Facebook said that the 9th Circuit's rule would open the door to lawsuits alleging \"fraud-by-hindsight\" and make risk disclosures burdensome to companies and less useful to investors as they seek to avoid liability.",
      "The Biden administration backed the shareholders in the case, arguing that \"it is plainly misleading to characterize an adverse event that has already materialized as a merely hypothetical future risk.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:09:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could raise costs for U.S. consumers, economists say. Here's how much grocery bills could rise.",
    "story": [
      "Americans say they continue to feel the aftereffects of the highest inflation in four decades, especially at the grocery store, where prices remain 26% higher than before the pandemic. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could cause even more financial strain in the nation's food aisles by reigniting price hikes, according to a recent study.",
      "Although it remains to be seen what he does as president, ahead of the Nov. 5 election Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, as well as a 60% tariff on products from China. Manufacturers and retailers typically pass on at least some of those costs to customers.",
      "As a result, hefty new tariffs could cause prices for a range of consumer goods, from everyday items such as groceries to less frequent purchases like furniture, to rise, according to the\u00a0analysis\u00a0from Third Way, a left-leaning think tank. Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",

    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",

    "summary": "The FDA says America's food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" despite some recent high-profile recalls and outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",

      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video).

      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

    "summary": "Americans struggling to stay financially afloat should consider debt relief before tapping into retirement accounts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "No one wants to file for bankruptcy, but if you're heading in that direction, delaying the inevitable may only make things worse.",
      "Bankruptcies are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but have gone up relative to last year. Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",

    "story": [
      "H&R Block and Intuit shares dropped on Tuesday after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking at developing a free app for people to file their taxes.",
      "The publication cited two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in reporting that the leaders of the incoming administration's DOGE discussed the idea of crafting a mobile app to file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "H&R Block shares tumbled 8.2%, while Intuit shed 5.1% on Tuesday. As the dominant players in tax preparation, H&R Block and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, generate billions in revenue annually by offering online and in-person services.",
      "The Biden Administration in March rolled out a pilot Direct File program through the IRS in 12 states. It allows qualified taxpayers file directly through a federal portal. Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The DOGE, which has been directed by Trump to slash government spending and cut federal regulations, criticized the complexity of the U.S tax code in a Nov. 16 post on X, the social media service owned by Musk.",
      "\"In 1955, there were less than 1.5 million words in the U.S. Tax Code.   Today, there are more than 16 million words,\" its X account wrote. \"Because of this complexity, Americans collectively spend 6.5 billion hours preparing and filing their taxes each year.\"",
      "Intuit and H&R Block also have free filing options.",
      "That said, the Federal Trade Commission earlier in the year barred Intuit from advertising its popular TurboTax product as free when most people have to pay to use it. The FTC in February filed an administrative complaint against H&R Block, alleging it marketed its tax-prep products as free yet deleted the data as a way to pressure them to pay for pricier services.

      "President-elect Donald Trump nominated Dr. Marty Makary Friday to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who opposed vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Makary, a Johns Hopkins University professor, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system to be \"broken\" and in need of a shakeup.",
      "Makary has criticized in books and articles the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "\"I'm a part of a generation that says, 'We as a medical generation have made some mistakes, we've done things that resulted in a loss of the public trust and we need to be open and honest about our problems if we're going to fix it,'\" Markey\u00a0said\u00a0in a 2012 interview with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Trump announced the nomination in a statement Friday night, saying Makary would \"restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\" Makary will have to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though he was not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, Makary had concerns about vaccinations in young children.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, Makary was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "In a February 2021 Wall Street Journal piece, he wrote that \"COVID will be mostly gone by April, allowing Americans to resume normal life.\" That summer the delta variant of the virus ripped through the U.S., followed by omicron in the winter, leading to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.",
      "If Makary is confirmed and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also confirmed as Trump's pick to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, Makary would likely report to Kennedy. Makary does not share Kennedy's discredited views on vaccines, but he has a similar distrust of the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Makary has lamented that drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Makary would also inherit a number of ongoing projects at the FDA kicked off by outgoing Commissioner Robert Califf, including the reorganization of the agency's food division and plans to regulate artificial intelligence in medical technology.",
      "In the event of other controversial initiatives under Trump, career staffers may simply drag the work out until a new administration comes to power.",

    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",
      "\"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.",

    "summary": "Trump's new lawyers will have to decide how to handle hot-button issues before the high court this term, including cases on treatments for transgender youth and on ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court convenes for arguments in December, the justices will hear from the top lawyer for the Biden administration, who will urge them to strike down laws in nearly half the states that ban hormone treatments for transgender minors.",
      "In January, President-elect Donald Trump's new lawyers at the Justice Department will have to decide if the federal government still believes those laws are unconstitutional.",
      "How to handle ongoing cases before the Supreme Court is always one of the most consequential questions for a new presidential administration. It's a big task. Of the 45 cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear for its current term, which began in October, the United States is party to 21 of them, including the case over certain treatments for transgender youth. In many others, the Biden administration has outlined its view of the legal issues.",
      "In most of those cases, the Justice Department takes a predictable, even nonpartisan approach, such as by routinely defending federal criminal prosecutions on appeal.",
      "But other cases involve judgment calls that reflect the new administration's policy preferences.",
      "In addition to the transgender case, many others touch on hot-button issues: the Biden administration supported a federal regulation of ghost guns, which are weapons that people can buy in pieces and put together at home; it opposed a lower court's ban on a Texas law that requires people who access pornographic websites to prove they are adults; and it defended the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize flavored e-cigarette products for sale.",
      "But Trump's lawyers can flip these positions. As Chief Justice John Roberts noted in 2022, \"a new administration is of course as a general matter entitled to do that.\"",
      "How does it work? That depends.",
      "If the United States lost the case in the lower court, the new lawyers can simply dismiss the appeal.",
      "The Biden administration took this approach in a prominent 2020 abortion case over Trump's decision to bar federally funded health clinics from making abortion referrals. When a lower court struck down the policy, Trump's lawyers brought it to the Supreme Court, which agreed to consider the issue.. But after President Biden took office in early 2021, his legal team dropped the appeal and the case was removed from the Supreme Court's calendar.",
      "The Trump administration will now have to decide whether to withdraw its appeal in the transgender case. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, a Biden appointee who argues on behalf of the government before the Supreme Court, has argued that state laws that keep minors from taking hormones \"discriminate[] based on transgender status.\" Trump, who campaigned on getting \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools,\" is unlikely to see the issue the same way.",
      "But Trump's lawyers may consider staying the course if it looks like the Supreme Court disagrees with the Biden administration's position at oral argument early next month. This prospect seems likely because the ACLU is poised to pursue the case if the government drops out, making withdrawal by the new Trump administration potentially futile.",
      "The Trump administration's approach to the ghost-guns case is also unclear. At oral argument in October, the justices indicated that they had no issue with the Biden administration's regulations on these do-it-yourself weapons, buoying the spirits of gun-control advocates. If the Trump administration opposes the regulations on ghost guns, which subject these weapons to the same requirements as firearms sold commercially, it could dismiss the case, which would keep intact a lower court ruling that blocked the rule.",
      "In contrast, if another party is appealing a case that the U.S. won in the lower court, the approach of Trump's lawyers may depend on different factors.",
      "One factor is how far the case has progressed. In January 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a criminal-sentencing case. But before the parties submitted briefs outlining their arguments in the case, the Biden administration told the Supreme Court that \"following the change in administration, the Department of Justice began a process of reviewing the government's interpretation of\" the law and reversed course. The Supreme Court then appointed an outside lawyer to argue the Trump administration's previous position.",
      "And regardless, the Supreme Court's caseload may change if Trump rolls back Mr. Biden's policies. In 2017, Trump, in his first term, dropped former President Barack Obama's policy for bathroom use for transgender students right before a Republican challenge to the guidance landed at the Supreme Court, which brought an end to the case.",

    "story": [
      "Russia launched a volley of missiles toward the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro early Thursday morning, including a new type of ballistic missile that has North Atlantic Treaty Organization members on edge.",
      "The powerful next-level, multiple-warhead battlefield weapon, which has been analyzed by the Pentagon, has prompted NATO to hold an emergency summit on Tuesday. Among the cruise missiles intercepted in the assault was what the Defense Department has identified as a variant of the RS-26, an \"experimental\" intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a reconfigured Russian intercontinental ballistic missile, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The missile aimed at Dnipro in central Ukraine focused on one area, carrying six warheads about 750 miles from the launch location, in retaliation for Ukraine's attack earlier in the week on a military facility in Russia. Ukraine is bracing for more volleys.",
      "While publicly, U.S. officials say Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles, sources say these ballistic missiles pose a unique threat. They're capable of reaching 3,000 miles, and carrying a multiple-payload system. These systems are designed to carry and launch multiple warheads and to release them at different speeds and different directions, potentially over an area of more than 1,000 miles. They're also capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Heightening U.S. and NATO concerns further, it's the first time such a system has been used, and much still remains unknown about their utilization.",
      "\"What if he decides to target Lviv next,\" a U.S. official said, referencing a city in Western Ukraine near the border with Poland.",
      "The systems' capabilities challenge even the most advanced of Ukraine's air defense systems, as the war-weary nation tries to defend itself from Russia more than 2.5 years after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Russian officials warned the U.S. of the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels. That helped ensure that it wasn't misidentified as an intercontinental ballistic missile and therefore a possible nuclear threat.",
      "While Russia already has sufficient weapons in its arsenal to strike NATO partners, Poland is particularly unnerved by these new developments.

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

    "story": [
      "Just a week before Thanksgiving, shoppers at Stop & Shop stores across Massachusetts were forced to leave empty-handed after a cyberattack against the supermarket chain's parent company led to inventory shortages.",
      "Parent company Ahold Delhaize said in a statement earlier this month, that it had alerted law enforcement about the cyber breach and had taken some systems offline. \"While there may be some limited inventory for certain products, we are working to re-stock our shelves and anticipate item availability to continue to improve over the next few days,\" the company said. But the incident may be a sign of things to come during the holiday season, when cybersecurity crises are likely to peak.",
      "Already this year, corporate giants like AT&T, Ticketmaster and United Health have suffered paralyzing cyberattacks, and now, businesses are bracing for the holidays, a time when many cybersecurity operations rely on skeleton staffing. But the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning that it's no time for them to be taking a \"cyber vacation.\"",
      "The vast majority of ransomware attacks that hobbled businesses and organizations over the past year \u2014 86% \u2014\u00a0 occurred on a weekend or holiday, according to a new global study of 900 IT and security professionals released this week by cybersecurity firm Semperis. But researchers also found that 85% of surveyed organizations \u2014 90% in the U.S. \u2014 reduce security staffing by as much as 50% during those same periods.",
      "\"This study would say that we're not making thoughtful choices,\" former White House \"cyber czar\" and Semperis strategic adviser Chris Inglis told CBS News. \"If you realize that most of these attacks take place on holidays and weekends and you reduce your manning, you take away your opportunity to essentially have parity with your adversaries,\" said Inglis. He added, \"The advantage goes to the attacker, because they're not taking a day off. They never take a day off.\"",
      "According to the report, organizations consistently overestimate their defenses, with 81% of respondents reporting that they believe they have the necessary expertise to safeguard their digital identities from threats. Still, 83% of participants suffered a successful ransomware attack within the past year.",
      "Organizations are beginning to sense they're more vulnerable around the holidays, but Inglis suggested consumers, too, need to be vigilant. Technologies like smart phones and tablets are now cheaper and nearly ubiquitous, but safety measures have not kept up.",
      "\"We've not actually made the necessary investments to make it such that these technologies \u2014 or this system of technologies \u2014 is defensible and well defended,\" he said.",
      "According to the survey, mergers, acquisitions, stock launches or layoffs also functioned as \"magnets\" for ransomware attacks, with a majority of respondents \u2013 63% \u2013 also experiencing a cyber attack following what's known as a \"material corporate event.\"",
      "With financial executives predicting that President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House could usher in a wave of bank mergers and acquisitions, cybersecurity experts worry that cybercriminals will be able to take advantage of these \"moments of distraction.\"",
      "\"Our adversaries \u2013 be they criminal or foreign, rogue nations \u2013 they test the waters every day. They're conscious of the fact that our attention waxes and wanes,\" Inglis said. \"If there's a merger or an administration transition, those are moments of distraction. So we can expect that they will do what they always do. It's not that they search at this moment, it's that they see their opportunities being perhaps more productive at this moment.\"",
      "In February, UnitedHealth Group suffered the biggest hack in U.S. healthcare history after its acquisition of Change Healthcare meant it inherited outdated technology, with digital systems not yet safeguarded by multi-factor authentication.",
      "Beyond an anticipated onslaught of big bank deals, changes in administration \u2013 regardless of politics \u2013 have historically enticed foreign adversaries to test the defenses of new leadership in Washington. In 2021, President Joe Biden inherited fallout from a sophisticated Russian cyberattack leveled against Texas software-maker SolarWinds and used to breach roughly 100 top U.S. companies and a dozen government agencies.",
      "In June 2017, the Russian military waged the devastating 'NotPetya' cyber attack during Trump's first year in office, unleashing a virus that crippled parts of Ukraine's infrastructure and ravaged computer systems worldwide, amounting to billions in damages.",
      "Security staffing also remains a widespread challenge across industries, with just 85% of organizations maintaining a year-round, 24-hour Security Operations Center, according to Semperis, and staffing challenges prompted by higher overtime costs when most employees are typically out of the office around the holidays.",
      "Contributing to cybersecurity staffing headaches, cybersecurity workforce growth worldwide has flatlined for the first time since 2019. With growth of just 0.1% year-over-year in 2024, budget cuts, layoffs and hiring freezes have exacerbated a global staffing shortage of cybersecurity professionals, according to a recent report released by ISC2.",
      "The former U.S. national cyber director said that he's routinely asked what keeps him up at night. \"It's not the attackers, the Russians, the Chinese or any kind of ransomware actors. It's us,\" Inglis said. \"Sometimes, it's the complacency and the proactive ambivalence on our side that is actually, I think, more determinative of our future.\"",

      "Gaetz concluded on his own that he lacked enough support from Republican senators, according to two people familiar with the situation. Ultimately, given the controversy surrounding Gaetz, at least 15 GOP senators might have opposed the pick, according to one of the sources. One GOP senator told CBS News that there were at least eight hard \"no\" votes on Gaetz, a total that never budged.",
      "Trump had\u00a0tapped Gaetz to lead the Justice Department as the nation's top law enforcement officer last week.

A police report provided details of the incident, which Hegseth said at the time was consensual. He has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came just two days before the Ethics Committee was set to meet to discuss whether to release a report detailing its years-long investigation into the Florida Republican.

The committee planned to reconvene on Dec. 5 \"to further consider this matter,\" Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters after the initial meeting.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it was looking into allegations against Gaetz of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts and giving \"special privileges and favors,\" and obstructing the investigations into his conduct.

      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 10:27:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court issued its first opinion of the term, a one-line decision dismissing Facebook's appeal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court order reviving a shareholder lawsuit brought against the social media giant in light of consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's 2015 misuse of millions of Facebook users' data.",
      "In its first opinion of the term, the high court issued a one-line unsigned decision dismissing Facebook's appeal. The court's ruling indicates it believes it should not have taken up the case, though the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning.",
      "In tossing the appeal, the Supreme Court leaves in place a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in favor of Facebook shareholders. They had filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Facebook for allegedly misleading them in financial filings about the risks stemming from the massive data breach by Cambridge Analytica.",
      "The case involved what information publicly traded companies must disclose in the \"risk factors\" section of their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically, whether they're obligated to share risks that materialized in the past, even if those events don't present ongoing or future business harm.",
      "The dispute stems from a class action lawsuit that arose out of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica had purchased data collected through a personality quiz on Facebook and used it to create psychological profiles of U.S. voters to assist GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "While Cambridge Analytica said in the wake of the scandal that it deleted the data from Facebook, it was reported in 2018 that the firm had lied. Instead, it kept the information and used it to help then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Facebook's stock price was not impacted after Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data was revealed in 2015. But it plummeted in early 2018 after the consulting firm's ongoing misuse of Facebook data for the Trump campaign came to light.",
      "A group of investors who bought Facebook stock between February 2017 and July 2018 swiftly sued the tech giant in federal court, alleging the company's statements in the risk factors section of its 2016 10-K filing were misleading.",
      "In its filing, Facebook warned that \"security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\" The investors alleged the statements were inaccurate because they framed the risk of data misuse by third parties as hypothetical \u2014 even though Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data from Facebook members.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the claims, finding in part that the challenged statements weren't false because \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was [not] harming Facebook's reputation, business or competitive position\" when the company filed its 2016 risk disclosure.",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled for the shareholders and allowed their case to proceed, finding they adequately alleged Facebook's risk disclosures were misleading because the company \"represented the risk of improper access to or disclosure of Facebook user data as purely hypothetical when that risk had already transpired.\"",
      "Facebook then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the 9th Circuit's decision imposes \"expansive risk-disclosure requirements that will force public companies to inform investors of past incidents that pose no known threat to the business.\"",
      "The company also noted that there is a split among the federal courts of appeals as to what companies have to disclose on their SEC filings. One, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, doesn't require firms to disclose any past events in their risk factors, while other appeals courts require such disclosures only if the company knows the prior events will harm their business.",
      "Facebook said that the 9th Circuit's rule would open the door to lawsuits alleging \"fraud-by-hindsight\" and make risk disclosures burdensome to companies and less useful to investors as they seek to avoid liability.",
      "The Biden administration backed the shareholders in the case, arguing that \"it is plainly misleading to characterize an adverse event that has already materialized as a merely hypothetical future risk.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. JD Vance's election as vice president has opened up one of Ohio's U.S. Senate seats.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. JD Vance's election as vice president has opened up one of Ohio's U.S. Senate seats for the third time in as many years, setting off a scramble for the appointment among the state's ruling Republicans.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is tasked with filling the vacancy, giving the pragmatic center-right politician a hand in setting his party's course in the state potentially for years to come. His decision will be made in the afterglow of sweeping wins by Republicans in November under the leadership of President-elect Donald Trump, but a poor choice could also help Democrats reclaim a place in Ohio's Senate delegation when the seat comes up for reelection in less than two years.",
      "\"Look, being a United States senator is a big deal,\" DeWine told reporters in the days after the election. \"It's a big deal for the state, and we need to get it right.\"",
      "DeWine has a long list to choose from \u2014 particularly given the number of GOP candidates who competed unsuccessfully in Senate primaries in 2022 and 2024. Those under consideration who previously lost crowded Republican primaries are former Ohio Republican Chair Jane Timken; two-term Secretary of State Frank LaRose; and state Sen. Matt Dolan, whose family owns baseball's Cleveland Guardians. Two-term Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican attorney and strategist Mehek Cooke, a frequent guest on Fox News, are also in the mix.",
      "One other prospective appointee \u2014 a 2024 presidential contender, Cincinnati pharmaceutical entrepreneur and Vance insider Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 pulled out of contention after accepting a position in the new Trump administration.",
      "While Vance's departure also offers DeWine an opportunity to alleviate a bottleneck at the top of Ohio Republicans' political pecking order, where Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Attorney General Dave Yost are preparing to face off for governor in 2026, that appears unlikely. Husted is well into building his campaign organization, and Yost has said he would decline the appointment if offered. DeWine \u2014 a 77-year-old former U.S. senator term-limited in 2026 \u2014 also has said he would not appoint himself.",
      "Meanwhile, ambitions for the seat among Republican members of Ohio's congressional delegation \u2014 which includes U.S. Reps. Jim Jordan, Mike Carey, David Joyce and Warren Davidson \u2014 are being tempered by the slim House majority their party scored in November. House vacancies necessarily take months to fill under Ohio's election protocols, likely a consideration for DeWine as Trump prepares to push early policy priorities through Congress.",
      "Under state law, whoever gets the appointment will serve from the date of Vance's resignation, which he hasn't yet announced, until Dec. 15, 2026. A special election for the last two years of his six-year term would be held in November 2026.",
      "That special election could provide a comeback opportunity for Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who was unseated earlier this month by Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno. Though he wasn't specific, Brown told Politico last week: \"I'm going to stay in this arena. I'm not going away.\" Former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic Senate nominee who lost to Vance in 2022, could make another run, too. And Allison Russo, the Democratic leader of the Ohio House, also has been mentioned as a 2026 Senate contender.",
      "DeWine has made clear that he wants the Republican he chooses to be well positioned to defeat the Democrats in 2026. Their strengths as a statewide candidate and fundraiser are particularly important because Ohio's statewide elections also take place that year \u2014 and every seat is open. A strong incumbent senator at the top of that ticket could be valuable to returning Republicans to the offices of governor, attorney general, treasurer, auditor and secretary of state.",
      "Stamina also could be a factor. Timken ran for Senate most recently in 2022, LaRose ran this year, and Dolan ran both times. A win in 2026 would only give the victor a two-year reprieve before having to face Ohio voters again in 2028.",
      "\"This is not for the faint-hearted,\" DeWine said.",
      "Dolan, who along with Timken is a millionaire, is rare among Republicans competing for the Vance appointment in not having ever won Trump's backing.",
      "In both 2022 and 2024, Dolan ran in Republicans' moderate lane, declining to align with Trump and disavowing his false claims that voter fraud lost him the 2020 election. Those stances won him DeWine's endorsement in last year's Senate primary, which could be a good sign for the term-limited Ohio Senate Finance chairman.",
      "The president-elect backed Vance in 2022 and Moreno this year \u2014 lifting both to victory. Moreno won a three-way Republican primary against Dolan and LaRose, while Vance topped a field of seven, before both went on to defeat Democratic opponents in now reliably red Ohio.",
      "In the state Legislature, Dolan opposed Ohio's now-blocked ban on abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected and an unsuccessful effort to override then-Gov. John Kasich's veto. Both LaRose and Sprague, then a state senator and representative, respectively, supported both the bill and the override effort.",
      "Timken, a Trump loyalist, has never held public office, but as a Senate candidate she described herself as \"a powerful ally for the pro-life movement\" and supported overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "Former U.S. Sen. Rob Portman backed Timken in the 2022 Senate primary, calling the Harvard-educated attorney and wife of former TimkenSteel CEO Tim Timken a smart, hard-working conservative.",
      "Some believe DeWine's penchant for elevating women could give her or Cooke an edge in the competition. Both his chief of staff and communications director are women and more than half of his Cabinet is female.",
      "Though Trump endorsed Vance over Timken for Senate in 2022, he had earlier hand-selected her to lead the Ohio Republican Party after his first election in 2016, and he has since supported her election as RNC National Committeewoman for Ohio.",
      "While Trump also passed over LaRose for a Senate endorsement this year, he had backed both him and Sprague in bids for statewide office \u2014 and both have endorsed him back.",
      "Both have twice won statewide races, though LaRose's high profile as Ohio's elections chief keeps him in the headlines more than Sprague, and he would be the first Green Beret to serve in the Senate. At the same time, the absence of controversy that has marked Sprague's tenure at the state treasury could make him less likely than LaRose to draw a primary challenger.",
      "DeWine says he wants his appointee to be focused on both state and national issues and willing to work hard and \"get things done.\" He also hinted that the person's politics can't be too extreme.",
      "\"It also has to be someone who can win a primary, it has to be someone who can win a general election, and then two years later do all that again,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The land offer highlights the divide between states and local governments on supporting or resisting Trump's mass deportation plans.",
    "story": [
      "RIO GRANDE VALLEY \u2013 Texas is offering a parcel of rural ranchland along the U.S.-Mexico border to use as a staging area for potential mass deportations under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The property, which Texas originally purchased last October, is located in rural Starr County in the Rio Grande Valley. Republican Dawn Buckingham, the Texas Land Commissioner, sent a letter Nov. 14 to Trump extending the offer.",
      "\"We do hear through back channels that they are taking a look at it and considering it. But we just want them to know we're a good partner. We're here. We want to be helpful,\" Buckingham told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday.",
      "The property has no paved roads and sits in a county with one public hospital and limited local resources. But Buckingham stressed its location.",
      "\"We feel like this is actually very well-located. The land is very flat there. It's adjacent to major airports. It's also adjacent to a bridge over the river,\" Buckingham said. \"So if it's helpful, then I would love to partner up with the federal government. And if it's not, then we'll continue to look to ways to be helpful to them.\"",
      "The land offer is the latest illustration of a sharp divide between states and local governments on whether to support or resist Trump's plans for mass deportations of migrants living in the U.S. illegally. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council voted to become a \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction, limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities to carry out deportations.",
      "Texas leaders have long backed aggressive measures on the border to curb crossings, including installing razor-wire barriers and passing a law last year that would allow law enforcement to arrest migrants who cross the border illegally.",
      "\"By offering this newly-acquired 1400-acre property to the incoming Trump Administration for the construction of a facility for the processing, detention, and coordination of what will be the largest deportation of violent criminals in our nation's history, I stand united with President Donald Trump to ensure American families are protected,\" Buckingham said in an earlier statement.",
      "Trump has said he plans to begin his deportation efforts on the first day of his presidency. He frequently attacked illegal immigration during his campaign, linking a record spike in unauthorized border crossings to issues ranging from drug trafficking to high housing prices.",
      "There are an estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the country. Questions remain about how people would be identified and where they would be detained.",
      "The president-elect's transition team did not say whether they would accept Texas' offer but sent a statement.",
      "\"On day one, President Trump will marshal every lever of power to secure the border, protect their communities, and launch the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrant criminals in history,\" Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman for Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance, said Wednesday.",
      "The Texas General Land Office did not disclose the amount paid for the land, but Buckingham stated the previous owner resisted the creation of a border wall.",
      "A 1.5-mile stretch of border wall was built under Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2021 on that land. Buckingham said with the recent purchase, the state has created another easement for more border wall construction.",

      "ProPublica reported in September\u00a0that internal reports showed the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review Committee determined the deaths of two women were preventable, but found that doctors were hesitant to perform a procedure that could have saved their lives because of the state's strict abortion policies.",

A judge initially struck down the ban, but Georgia's Supreme Court halted the ruling in October, restoring the law.",
      "\"To have any time where we don't have this committee in place is difficult to fathom, realizing that we may lose access to really important data and information that could help us make better decisions and organize better around what we need for the state,\" Simpson said.",
      "Toomey wrote that reconstituting the committee \"will not result in a delay\" of the committee's responsibilities.",
      "The Georgia Department of Public Health will open applications for new members in the \"coming weeks,\" Toomey said in the letter, but will work to make sure there is more oversight and confidentiality in its review of cases.",

      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp doesn't appoint or release members of the committee because it's overseen by the Department of Public Health, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said. Kemp signed into law in 2019 a ban on abortions once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.",

      "An Alabama prisoner convicted of the 1994 murder of a female hitchhiker on Thursday became the third person executed by nitrogen gas in both the U.S. and Alabama. The United States Supreme Court denied a final petition to halt the execution Thursday afternoon, paving the way for it to go ahead as planned.",
      "Carey Dale Grayson, 50, was one of four teenagers convicted of killing Vickie Deblieux, 37, who was hitchhiking through Alabama on her way to her mother's home in Louisiana. He was executed Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in south Alabama.",
      "\"My prayer for Vickie's family is that they can find solace in the State of Alabama finally serving justice for their heartbreaking loss,\" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement following Thursday's execution. \"And my hope is that one day it will not take three decades to provide justice for other victims of violent crimes.\"",
      "Alabama this year began using nitrogen gas to carry out some death sentences, the first use of a new execution method in the United States since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Alabama maintains the method is constitutional. But critics \u2014   citing how the first two people executed shook for several minutes \u2014   say the method needs more scrutiny, particularly if other states follow Alabama's path and adopt the new execution method.",
      "Deblieux's mutilated body was found at the bottom of a bluff near Odenville, Alabama, on Feb. 26, 1994. Prosecutors said Deblieux was hitchhiking from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to her mother's home in West Monroe, Louisiana, when four teens offered her a ride. Prosecutors said the teens took her to a wooded area and attacked and beat her. They threw her off a cliff and later returned to mutilate her body.",
      "A medical examiner testified that Deblieux's face was so fractured that she was identified by an earlier X-ray of her spine. Her fingers had also been severed. Investigators said the four teens were identified as suspects after one of them showed a friend a severed finger and boasted about the killing.",
      "Grayson was the only one of the four who faced a death sentence since the other teens were under 18 at the time of the killing. Grayson was 19. Two of the teens were initially sentenced to death but had those sentences set aside when the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of offenders who were younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. Another teen involved in Deblieux's killing was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Grayson's final appeals focused on the call for more scrutiny of the new execution method. They argued that the person experiences \"conscious suffocation\" and that the first two nitrogen executions did not result in swift unconsciousness and death as the state promised. Attorneys for Grayson asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to give time to weigh the constitutionality of the method.",
      "\"Given this is the first new execution method used in the United States since lethal injection was first used in 1982, it is appropriate for this Court to reach the issues surrounding this novel method,\" Grayson's attorneys wrote.",
      "Lawyers for the Alabama attorney general's office asked justices to let the execution go forward, saying a lower court found Grayson's claims speculative.",
      "The state lawyers wrote that Alabama's \"nitrogen hypoxia protocol has been successfully used twice, and both times it resulted in a death within a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Kenny Smith was\u00a0the first person to die by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0earlier this year, drawing international outcry.",
      "Alan Eugene Miller\u00a0was the second. He was executed by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0last month.",

Trump selected the 44-year-old Army veteran \u2014 who served in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 last week, citing his military experience and calling him a \"Warrior for the Troops.\"",

That means taking care of our service members, equipping them with the latest technology, and focusing on making our military the most lethal force on the planet,\" he said in a statement. \"Pete pledged that the Pentagon will focus on strength and hard power \u2014 not the current administration's woke political agenda.\"",
      "The allegations against Hegseth were revealed last week when officials in Monterey, California, released a public statement disclosing an incident that occurred the night of Oct. 7, 2017, and into the morning of Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel. An incident report was filed with the Monterey Police Department five days later.",
      "That police report, which was released Wednesday to CBS News and other outlets in response to public records requests, provided more details about the incident between Hegseth and the unidentified woman. The alleged victim told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her after a Republican women's event at the hotel. She said he took her phone, blocked the door to a hotel room and refused to let her leave, according to the investigative report.",
      "The report said law enforcement was first notified of the alleged assault by a nurse informing police that a patient requested a sexual assault exam. Police also spoke with a hotel staffer and another woman who was at the event with Hegseth.",
      "The alleged victim told the nurse that she had been drinking with coworkers but thinks something may have been slipped into her drink because she could not remember many of the night's events. She recalled being in a coworker's hotel room, laying on either a couch or bed, and a bare-chested Hegseth hovering over her with his dog tags hanging over her face. According to the report, she said that Hegseth ejaculated on her stomach and then asked, \"Are you OK?\"",
      "The unidentified woman said her last memory was of walking into her hotel room, though she told police she did not remember how she got back to it, the report states.",
      "Hegseth also spoke with police and claimed the alleged victim led him to his room. He said the interaction was consensual and he checked multiple times to make sure the woman was comfortable with what was happening, according to the report.",
      "Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's lawyer, said \"This police report confirms what I've said all along. That the incident was fully investigated and the police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed.\"",
      "While no charges were filed, neither Monterey police nor city officials have publicly said the allegations were found to be false.",
      "Parlatore had told CBS News on Monday that his client paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault because he was concerned Fox News would fire him because of the allegation.",
      "In addition to the allegations against Hegseth, his selection has drawn criticism due to his lack of high-level national security experience. The Defense Department is the largest federal agency, with more than 3 million civilian and military employees and a budget of more than $800 billion. He's also drawn criticism for his stance that women should not be in combat roles in the U.S. military.",
      "The meetings come a day after former Rep. Matt Gaetz also met with GOP senators before withdrawing his name from consideration for attorney general.

    "story": [
      "After former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration for attorney general, President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday evening that he was selecting Pam Bondi, Florida's former attorney general, as his replacement.",
      "\"I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States,\" Trump said in a statement, adding that she was \"smart and tough\" and \"will do a terrific job.\"",
      "Bondi was the first woman elected to serve as Florida's attorney general, spending eight years in the role after working as assistant state attorney for Hillsborough County. According to Trump's social media post, Bondi focused on curbing immigration and combating the opioid epidemic during her tenure.",
      "Bondi, a Trump loyalist, then turned her attention to national politics, working in the White House as both a legal adviser and defense attorney for Trump during the Senate's 2020 impeachment trial. She also spoke at a Pennsylvania press conference following the 2020 presidential election alongside\u00a0 Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani \u2014 falsely claiming Trump had won the state before President Biden was declared its winner. She was also a surrogate for Trump's most recent campaign.",
      "Gaetz reacted to the pick, posting to social media that Bondi was a \"stellar selection\" and a \"proven litigator, inspiring leader and a champion for all Americans.\"",
      "If confirmed, Bondi would be in charge of the Justice Department's 100,000 employees and oversee investigative components like the FBI and DEA. And she would assume the top job in a department that has investigated and prosecuted Trump for years.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith has filed two indictments against Trump, one over his alleged illegal retention of classified records, and another over allegations that he resisted the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts and a federal judge earlier this year dismissed the classified documents case against him.",
      "Smith is now actively working to end the election-related case\u00a0against the president-elect because of department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Smith is likely to leave his post at the Justice Department before Trump's inauguration, according to two sources familiar with the plans.",
      "In June 2023, after he was indicted on federal charges related to classified documents, Trump vowed to, \"appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of America, Joe Biden, and go after the Biden crime family.\" Since then, he and his allies have railed against the Justice Department, alleging political interference and abuse of power.",
      "\"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\" Trump said in his statement Thursday.",
      "Gaetz announced on Thursday that he would withdraw his nomination for attorney general, just over a week after Trump tapped him for the post. The selection was widely considered to be the most controversial the president-elect had made, with Gaetz having been the subject of multiple investigations into alleged conduct related to sex trafficking, obstruction, sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Gaetz promptly resigned from Congress following Trump's announcement, which came days before the House Ethics Committee was set to meet to consider releasing a report into its investigation into the Florida Republican's conduct. When the panel met days later, after its jurisdiction over Gaetz had ended with his decision to leave Congress, members said they did not reach agreement on whether to release the report. The next day, after meeting with Senate Republicans, Gaetz announced he would withdraw.",
      "Even Senate Republicans were skeptical of Gaetz' chances of being confirmed next year, despite being slated to hold a narrow majority in the chamber.",
      "Bondi will be the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general since Loretta Lynch ascended to the top job during the Obama administration. Bondi's top deputy would be Todd Blanche, who has spent the last several months serving as Trump's defense attorney, and previously worked as a corporate defense attorney and federal prosecutor.",
      "Other Trump defense attorneys are also set to be nominated to Justice Department leadership positions, including Emil Bove, who will be Trump's principal deputy attorney general, and D. John Sauer, who Trump said he will nominate as solicitor general.",
      "Much of Bondi's initiatives will also depend on who Trump appoints to lead other Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also be key to the agenda as it will issue decisions on presidential power, including potentially about which federal employees the president can fire.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term, but Vice President-elect JD Vance has said he and Trump were interviewing potential replacements earlier this week. Wray has given no indication he plans on leaving the post.",

      "Weeks after McBride became the first transgender person\u00a0elected to Congress, a Republican-led effort to restrict restroom use in the Capitol got underway this week. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican,\u00a0introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to limit use of single-sex bathrooms in the Capitol complex to those corresponding to users' \"biological sex.\"",
      "McBride, who also made history as the first trans person ever elected to a state senate seat, has tended to stay above the fray, stressing that her priority is to work for Delawareans in the House. She told CBS News that she wants people to see her \"competence in governing contrast with their chaos.\"",
      "\"I would like my grace to contrast with the grandstanding that we're seeing right now.\" McBride said. \"I would like my approach of respecting everyone to contrast with the disrespect that we are seeing right now.\"",
      "Mace's two-page resolution alleges that \"allowing biological males\" into the facilities \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity of Members, officers, and employees of the House who are female\" and would task the sergeant-at-arms with enforcing the measure.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that he supports restricting the \"single-sex facilities\" in the Capitol, saying in a statement that the facilities \"are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\"",

      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years.

He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for.

Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",

      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",

    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Workers at the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with identifying improvements for federal agencies to protect public interests, have the highest median salary, at about $242,000, according to federal data. That's followed by employees at the American Battle Monuments Commission, with a median salary of about $228,000.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state's most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\" Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird's release, shared by the government on Friday.",
      "\"I'll miss Gus. It's been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn't have missed,\" she added.",
      "Biddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.",
      "\"He absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They're social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\" she said.",
      "Gus gained weight in her care, from 47 pounds when he was found to 54 pounds. He is 39 inches tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is farther south than Western Australia.",
      "The government said that with the Southern Hemisphere summer approaching, it had been time-crucial to return Gus to the ocean where he could thermoregulate.",
      "Emperor penguins have been known to cover up to 1,000 miles on foraging journeys that last up to a month, the government said.",
      "They are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea\u00a0ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",
      "The penguins breed and live on sea ice, but the\u00a0Antarctic Sea ice is disappearing\u00a0as our planet warms up.",
      "\"They show up at the breeding season and the ice isn't there, so they have nowhere to breed,\" Dr. Birgitte McDonald, an ecologist at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, which is funded and administered by San Jose State University,\u00a0told CBS San Francisco\u00a0last year.",
      "An analysis by scientists at Cambridge University, published last year\u00a0in the journal Science News, found that \"ice in one area was melting especially early in the year,\" putting emperor chicks at extreme risk.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

    "summary": "Conservationists are teaming up with the U.S. Forest Service and logging companies to clear scorched land and make room for new reforestation projects.",
    "story": [
      "Medford, Oregon \u2014 In the heart of Southern Oregon's Fremont-Winema National Forest, crews are going to new heights to harvest a precious commodity.",
      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",
      "The demand for stock now requires all hands on deck. Logging companies like Collins Pine are helping the Forest Service source pine cones and clear scorched land for replanting.",
      "\"Fire and ecology and insects and disease \u2014 it doesn't care about a property line. So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",
      "Neighbors are helping neighbors in a program the Forest Service hopes to expand to other impacted states.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",

      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons. Strikes by ships, entanglements in\u00a0fishing gear, underwater noise and the effects of climate change are among the threats that fin whales face, according to the agency.",
      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",
      "Daisy Grandlinard was among the parents who accompanied a group of children to see the whale Monday. As they drew closer, they could smell it, she said.",
      "\"It was really interesting for the kids to be able to feel it, touch the bottom because it kind of had tracks on it, like a sled almost. And just to see the size of it, that was pretty cool,\" she said. \"We had already studied whales a couple of weeks ago, so it was fun to see one in person and say, 'Oh, that's what the baleen looks like in real life,' and 'Where is the blow hole?'\"",

      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",

Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

    "summary": "Daisy's mission is two-fold: To waste scammers' time so they can't speak to real people and to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant.",
    "story": [
      "Meet Daisy \u2013 an AI-generated grandma created by British phone company Virgin Media O2 as the ultimate scam buster. Daisy's sole purpose is to talk to scammers all day so real people don't have to.",
      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",

He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",

      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",

      "In a service post, Reddit said it's aware of a \"degraded service\" for users of its website and app, and added that it's investigating the issue.",
      "Reddit users began reporting problems accessing the site at about 3 p.m. ET on Wednesday, with the number of reports spiking to almost 50,000 shortly after. As of 5:30 p.m., some users were still having trouble connecting to Reddit, with the website displaying a message reading, \"Our CDN [content delivery network] was unable to reach our servers.\"",
      "In a statement emailed to CBS News, Reddit said the service is coming back online. \"There was a bug in a recent update we made, but a fix is in place and we're ramping back up,\" the company said.",
      "Reddit, which went public in March, last month reported its first profit as a publicly traded company. The social media service also reported that its daily users surged 47% to 97.2 million compared with the same time last year.",
      "Is Bluesky also down?",
      "DownDetector also reported that Bluesky, which is a service similar to X, experienced problems on Wednesday.",

      "In a Wednesday post, Bluesky said it had experienced \"some technical difficulties today,\" but said the service had returned. The service has signed up more than 20 million users, with one million new users joining each day during the past few days, Bluesky said on Tuesday. Many of those new users are disgruntled X users.",

You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\"",
      "Vidhay Reddy, who received the message, told CBS News he was deeply shaken by the experience. \"This seemed very direct. So it definitely scared me, for more than a day, I would say.\"",
      "The 29-year-old student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who said they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"",
      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" she said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",
      "Her brother believes tech companies need to be held accountable for such incidents. \"I think there's the question of liability of harm. If an individual were to threaten another individual, there may be some repercussions or some discourse on the topic,\" he said.",
      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",
      "While Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.",
      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.",
      "Google said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.",
      "However, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs.

      "Some users on Reddit and other discussion forums claim the response from Gemini may have been programmed through user manipulation \u2014 either by triggering a specific response, prompt injection, or altering the output.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

      "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Guthrie announced the death on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records label.",
      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump nominated Dr. Marty Makary Friday to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who opposed vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Makary, a Johns Hopkins University professor, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system to be \"broken\" and in need of a shakeup.",
      "Makary has criticized in books and articles the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "\"I'm a part of a generation that says, 'We as a medical generation have made some mistakes, we've done things that resulted in a loss of the public trust and we need to be open and honest about our problems if we're going to fix it,'\" Markey\u00a0said\u00a0in a 2012 interview with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Trump announced the nomination in a statement Friday night, saying Makary would \"restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\" Makary will have to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though he was not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, Makary had concerns about vaccinations in young children.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, Makary was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "In a February 2021 Wall Street Journal piece, he wrote that \"COVID will be mostly gone by April, allowing Americans to resume normal life.\" That summer the delta variant of the virus ripped through the U.S., followed by omicron in the winter, leading to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.",
      "If Makary is confirmed and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also confirmed as Trump's pick to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, Makary would likely report to Kennedy. Makary does not share Kennedy's discredited views on vaccines, but he has a similar distrust of the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Makary has lamented that drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers.

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 19:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",
      "\"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.",
      "Politics also runs in his family, as former Rep. John Jenrette was his uncle and is also known for serving a prison sentence for his role in 1980s Abscam scandal, South Carolina's Post and Courier reported.",

    "summary": "Trump's new lawyers will have to decide how to handle hot-button issues before the high court this term, including cases on treatments for transgender youth and on ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court convenes for arguments in December, the justices will hear from the top lawyer for the Biden administration, who will urge them to strike down laws in nearly half the states that ban hormone treatments for transgender minors.",
      "In January, President-elect Donald Trump's new lawyers at the Justice Department will have to decide if the federal government still believes those laws are unconstitutional.",
      "How to handle ongoing cases before the Supreme Court is always one of the most consequential questions for a new presidential administration. It's a big task. Of the 45 cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear for its current term, which began in October, the United States is party to 21 of them, including the case over certain treatments for transgender youth. In many others, the Biden administration has outlined its view of the legal issues.",
      "In most of those cases, the Justice Department takes a predictable, even nonpartisan approach, such as by routinely defending federal criminal prosecutions on appeal.",
      "But other cases involve judgment calls that reflect the new administration's policy preferences.",
      "In addition to the transgender case, many others touch on hot-button issues: the Biden administration supported a federal regulation of ghost guns, which are weapons that people can buy in pieces and put together at home; it opposed a lower court's ban on a Texas law that requires people who access pornographic websites to prove they are adults; and it defended the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize flavored e-cigarette products for sale.",
      "But Trump's lawyers can flip these positions. As Chief Justice John Roberts noted in 2022, \"a new administration is of course as a general matter entitled to do that.\"",
      "How does it work? That depends.",
      "If the United States lost the case in the lower court, the new lawyers can simply dismiss the appeal.",
      "The Biden administration took this approach in a prominent 2020 abortion case over Trump's decision to bar federally funded health clinics from making abortion referrals. When a lower court struck down the policy, Trump's lawyers brought it to the Supreme Court, which agreed to consider the issue.. But after President Biden took office in early 2021, his legal team dropped the appeal and the case was removed from the Supreme Court's calendar.",
      "The Trump administration will now have to decide whether to withdraw its appeal in the transgender case. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, a Biden appointee who argues on behalf of the government before the Supreme Court, has argued that state laws that keep minors from taking hormones \"discriminate[] based on transgender status.\" Trump, who campaigned on getting \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools,\" is unlikely to see the issue the same way.",
      "But Trump's lawyers may consider staying the course if it looks like the Supreme Court disagrees with the Biden administration's position at oral argument early next month. This prospect seems likely because the ACLU is poised to pursue the case if the government drops out, making withdrawal by the new Trump administration potentially futile.",
      "The Trump administration's approach to the ghost-guns case is also unclear. At oral argument in October, the justices indicated that they had no issue with the Biden administration's regulations on these do-it-yourself weapons, buoying the spirits of gun-control advocates. If the Trump administration opposes the regulations on ghost guns, which subject these weapons to the same requirements as firearms sold commercially, it could dismiss the case, which would keep intact a lower court ruling that blocked the rule.",
      "In contrast, if another party is appealing a case that the U.S. won in the lower court, the approach of Trump's lawyers may depend on different factors.",
      "One factor is how far the case has progressed. In January 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a criminal-sentencing case. But before the parties submitted briefs outlining their arguments in the case, the Biden administration told the Supreme Court that \"following the change in administration, the Department of Justice began a process of reviewing the government's interpretation of\" the law and reversed course. The Supreme Court then appointed an outside lawyer to argue the Trump administration's previous position.",
      "And regardless, the Supreme Court's caseload may change if Trump rolls back Mr. Biden's policies. In 2017, Trump, in his first term, dropped former President Barack Obama's policy for bathroom use for transgender students right before a Republican challenge to the guidance landed at the Supreme Court, which brought an end to the case.",
      "Trump's new lawyers will have to make strategic choices against this backdrop.",
      "Some may involve how to portray the government's interests. The Supreme Court sometimes asks Justice Department lawyers to explain how a pending ruling might affect the government. Several of these kinds of requests are outstanding, including a Honolulu challenge that seeks to hold oil and gas companies accountable for the effects of emissions on the climate.",
      "And some choices might not even result in any change to the Supreme Court's current docket. One of the administration's jobs is to ask the high court to review upcoming cases. Trump's new lawyers may withdraw \u2014 or simply never pursue \u2014 certain appeals that the Biden administration teed up.",

More than 40% of the nation's roughly 300 million egg-laying hens are raised in cage-free facilities, but roughly 60% of \"bird flu\" cases recently detected involved cage-free farms.",
      "\"After two months of no outbreaks, we had them recently in Utah, Oregon, California and Washington, and three of those states are exclusively cage-free,\" Emily Metz, chief executive and president of the American Egg Board, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Where we are hearing reports of shortages it's at stores like a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.\"",
      "After a brief respite from bird flu among commercial-egg producers, HPAI struck again starting in mid-October, resulting in the loss of 2.8 million birds. The nation's egg production fell 2.6% last month from a year ago and is projected to be down 1% this year versus 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service recently said in a monthly\u00a0report.",
      "The outbreaks, which began in January of 2022, have affected nearly 110 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, including wild, commercial and backyard flocks in 49 states, according\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the first time HPAI, also known as H5N1,\u00a0had been detected in the U.S. since 2016.",
      "The return of bird flu is wiping out poultry populations at commercial facilities in multiple states, most recently striking more than a million egg-laying hens in California's Kern County, where HPAI had been confirmed in 2.2 million egg-laying hens the prior week, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "More than 790,000 egg layers were also culled last week at a commercial operation in Arizona's Pinal County.",
      "How long do shortages last?",
      "The tighter egg supplies means the U.S. is experiencing \"hyper-localized shortages that are very temporary and intermittent and that are corrected sometimes within a day,\" said Metz, whose board markets and promotes eggs and egg products.",
      "\"There are local areas where supplies aren't quite as strong, so you might see pockets where shelves get picked over,\" said Brent Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "After HPAI-related shortages drove up egg prices in the spring, the virus is having the same impact this winter. Experts forecast that egg prices could stay elevated for the rest of the year and into 2025.",
      "As with the cost of other commodities, egg prices fluctuate with supply and demand, the latter of which has remained fairly stable over the year, regardless of cost, according to the Farm Bureau's Nelson. The egg board, however, said America's appetite for the protein has grown of late, rising steadily for 20 consecutive quarters.",
      "\"We see egg prices ride the wave as bird flu comes and goes,\" Nelson said. Right now, \"Bird flu infections are by far the biggest factor impacting egg prices.\"",
      "The national average for a dozen eggs is $3.37, up 30% from a year ago but lower than the January 2023 average of $4.82, the economist said. But some regions are seeing even higher prices. In California, white cage-free eggs were selling for about $5.26 a dozen last week \u2014 up nearly 90% from $2.81 during the same time in 2023, according to the USDA.",
      "Despite the price spikes, Nelson and Metz advised consumers against hoarding a perishable product like eggs, emphasizing that shortages typically pass quickly as retailers replenish their supplies.",
      "\"Eggs keep in the fridge really well \u2014 if you need them, go and get them,\" said Nelson.",
      "Added Metz, \"There is a hen for almost every person in the U.S., if they are not in the supermarket today, come back tomorrow.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

      "Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, an Indian national who prosecutors say went by the alias \"Dirty Harry,\" and Steve Shand, 50, an American from Florida, were part of a sophisticated illegal operation that has been bringing increasing numbers of Indians into the U.S, prosecutors said.",
      "Federal prosecutors said a family of four \u2014 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik \u2014 froze to death Jan. 19, 2022, while trying to cross the border into Minnesota in a scheme organized by Patel and Shand. Patel is a common Indian surname, and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel.",
      "\"To earn a few thousand dollars, these traffickers put men, women and children in extraordinary peril leading to the horrific and tragic deaths of an entire family,\" U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said shortly after the verdict was reached Friday.",
      "Before the jury's conviction on Friday, the federal trial in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, saw testimony from an alleged participant in the smuggling ring, a survivor of the treacherous journey across the northern border, border patrol agents and forensic experts.",
      "\"The words immoral depravity are the best that I have to describe the conduct that led to this terrible, terrible result,\" Luger said.",
      "Defense attorneys were pitted against each other, with Shand's team arguing that he was unwittingly roped into the scheme by Patel. Patel's lawyers, The Canadian Press\u00a0reported, said their client had been misidentified. They said \"Dirty Hary,\" the alleged nickname for Patel found in Shand's phone, is a different person. Bank records and witness testimony from those who encountered Shand near the border don't tie him to the crime, they added.",
      "Prosecutors said Patel was the coordinator of the operation while Shand was a driver. Shand was to pick up 11 Indian migrants on the Minnesota side of the Canadian border, prosecutors said. Only seven survived the foot crossing. Canadian authorities found two parents and their young children later that morning, dead from the cold.",
      "The men could face maximum sentences as long as 20 years for the first two counts, 10 years for the third count and five years for the fourth count, the U.S. Attorney's Office told The Associated Press before the trial.

      "Parent company Ahold Delhaize said in a statement earlier this month, that it had alerted law enforcement about the cyber breach and had taken some systems offline. \"While there may be some limited inventory for certain products, we are working to re-stock our shelves and anticipate item availability to continue to improve over the next few days,\" the company said. But the incident may be a sign of things to come during the holiday season, when cybersecurity crises are likely to peak.",
      "Already this year, corporate giants like AT&T, Ticketmaster and United Health have suffered paralyzing cyberattacks, and now, businesses are bracing for the holidays, a time when many cybersecurity operations rely on skeleton staffing. But the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning that it's no time for them to be taking a \"cyber vacation.\"",
      "The vast majority of ransomware attacks that hobbled businesses and organizations over the past year \u2014 86% \u2014\u00a0 occurred on a weekend or holiday, according to a new global study of 900 IT and security professionals released this week by cybersecurity firm Semperis. But researchers also found that 85% of surveyed organizations \u2014 90% in the U.S. \u2014 reduce security staffing by as much as 50% during those same periods.",
      "\"This study would say that we're not making thoughtful choices,\" former White House \"cyber czar\" and Semperis strategic adviser Chris Inglis told CBS News. \"If you realize that most of these attacks take place on holidays and weekends and you reduce your manning, you take away your opportunity to essentially have parity with your adversaries,\" said Inglis. He added, \"The advantage goes to the attacker, because they're not taking a day off. They never take a day off.\"",

      "With financial executives predicting that President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House could usher in a wave of bank mergers and acquisitions, cybersecurity experts worry that cybercriminals will be able to take advantage of these \"moments of distraction.\"",
      "\"Our adversaries \u2013 be they criminal or foreign, rogue nations \u2013 they test the waters every day.

So we can expect that they will do what they always do. It's not that they search at this moment, it's that they see their opportunities being perhaps more productive at this moment.\"",
      "In February, UnitedHealth Group suffered the biggest hack in U.S. healthcare history after its acquisition of Change Healthcare meant it inherited outdated technology, with digital systems not yet safeguarded by multi-factor authentication.",
      "Beyond an anticipated onslaught of big bank deals, changes in administration \u2013 regardless of politics \u2013 have historically enticed foreign adversaries to test the defenses of new leadership in Washington. In 2021, President Joe Biden inherited fallout from a sophisticated Russian cyberattack leveled against Texas software-maker SolarWinds and used to breach roughly 100 top U.S. companies and a dozen government agencies.",

      "Contributing to cybersecurity staffing headaches, cybersecurity workforce growth worldwide has flatlined for the first time since 2019. With growth of just 0.1% year-over-year in 2024, budget cuts, layoffs and hiring freezes have exacerbated a global staffing shortage of cybersecurity professionals, according to a recent report released by ISC2.",

      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",

      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

The case echoed the ongoing high-profile trial that has shocked the nation in which 51 men are accused of raping Gisele Pelicot, drugged by her husband so he could invite strangers to their home to abuse her.",
      "The 38-year-old father was convicted by the court in the southeast Var region of forcing sexual acts on his daughter from the age of 13. Prosecutor Estelle Bois described how the father exercised total control over the young girl, his adoptive daughter. He also brought her to other men, many of them much older, who he contacted through online classified ads.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities have seen a surge of guns and ammunition flowing from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean, fueling conflict in regions already struggling with violence and unrest.",
      "Last week, U.S.-based airlines were struck by gunfire while flying over Haiti's airspace. While the origin of the firearms remains uncertain, Haiti has no domestic firearms manufacturing capacity, and aside from a small artisanal market, the majority of weapons fueling the violence are likely sourced from the U.S.",
      "A new report from research organization Small Arms Survey reveals a staggering nearly 120% surge in firearm shipments seized en route from the U.S. to the Caribbean and Latin America since 2016.",
      "\"Available evidence indicates that traffickers in the U.S. are a major source of illicit weapons in the Caribbean and Latin America,\" said Matt Schroeder, senior researcher at Small Arms Survey and author of the report. \"The illicit acquisition and use of firearms in the Caribbean and Latin America ranks among the most pressing security threats in the hemisphere.\"",
      "Their analysis, based on previously unpublished border seizure data obtained through public records requests, highlights a growing problem. These figures represent only the weapons actually seized, leaving out the vast number of guns trafficked across the U.S. or uncovered through criminal investigations. While it's unclear if these increases reflect more thorough screening, a rise in trafficking or improved data collection, the trend unmistakably points to a consistent demand for illicit firearms.",
      "The black market of American guns and ammunition has been well-established by U.S. and international law enforcement as a key source of weapons fueling humanitarian crises and violence in places like Mexico, Haiti and beyond. A 2023 CBS Reports investigation found up to a million firearms are smuggled across the border annually, including military-grade weapons like grenade launchers and belt-fed Gatling-style miniguns.",
      "The illicit flow of firearms is now a major concern across the Caribbean as well. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office shows that U.S.-sourced firearms account for the vast majority of the violence in Caribbean nations. The report states that 73% of the firearms recovered in the Caribbean between 2018 and 2023 were traced back to the U.S., with a significant portion of these weapons sold in Florida, Georgia and Texas. These firearms are responsible for 90% of homicides in some of the region's most vulnerable nations.",
      "The Small Arms Survey's latest findings reflect these broader trends, highlighting an increase in rifles seized as percentage of all interdicted firearms.",
      "Of the seized rifles headed for the Caribbean, 77% were AK- and AR-style rifles, compared with 48% in shipments to Mexico and 61% to other Latin American countries \u2014 though the total number of rifles seized while heading to the Caribbean remains lower than the quantities seized in shipments to Latin America. In the Caribbean-bound shipments, 93% of the magazines that were identifiable by capacity were capable of holding more than 10 rounds, making them high-capacity magazines.",

    "title": "Russia hits back after Ukraine's strike using U.S. long-range missiles",
    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Dnipro bears the brunt of Moscow's first retaliatory strike after Ukraine fires U.S.-made missiles into Russia, and Ukraine claims Moscow may have used an ICBM.",
    "story": [
      "Russia launched a barrage of missiles at Ukraine Thursday in its first major retaliation for Ukraine's attack earlier in the week on a military facility in the Russian region of Bryansk. That strike saw the Ukrainians use American-made and supplied long-range missiles known as ATACMS, which President Biden had given the Ukrainian forces permission to fire deeper into Russian territory only two days earlier.",
      "Moscow had warned the U.S. and its NATO allies for months against granting Ukraine permission to fire Western missiles into Russia, and Mr. Biden's weekend decision to permit such strikes drew stark new warnings from lawmakers and Russian media close to President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. was escalating the nearly three-year conflict at the risk of sparking a new world war.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have argued that it's Putin escalating the war he started by ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, including by deploying more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers to bolster his own forces in recent weeks. But there was little doubt that Moscow would respond to the Ukrainians' first use of the American ATACMS to strike inside Russia somehow, and air raid sirens blared across the country Wednesday as the U.S. closed its embassy in Kyiv and warned of a possible imminent \"significant air attack.\"",
      "The attack didn't come on Wednesday, but rather overnight, with Russian missiles targeting several cities but hitting central-eastern Dnipro the hardest. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed that Russia's assault on the city included its first use during the war of an intercontinental ballistic missile, though a Western official told CBS News on Thursday that an ICBM was not used in the strike.",
      "Two U.S. officials also told CBS News that Russia had fired a ballistic missile, not an ICBM on Thursday, with one saying it appeared to have been an intermediate range ballistic missile launched from just east of Volgograd, Russia, to target Dnipro. If accurate, that would be a flight path of about 500 miles.",
      "Despite the denials from U.S. officials, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on social media that \"all the characteristics\" of a Russian missile used in the strike on Dnipro \"corresponds to an intercontinental ballistic missile,\" though he said an investigation was underway to confirm exactly what had been fired at the city.",
      "Zelenskyy accused \"our crazy neighbor\" Russia of using his country \"as a testing ground\" for its new weapons.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News later Thursday that Russia was believed to have launched an experimental intermediate range ballistic missile based on the country's RS-26 Rubezh missile.",
      "The U.S. was notified prior to the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels, the official said, adding that the U.S. had briefed Ukraine and close allies and partners in recent days about the possibility that Russia could use such a weapon in order to help them prepare.",
      "Russia is likely to only possess a handful of the experimental weapons, the official said, noting that Ukraine has withstood countless Russian attacks with missiles that had significantly larger warheads that this experimental IRBM.",
      "The official also added that President Biden earlier this year said the U.S. was providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defenses, many of which have already been delivered.",
      "During a live televised news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova received a phone call and a man identified only as \"Masha\" could be heard ordering her not to make any comment on the \"ballistic missile strike that the Westerners have started talking about\" in Dnipro.",
      "The Ukrainian air force did not say what the purported Russian ICBM had targeted or whether it had caused any damage, but the Dnipro regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said the strike damaged an industrial enterprise and ignited fires in the city, wounding 15 people.",
      "The Ukrainian Air Force said the Russian attack also included a Kinzhal hypersonic missile and seven cruise missiles \u2014 all weapons used many times previously by Russia during the war. Six of the Russian missiles were shot down, the air force said.",
      "The strike came hours after the CBS News team in Kyiv, along with hundreds of thousands of residents of the Ukrainian capital, were forced to scramble for cover in underground parking lots, metro stations and basements on Wednesday as air raid alarms sounded.",
      "In the end, no missiles landed on Wednesday, leaving Ukraine to accuse Russia of a psychological attack.",
      "\"We are very worried,\" one young Kyiv resident told CBS News. \"We want to keep our country. We want to live in peace.\"",
      "After more than two and a half years of war in Ukraine, the scars and the anxiety run deep.",
      "\"It could happen any minute, any hour,\" Major Taras Berezovets, of Ukraine's Territorial Defense force, told CBS News, arguing that Russia and Putin are blackmailing his country, trying to frighten Ukrainians into surrendering \u2013 \"trying to make the conclusion that any sort of opposition to Russian invasion is absolutely useless.\"",
      "Some believe both Russia and Ukraine are trying to maximize their gains \u2014 and with them, their leverage for any future cease-fire talks \u2014 before President-elect Donald Trump comes back into office in January.",
      "There's significant fear in Ukraine and in European capitals that Trump could cut U.S. support for Kyiv, forcing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government to accept a negotiated truce with Russia that sees Ukraine give up land occupied by Putin's forces.",

      "Ahmad said Israeli tanks were nearby and an Israeli drone watched the entire attack unfold.",
      "However, Israel's military says it is not responsible for protecting the aid convoys, a premise with which former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert disagrees.",
      "\"The Israeli government doesn't want it to happen. They want to punish the Palestinians, because the basic premise is that all of the Palestinians in Gaza support the terrorists and therefore they all should be punished,\" Olmert told CBS News, adding that if the Israeli army is able to build roads in Gaza, it should be \"capable of making the necessary logistical arrangements\" to provide humanitarian support for the people that live there.",
      "On Thursday, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Mohammed Deif, a Hamas leader who Israel claims was killed in a July airstrike.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

      "Police said in a brief statement that the Supreme Court had agreed to reveal the names of all 37 people who were indicted \"to avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.\" The 700-page police document likely will take several days for the court to review, Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes said.",
      "Dozens of former and current Bolsonaro aides also were indicted, including Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who was his running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander Gen. Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno.",

      "The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, along with Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, whom Israel has\u00a0said was killed in an airstrike in July.",
      "Judges found there were \"reasonable grounds to believe that\" both Netanyahu and Gallant \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,\" when the ICC prosecutor filed applications for the arrest warrants, the ICC said in a statement Thursday.",

      "Judges at the United Nations court \"found that their conduct led to the disruption of the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential goods to the population in need in Gaza. The aforementioned restrictions together with cutting off electricity and reducing fuel supply also had a severe impact on the availability of water in Gaza and the ability of hospitals to provide medical care.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas respond to ICC arrest warrants",
      "Israeli officials condemned the ICC prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant in May, and they were quick to lambast the issuing of the warrants on Thursday.",
      "Netanyahu's office issued a scathing statement dismissing the ICC as antisemitic and claiming its chief prosecutor had only sought the warrants in the first place to distract from sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "\"Israel rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions and charges against it by the International Criminal Court, which is a biased and discriminatory political body,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza... after the terrorist organization Hamas launched a murderous attack against it, committing the greatest massacre committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\"",
      "\"No anti-Israeli decision will prevent the State of Israel from protecting its citizens,\" the statement said, adding that Netanyahu himself would \"not give in to pressure, will not back down, and will not retreat until all the war goals that Israel set at the start of the campaign are achieved.\"",
      "Gallant, in a statement, said the court's decision had put Israel and \"the murderous leaders of Hamas in the same row and thus legitimizes the murder of babies, the rape of women and the abduction of the elderly from their beds. The decision sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.\"",

      "About 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in that attack and some 250 others taken hostage.",
      "Hamas has not confirmed or denied Deif's killing in a July Israeli airstrike.",

      "What do the ICC arrest warrants mean practically?",
      "Theoretically, the arrest warrants could limit the movements of Netanyahu and Gallant, as any of the 124 member states where the court has jurisdiction would be obligated to arrest them. Deif, if he's still alive, would already have his movements restricted inside Gaza as Israel's military operations there continue.",
      "The ICC does not have a police force, so any arrest would be at the discretion of local law enforcement in member states. Israel and the United States are not signatories, so they do not fall under the jurisdiction of the court.",

      "An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the U.S. on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
      "Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government \u2014 enough to light millions of homes and businesses.",
      "The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants of playing two sides of the deal.",
      "It accuses them of portraying it as rosy and above-board to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing.",
      "Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to \"obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said.",
      "In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

      "1. Genomic instability: This occurs when damaged DNA leads to diseases like cancer and weakens the body\u2019s ability to heal, according to the doctor.",
      "2. Telomere attrition: Shorter telomeres (DNA sequences at the end of a chromosome) are what cause visible aging signs like wrinkles and slower cell regeneration.",
      "3. Epigenetic alteration: This is when environmental factors alter gene function, accelerating skin aging and metabolic issues, Zalzala said.",

      "10. Disabled macroautophagy: This is a slowdown of the process that provides metabolites and energy to cells, according to ScienceDirect.",
      "11. Chronic inflammation: As people grow older, an increase in inflammation is directly linked to the development of many diseases and effects of aging, experts agree.",

      "\"I think I've been opposed to the death penalty my whole life as I've thought about its use, and should it exist in our society,\" Bucy said, according to Fox 7.",
      "\"Financially, if you just want to look at it economically, we spend more money to execute than to keep someone in prison, so it's really a lose-lose situation with a high risk stake if we get it wrong,\" he continued.",

      "Photo shows the gurney in the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)",
      "This comes after the Texas Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the state to schedule a new execution date for inmate Robert Roberson, whose initial execution was delayed last month.",
      "Roberson is currently on death row over his conviction in which prosecutors say he killed his two-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, by shaking her to death, known as shaken baby syndrome. But his lawyers say Nikki actually died from other health issues such as pneumonia and that new evidence proves his innocence. His lawyers also said doctors had failed to rule out these other medical explanations for the child's symptoms.",
      "Roberson was scheduled to be put to death on Oct. 17 before the state Supreme Court issued a stay to delay his execution shortly before it was set to take place.",
      "If he is put to death, he would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed in a case based on shaken baby syndrome.",
      "More than 80 Texas state lawmakers, as well as the detective who helped the prosecution, medical experts, parental rights groups, human rights groups, bestselling novelist John Grisham and other advocates have called for the state to grant Roberson clemency over the belief that he is innocent. A group of state lawmakers have also visited Roberson in prison to encourage him.",

      "\"Which is far more than any other state in the nation,\" Houle Cuellar told Fox 7. \"We have quite a reputation when it comes to the use of the death penalty in Texas.\"",
      "Houle Cuellar said that there have been fewer death sentences in the state in the last decade, which she partially attributes to the introduction in 2005 of life without parole.",
      "\"Prosecutors have used that discretion in opting not to seek the death penalty,\" Houle Cuellar said. \"Even in about 30 percent of the cases that they've taken to trial where they've sought the death penalty, jurors have rejected it.\"",
      "Houle Cuellar said that Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Bexar counties lead the state in death sentences and more than half of all Texas counties have never issued a death sentence.",
      "Since 2007, multiple Texas lawmakers have unsuccessfully sought to abolish the death penalty. But Bucy says there is now enough momentum regarding the issue to reintroduce legislation to eliminate the practice.",

      "State Sen. Sarah Eckhardt and state Rep. Joe Moody, both Democrats, have filed similar bills to abolish the death penalty, which will need to be voted on by fellow lawmakers when the legislative session begins early next year.",
      "In another Texas death row case, a judge found last month that Melissa Lucio was innocent in the 2007 death of her two-year-old daughter, Mariah. Senior State District Judge Arturo Nelson recommended that Lucio's conviction and death sentence be overturned. The judge also found that prosecutors suppressed evidence and testimony, including statements from Lucio's other children, that could support the claim that she was not abusive and that Mariah's death was accidental from falling down the stairs."

      "While the prospect of hypersonic travel is exciting, there are several challenges to overcome. The Stargazer is estimated to cost $33 million and will have a limited passenger capacity of 12. There are also potential issues with sonic booms over populated areas and regulatory hurdles in obtaining approval for commercial hypersonic flight. However, Venus Aerospace is moving swiftly to bring their vision to reality. The Stargazer is projected to be available for commercial use in the 2030s.",

    "summary": "Porch pirates are on the prowl this holiday season. Tech guru Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson has a number of tips to prevent holiday package thefts.",
    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of gift-giving can quickly turn into anxiety over package theft. With porch pirates on the prowl, your carefully delivered gifts can vanish right from your doorstep. In 2023 alone, a staggering\u00a0119 million packages were reported stolen, meaning one in every 180 deliveries disappeared into thin air.",
      "Cities like Seattle, Memphis and San Diego have become hot spots for these unfortunate heists.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself racing home to rescue a package, asking neighbors to keep an eye out or, worst of all, falling victim to these sneaky thieves, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got some tips that could save you from the holiday headache of package theft. Let\u2019s dive in.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",
      "Pro tip: If your camera has the feature, set your video camera to notify you when it identifies packages within view.",
      "GET MORE OF MY TOP PICKS TO AMP UP YOUR HOME SECURITY",
      "Image of a doorbell camera (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 2: Use tracking apps",
      "Next up, make sure you're using tracking apps for your deliveries. Most shipping companies offer tracking services that let you follow your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at your home.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "If you sign up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, you\u2019ll get digital previews of what\u2019s coming to your mailbox, which is super handy. You can set up email or text alerts for delivery updates so you\u2019re always in the loop about when your packages are arriving. Some retailers even send you photos once your package has been delivered, giving you extra reassurance that it made it safely.",
      "A woman using a tracking app on her iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY LAPTOP DEALS",
      "Tip 3: Make sure someone is home",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected. If that\u2019s not possible, coordinate with friends, family members or roommates so someone is always there to grab\u00a0the delivery right away.",

      "BEST HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS",
      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",

      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",
      "KURT\u2019S UNBEATABLE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS",
      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",
      "When you're checking out, just click on\u00a0Change next to your shipping address, then select\u00a0Find a pickup location near you to see your options. Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",
      "A person picking up a package from a locker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 8: Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery",
      "We added a strong deadbolt to the door leading into the house from the garage before signing up. Now, when we are not home, an Amazon delivery can be placed securely inside our garage using the free service called Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery. The addition of a\u00a0smart garage controller is the first step. Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",
      "A delivery being made using Amazon Key-In-Garage Delivery (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 9: Provide a delivery box",
      "Another great option is to invest in a\u00a0delivery box that allows packages to be securely dropped off and stored discreetly. Just remember that you'll need to inform delivery personnel about using the box and how it works.",
      "Package being placed in a delivery box (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 10: Sign up for delivery notifications",
      "You can get an alert each time a package arrives at your doorstep.\u00a0Both FedEx and UPS will send a text when you've just received a delivery.\u00a0Amazon will also send you a shipment text letting you know a package has just been delivered.",

      "Red imported fire ants may be small, but their impact is anything but trivial.

The research team trained the CyberDog using a comprehensive dataset of over 1,100 images of fire ant nests, resulting in an impressive detection accuracy rate of over 90%.",
      "The robot is programmed to poke suspected nests with its paw; when it does so, active nests release their workers in a defensive frenzy, confirming the presence of fire ants. This unique method allows researchers to distinguish between active mounds and those that may be abandoned or occupied by other species.",

      "iOS 18.1 brings a slew of AI-powered features aimed at enhancing your experience with Siri and Apple Intelligence, but it\u2019s worth questioning: How much does your iPhone really need to know about you? If you're like most people, privacy is a top priority, especially when it comes to sensitive data such as banking information, health details and your location.",
      "When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it starts \"learning\" from your interactions with certain apps, creating a digital profile that can theoretically tailor your experience. This is a double-edged sword; while personalization might sound appealing, it\u2019s crucial to consider what data Apple\u2019s AI is learning and why you might want to limit its reach.",

Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the National Security Agency advises weekly phone reboots to protect against cyberattacks and enhance mobile security.",
      "The telecom industry is one of cybercriminals' favorite targets, likely because of the sensitive data it stores. Your carrier knows who you call and what you text. This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "T-Mobile booth (T-Mobile) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",
      "WSJ reported in October that Chinese hackers had access to the networks \"for months or longer,\" enabling them to collect \"internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small and millions of Americans as their customers.\"",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "T-Mobile\u2019s many data breaches",
      "T-Mobile has faced several hacks in recent years. In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data. Then, in January 2023, a misconfigured application programming interface exposed personal data for 37 million current customers, marking yet another significant security lapse.",

Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced. We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities.\"",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "5 ways to stay safe when searching something on Google",
      "1. Avoid clicking on ads and suspicious links: Be cautious of ads or unfamiliar links at the top of search results. Hackers often use SEO poisoning to place dangerous links in prominent positions. So, try to stick with trusted websites and known sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to track your online activity and searches. Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "3. Enable SafeSearch: Google\u2019s SafeSearch filters help to block explicit or potentially harmful content. It\u2019s especially useful for filtering out unsafe links and improving search safety.",
      "4. Limit personal data on Google: Adjust your Google account\u2019s privacy settings to minimize data collection, including search history, location tracking and ad personalization. You can access these settings in the \"My Activity\" section of your Google account.",
      "5. Use private browsing or clear your history: Using Incognito Mode or clearing your browsing history regularly can help reduce tracking of your searches. While it doesn\u2019t hide your activity from ISPs or law enforcement, it limits the data Google can store on your device.",

It\u2019s concerning how malicious websites that put users at risk are readily available on the first page of Google. Although the search giant has claimed to prioritize helpful content this year, the ease with which hackers manipulate search results suggests Google is doing quite the opposite.

      "\"Dr. Chundru's testimony may have been very interesting, but it was wrong,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"He described what can happen in sickle cell disease, not what happens in sickle cell trait, which Neely had. Eight percent of Black people in this country have sickle trait, which is a benign medical condition that rarely causes any symptoms, let alone death.\"",
      "At the autopsy, Harris found significant \"sickling\" on Neely's organs, she testified, and lawyers on both sides asked for an explanation. She said the condition did not contribute to Neely's death, and she blamed it solely on asphyxiation from the chokehold.",
      "\"Sickle trait red blood cells do sickle after death, when the body's oxygen supply disappears and can be seen at autopsy \u2013 as with Neely or with anyone with sickle trait dying from any condition,\" Baden said. \"It's a post-mortem artifact like rigor mortis. Further, death from sickle disease takes days of sickling to occur; it can't occur in seconds as happened to Neely.\"",

      "Demonstrators stormed the buildings on Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region, and demanded the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, who is backed by Moscow.

But a recent study by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration advocacy group, estimated that up to 4 million mixed-status families \u2014 where some members are undocumented and some are U.S. citizens \u2014 could be separated.",
      "In states like Arizona, Colorado and Pennsylvania, mixed-status families, asylum-seekers and advocates say they are planning for scenarios where children could be separated from their parents.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Lillie, a U.S. citizen who did not want to use her last name out of concern for her family\u2019s safety, has been married to her undocumented husband from Honduras for 10 years. Last week, she took her U.S.-born children to get their passports and plans to get a power of attorney drawn up in the event her husband gets deported, she said.",
      "\u201cIf something happens and my husband is detained or he\u2019s deported, it would be very difficult for me to get passports for my children, for our children, to be able to leave the country to go see him,\u201d she said.",
      "Her husband was detained back in 2017, during the last Trump administration, for about two\u00a0months. The experience has affected him \u201cmentally and emotionally,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s made it clear that if it were to happen again, it would not be \u2018Let\u2019s stay and fight,\u2019\u201d Lillie said.\u00a0\u201cIt would be \u2018Let\u2019s just go,\u2019 because he does not want to stay in detention again.\u201d",
      "Throughout his successful 2024 run for the presidency, Trump has rallied supporters on the promise that he would enact the largest mass deportation effort in American history. And while Trump has said he will begin by prioritizing criminal noncitizens for deportation, the former president and his incoming administration have not ruled out separating or deporting families.",
      "When asked by CBS News last month if there was a way to carry out mass deportations without separating families, Tom Homan, who has since been named as Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d said, \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d",
      "Specific mass deportation plans are still being developed by Trump and his transition team, but sources familiar with the planning told NBC News recently that restarting family detention and potentially building more detention facilities in nonborder U.S. cities are being considered.",
      "In Tucson, Arizona, the Coalici\u00f3n de Derechos Humanos, a group of more than 10 nonprofit organizations, is helping undocumented and mixed-status families create \u201cemergency packets\u201d ahead of potential mass deportations. The idea, organizers say, is partly based on past experiences where parents have been detained or deported while their children were in school.",
      "\u201cWe had cases where they made calls. We had cases where they were not able to get in touch with the mother, their friends,\u201d said coalition co-founder Isabel Garcia.",
      "The \u201cemergency packet,\u201d which coalition members are helping families make in local workshops, will include key documents such as a power of attorney for parental authority, family emergency contacts and a child\u2019s school records.",

      "\u201cMore people have come to our meetings. We have had more people calling us. We are now inundated with people,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Advocacy groups are also bracing for state-level changes to immigration enforcement that could result in deportations. Organizers for Coalici\u00f3n de Derechos Humanos in Tucson say they are bracing for the impact of Proposition 314, a hard-line state immigration and border enforcement law that Arizona voters passed in November.",
      "The measure makes it a state crime to enter Arizona between a port of entry illegally and allows local law enforcement to arrest noncitizens and state judges to order deportations. It also adds state penalties to acts like selling fentanyl that lead to the death of another person and presenting false information to an employer or a public benefits program.",
      "Proposition 314 is one of multiple immigration-related state laws passed in the U.S. to address what supporters say is a record-high number of illegal border crossings under the Biden administration.",
      "Scenes of asylum-seeker encampments in nonborder cities as well as high-profile crimes committed by immigrants contributed to immigration becoming a key issue in this year\u2019s election in states like Arizona that helped Trump return to the White House.",
      "Some sections of Arizona\u2019s Proposition 314 cannot go into effect until similar laws currently held up in court, like Texas\u2019 Senate Bill 4, are in effect for at least 60 consecutive days.

    "story": [
      "President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0on Friday named Russell Vought, a co-author of Project 2025 who served as a platform policy director for the Republican National Committee, as his pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "In a statement announcing his pick, Trump referred to Vought, who previously held the role in his first term, as \"an aggressive cost cutter and deregulator who will help us implement our America First Agenda across all Agencies.\"",
      "\"Russ knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government, and he will help us return Self Governance to the People,\" Trump said. \"We will restore fiscal sanity to our Nation, and unleash the American People to new levels of Prosperity and Ingenuity.\"",
      "Vought responded to Trump\u2019s nomination in a post to X on Friday night, saying, \u201cThank you @realDonaldTrump! There is unfinished business on behalf of the American people, and it\u2019s an honor of a lifetime to get the call again.\u201d",
      "In the chapter Vought authored for conservative blueprint Project 2025, he argued the OMB director \"should present a fiscal goal to the President early in the budget development process to address the federal government\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility.\"",
      "\"Though some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President\u2019s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies,\" he wrote.",
      "During an interview with Tucker Carlson posted on X this week, Vought advocated for the president taking greater control over government agencies, saying Trump \"has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible.\"",
      "\"We have to solve the woke and the weaponized bureaucracy and have the president take control of the executive branch,\" Vought said. \"There may be different strategies with each one of them, about how you dismantle them, but as an administration, the whole notion of an independent agency should be thrown out.\"",
      "Though Trump and many of his\u00a0allies\u00a0distanced themselves from Project 2025 \u2014 an initiative that includes policy proposals led by the right-leaning think tank Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups for a Republican administration \u2014\u00a0on the campaign trail, many people associated with the agenda have been tapped for positions in the incoming Trump administration. Some of those named have included Tom Homan as border czar, Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and John Ratcliffe as CIA director.",
      "If he is confirmed by the Senate, Vought will oversee budget and the execution of Trump's policies across executive departments and agencies.",
      "Stephen Miller, Trump's expected incoming deputy chief of staff, called Vought a \"transformative pick\" for the budget office.",
      "\"Russ Vought has been the guy for the last four years who\u2019s been developing the plan to take down the deep state,\" Miller said during a Fox News interview that aired Friday night. \"That\u2019s Russ, and he\u2019s going to be right there at OMB to execute that plan. This is, this is really incredible stuff.\"",
      "Vought previously served as director of the Office of Management during Trump's first term. He assumed the role after working as deputy director and acting director of that office before his Senate confirmation in July 2020.",
      "Trump also announced a flurry other key Cabinet picks on Friday night.",
      "He named former NFL player and Texas state Rep. Scott Turner as his nominee for housing and urban development secretary and Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore., to serve as labor secretary. Trump also nominated surgeon Marty Makary as commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration and said that he would select former Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., as his nominee to serve as director of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention alongside a slew of other picks.",
      "Trump also said that Sebastian Gorka, a former aide, would serve as deputy assistant and senior director for counterterrorism. Gorka previously served as a national security aide for Trump in 2017, a role that he held for less than a year. He faced criticism after donning the medal of the allegedly Nazi-linked Hungarian group Vitezi Rend to Trump's inaugural ball in 2017."

    "summary": "This year has seen some of the worst sales in decades for the art market, and the \u201cComedian\u201d piece is unlikely to move the needle one way or the other.",
    "story": [
      "For most art-world buyers, a work unsubtly called \u201cComedian\u201d lacked a certain a-peel.",
      "It\u2019s little wonder: \u201cComedian\u201d is actually just a banana duct-taped to a wall. Created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, the piece debuted at the 2019 Art Basel fair in Miami, where it caused a sensation but also earned as many chuckles as critical plaudits.",
      "But on Wednesday, Cattelan got the last laugh as \u201cComedian\u201d sold for $6.24 million, including $1 million in fees.",
      "The buyer was soon revealed to be Justin Sun, a 34-year old cryptocurrency platform founder from China and based in Switzerland. Sun confirmed the purchase on his X feed, writing that it represented \u201ca cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe this piece will inspire more thought and discussion in the future and will become a part of history,\u201d Sun wrote, adding he would personally eat the banana \u201cas part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture.\u201d",
      "A Sotheby\u2019s executive, meanwhile, hailed the purchase as emblematic of someone seeking to address art\u2019s biggest questions.",
      "\u201cHow do you value what, for me at least, is one of the most brilliant ideas in the history of conceptual art,\u201d David Galperin, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art for the Americas, said in a release. \u201cAnd what better place to ask that question than in our salesroom, where tonight the answer came in at a resounding\u00a0$6.2 million.\u201d",
      "Yet in much of the broader art world, Sun\u2019s winning bid was met with a shrug. Continuing a recent trend, 2024\u00a0has seen some of the worst sales in decades, and the purchase of \u201cComedian\u201d is unlikely to move the needle one way or the other, said Alex Glauber, founder of AWG Art Advisory and president of the Association of Professional Art Advisors.",
      "\u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u2019s an indication of anything,\u201d Glauber said of the \u201cComedian\u201d sale. He compared it to the purchase in 2017 of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvatore Mundi\u201d for a then-record $450 million, which occurred at a time when the demand for \u201cold masters,\u201d or classic, traditional artworks, was waning in favor of contemporary works.",
      "Likewise, \u201cComedian\u201d is being considered something of a one-off, Glauber said. While $6.24 million might seem like an eye-watering price for such a work, its very absurdity goes hand-in-hand with the nature of the piece and does not necessarily speak to wider purchasing trends.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about holding a mirror up to the art market, while channeling a legacy of conceptual art going back to Duchamp,\u201d Glauber said, referring to artist Marcel Duchamp, whose submission of a urinal he dubbed \u201cFountain\u201d to an art exhibition in 1917 is considered a foundational moment in conceptual art.",
      "\u201cSo in a way this work is self-reflexive \u2014\u00a0and the more it sold for, the more it proved its own concept.\u201d",
      "The rest of Sotheby\u2019s Wednesday auction is arguably more indicative of the art market\u2019s doldrums: Sotheby\u2019s \u201cNow\u201d portion of the evening, which showcases art produced in the last 20 years, saw\u00a0$16.5 million in total sales, beating estimates but coming in far below the $72.9 million seen for the equivalent \u201cNow\u201d auction in 2022, according to The New York Times.",
      "In a recent paper, Jianping Mei and Michael Moses of JP Mei & MA Moses Art Market Consultancy found that the average return on art sold in the first of half 2024 was just 0.1%, the lowest yield since 2000 \u2014 with half the works selling at a loss.",
      "\u201cHow bad is it? It\u2019s as bad as it gets,\u201d Moses told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult period for the art market.\u201d",
      "One big reason is simply that other investments, like stocks and gold, have seen far greater returns this century, Moses said.",
      "And while some who have capitalized on those assets will inevitably purchase art, artworks themselves have their own rates of return that depend more on evolutions in taste that don\u2019t correlate with wider macroeconomic trends.",
      "What \u201cComedian\u201d may signal instead is an expansion of the kinds of goods that cryptocurrencies can buy, as those financial instruments continue to witness stunning price increases. This year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled, and is now approaching $100,000.",
      "Sun, the \u201cComedian\u201d buyer, used his own cryptocurrency, TRX, to make the purchase, Sotheby\u2019s said. According to CoinMarketCap, the market value of all outstanding TRX coins as the sale occurred equated to more than $12 billion, with Sun himself boasting a net worth of $1.5 billion.",
      "According to the Robb Report, cryptocurrency use in high-end purchases for everything from real estate to yachts to jewelry has increased in turn.",
      "Yet even those purchases may not represent the norm. Robert Allen, a South Florida-based attorney who specializes in yacht deals, said people who are newly wealthy from cryptocurrency price increases appear to be prioritizing financial goals that were once previously attainable but which several years of soaring consumer prices and high interest rates have made more difficult.",
      "\u201cInflation has taken the American dream away from millennials and younger generations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for a certain sector that has invested in crypto, when it makes a hit, they\u2019re making down payments on houses, maybe taking a trip to Europe or around South America. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be an explosion in high-end luxury yet.\u201d"

The conference was set to end\u00a0Friday but negotiations over funding extended into the weekend.",
      "A draft of a deal to help the world adapt to and deal with climate change released at the conference, known as COP29, pledged $250 billion annually by 2035 from wealthy countries to poorer ones. While rich nations say it\u2019s realistic and about the limit of what they can do, it is less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather.",
      "The conference was already shadowed by the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement climate change treaty the first time he was president and has vowed to do so again. The atmosphere had also been dampened by poor attendance by world leaders, particularly from wealthy nations.",
      "Developing countries are seeking $1 trillion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from developed economies, to transition to green energy and adapt to extreme weather driven by climate change.",
      "As the World Meteorological Organization says 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, some experts are so worried they are calling for a completely new approach. In an open letter published last week, signatories including former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the whole framework of U.N. climate talks is \u201cno longer fit for purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can choose to be proactive about climate, and the time for being proactive is rapidly shrinking,\u201d said Ruth Townend, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House who attended the conference. \u201cOr we can choose to be reactive, which is much more expensive, much harder and has a higher human cost.\u201d",
      "Some of the highest human costs will be paid by smaller nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including Pacific Island nations whose existence is threatened by rising seas. But with COP29 weighed down by geopolitics and domestic turmoil, some were reluctant to attend at all.",
      "Deepening divides",
      "Top leaders from a number of major economies were notably absent in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.",
      "They included President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters. Though British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did attend, most other leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries did not, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "While the bulk of the work happens among lower-level negotiators during long nights in windowless rooms, the presence of heads of state has symbolic value, Townend said.",
      "\u201cIt is really disappointing to see that world leaders haven\u2019t shown up in force in solidarity,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite his physical absence, one person whose presence has been felt here is Trump.",
      "U.S. officials have sought to reassure conference attendees after Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "While Trump \u201cmay put climate action on the back burner,\u201d U.S. climate envoy John Podesta said, \u201cthe work to contain climate change is going to continue.\u201d",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said states, cities, nongovernmental organizations and companies are still \u201call-in\u201d on pursuing climate goals. She also noted that 80% of the funding from Biden\u2019s two signature bills, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has gone to Republican districts including to promote the manufacturing of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.",
      "She said Trump could slow, but not stop, U.S. climate efforts.",
      "\u201cIt would be political malpractice to undo those opportunities when people are just now getting hired,\u201d Granholm told NBC News. Some 400,000 people have been hired because of the bills, she added.",
      "Even companies that stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration have expressed concern. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said he hoped the Trump administration would take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to reducing emissions and remain in the Paris Agreement.",
      "Meeting the goals under the agreement, which include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures, could cost as much as $8 trillion annually, according to a report released last week by the Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance.",

      "On Friday, Florida\u2019s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced that communities in the state shouldn\u2019t add fluoride to drinking water because of what he called the \u201cneuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure.\u201d",
      "Fluoride has long been proven to drive down tooth decay by strengthening teeth, which Ladapo acknowledged in the guidance.",
      "But he added that there are also possible \u201csafety concerns related to systemic fluoride exposure,\u201d including reductions in IQ. While some studies have suggested potential links, the research is considered preliminary and far from definitive.",
      "The American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support the use of fluoridated water, calling it one of the top 10 public health achievements of the past century. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Once its benefits were proven, fluoride was also added to toothpaste and some mouthwashes. Dentists began giving kids fluoride treatments. Some communities are restoring fluoride to their water systems after seeing a rise in children\u2019s cavities.",
      "The anti-fluoride drumbeat has become louder in recent years. Communities have increasingly opted out of adding it to water, citing possible health risks.",
      "There are ongoing, active investigations about safe levels of fluoride exposure.",
      "\u201cRates of tooth decay are absolutely a concern,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada. \u201cBut science is evolving. There\u2019s growing evidence suggesting that fluoride may not be as safe as previously thought.\u201d",
      "Lanphear is an author of a 2019 study published in JAMA Pediatrics that found that mothers who drank fluoridated water while they were pregnant were more likely to have children with lower IQ levels.",
      "He and his colleagues concluded that pregnant women may want to avoid fluoride, but stopped short of advocating for its removal from water systems.",
      "About 70% of community water systems in Florida receive fluoridated water, according to the surgeon general\u2019s release.",
      "\u201cIt is clear more research is necessary to address safety and efficacy concerns regarding community water fluoridation,\u201d Ladapo said in the release.",
      "Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who tracks illnesses on her website, Your Local Epidemiologist, reacted to Ladapo\u2019s announcement Friday. \u201cReplacing community good for individualism is a slippery slope,\u201d she said.",
      "Ladapo has been previously criticized for going against basic public health measures. Pediatricians were enraged in February, for example, when Ladapo left the decision on whether to quarantine children amid a massive measles outbreak to parents. He has questioned the effectiveness of Covid vaccines and threatened criminal charges against TV stations in Florida that aired an ad supporting the state\u2019s abortion rights ballot measure until a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against him.",
      "He\u2019s rumored to be on a list of people who could play a major health role in the next administration. Robert F.

      "When residents of Buffalo, New York, realized in January 2023 that fluoride had been missing from their water supply since 2015 \u2014 uncovered by a local investigative reporter \u2014 demand to reinstate the cavity-fighting mineral to their drinking water was swift.",
      "Parents said their kids\u2019 teeth were full of cavities despite drinking and brushing regularly with what they thought for years was fluoridated water.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s many stories of young children who have ended up in (the) hospital needing emergency dental surgery,\u201d Robert Corp, a lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Buffalo parents, told NBC affiliate WGRZ.",
      "City leaders acted. Less than two years later, in late September, fluoride once again flowed from Buffalo taps.",
      "Other cities, such as Abilene, Kansas, and McVille, North Dakota, have done the same, according to the American Dental Association.",
      "\u2018Helping the most vulnerable\u2019",
      "According to the CDC, kids in lower-income families have nearly three times higher rates of untreated cavities compared to children in higher-income families.",
      "There are several reasons. Just 1 in 3 dentists in the U.S. treat Medicaid patients. And nearly half of U.S. kids do not receive regular dental care, according to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Adding fluoride to water systems \u201cmitigates the impact of disparities in access to dental care,\u201d said Jetelina, the epidemiologist. \u201cThis is one of the beauties of public health \u2014 a mainly invisible population intervention, helping the most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Still, the scrutiny continues.",
      "In September, a federal judge in California ruled that even though he couldn\u2019t conclude with certainty that fluoridated water was a danger to public health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should strengthen water fluoridation regulations.",
      "Another report stemming from that decision, looking specifically at kids\u2019 IQ levels, is expected early next year."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:50:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Attorneys for Daniel Penny, who is standing trial on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the May 2023 chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man on the New York City subway, rested their case Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for Daniel Penny, who\u00a0is standing trial on charges\u00a0of\u00a0manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the May 2023 chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man on the New York City subway, rested their case Friday.",
      "The jury is expected to hear closing arguments and start deliberations after Thanksgiving.",
      "If Penny is convicted of manslaughter, the more serious charge, he could face up to 15 years in prison.",
      "Neely, 30, a Michael Jackson impersonator with a history of mental illness, had been behaving erratically but not violently, prosecutors said, on an F train he and Penny were both on when Penny threw him to the ground and put him in a chokehold for six minutes. They said Penny\u2019s actions turned criminal when he kept choking Neely, even after he no longer posed a threat.",
      "Bystander video of the two men that was widely shared online placed a spotlight on race relations, public safety within the city\u2019s subway system and on how the city addresses mental health and homelessness. Penny is white. Neely was Black. Neely had a history of psychiatric and drug problems, and, on the day he was killed, he had synthetic cannabinoids in his system.",
      "Penny\u2019s attorneys say the former Marine acted to protect himself and fellow passengers. They said he did not intend to kill Neely and did not apply enough pressure to do so.",
      "Defense witness Dr. Satish Chundru, a forensic pathologist and consultant, testified Thursday that he did not believe Neely had died of a chokehold. Chundru said Neely died from \u201cthe combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\u201d that was in his system. He was one of the defense\u2019s two experts witnesses. Penny\u2019s attorneys also called six character witnesses, including his mother and sister.",
      "Chundru\u2019s testimony was intended to refute the findings of New York City medical examiner Dr. Cynthia Harris, who performed Neely\u2019s autopsy and ruled that Penny\u2019s chokehold had killed him. She was a prosecution witness and testified over three days.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my medical opinion that there are no alternative reasonable explanations for Mr. Neely\u2019s death,\u201d Harris told jurors a week ago.",
      "She also testified that \u201cthe consensus was unanimous\u201d within the medical examiner\u2019s office as to Neely\u2019s cause of death.",
      "Harris, who was in court Thursday and Friday during Chundru\u2019s testimony, was one of more than 30 witnesses called by prosecutors during the trial, including other passengers on the train the day Neely was killed.",
      "Much of the final day of witness testimony Friday was dedicated to Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran\u2019s cross-examination of Chundru. Yoran called attention to instances where, she said, Chundru\u2019s testimony contrasted with the findings of other medical professionals, including the American Society of Hematologists, and of his opinions in other cases.",
      "On Friday afternoon, prosecutors also called New York City Police Officer Stephon Joefield as a rebuttal witness, to refute earlier testimony from Chundru that\u00a0two people at the scene reported Neely was breathing after Penny let him go.",
      "Jurors were shown a police body-camera video of Neely laying on the ground when Joefield responded to the subway. Joefield could be heard saying Neely was breathing. Joefield testified that Neely was unconscious and unresponsive when he arrived. He said he checked Neely\u2019s pulse and that he had one, but that neither he nor his partner had checked whether Neely was breathing.",
      "\u201cI assumed that because he had a pulse that he was breathing,\u201d Joefield testified.",
      "Harris, the medical examiner, previously testified that a pulse can be maintained for about 10 minutes after the brain dies in cases of asphyxial death."

      "James Craig, who was charged and pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder last year in the killing of Angela Craig, is now also accused of first-degree solicitation to commit perjury, the state's 18th Judicial District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "An infant has died and 10 adults have been sickened amid a four-state listeria outbreak connected to ready-to-eat meat products, officials said.",
      "The outbreak has been tied to ready-to-eat meat produced by Yu Shang Food, Inc. of Spartanburg,\u00a0South Carolina, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an update Friday.",
      "Among those sickened, there was one person each in New York state and New Jersey, two in Illinois, and seven in California, including the child who died. All have identified themselves as having Asian heritage, the CDC said.",
      "The infant who died was a twin whose sibling also died but whose death could not be linked to listeria. Their pregnant mother was also sickened but recovered, the CDC said.",
      "\"Listeria was found in a sample from the mother and from one of the twin infants, but it could not be found in a sample from the other infant,\" the update stated.",
      "Another infant, apparently not related to the twins, became ill and also recovered, it said.",
      "Of the eight people sickened, seven shopped at markets where Yu Shang Food products are sold, and two said they recalled eating Yu Shang Food chicken, the CDC update said.",
      "Contaminated products were discovered during a routine inspection of the Yu Shang Food plant by U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors on Oct. 21, which led to a recall on Nov. 9 and an expanded recall on Thursday, according to a USDA statement.",
      "Inspectors ultimately found Listeria monocytogenes on meat products produced at the plant, the USDA said.",
      "The CDC said its investigators determined a genetic footprint for listeria in the outbreak and determined it was similar for all cases. \u201cThis suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food,\u201d the CDC said in its update.",
      "The recall covers nearly two dozen varieties of prepared meat that include \u201cBraised Pork Belly In Brown Sauce,\u201d \u201cSeasoned Chicken Quarter Leg,\u201d and \u201cBraised Beef Shank,\u201d according to the USDA.",
      "The recalled products were produced before Oct. 28 and marked inside USDA inspection hallmarks as \u201cP-46684\u201d or \u201cEST. M46684.\u201d",
      "The products are sold by at least four retailers, including 99 Ranch Market.",
      "Anyone with the recalled products was urged to discard them, the USDA said. Freezers and refrigerators that contained the product should be carefully cleaned, the CDC said.",
      "Exposure to listeria can cause life-threatening illness for older adults, those with weakened immunity systems, pregnant women, and newborns, the USDA said.",
      "Listeria infection is the third-ranked cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States, the CDC said.",
      "Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions and diarrhea, the CDC said. For pregnant women it can infect newborns, it said, and for the elderly it can cause fatal infections."

    "story": [
      "A decision on whether Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' will be released on bail was pushed back to next week by the judge overseeing his sex-trafficking case.",
      "During a hearing Friday in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Aran Subramanian asked Combs' attorneys and prosecutors to file paperwork by Monday outlining specific terms of his release.",
      "Combs, who appeared thin, waved and blew kisses to his mother and children seated in the second row of the gallery.",
      "Prosecutor Christy Slavik argued in the hearing that it would be dangerous to grant the music mogul's request.",
      "\u201cHe is paying his way out of custody and continues to flout the rules, he is a risk of flight, a danger to the community, he\u2019s obstructing and trying to subvert the integrity of these proceedings,\" Slavik said.",
      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said that if Combs were released, he would stay in a three-bedroom apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. He would be guarded by Patriot Security, a private company, and would be allowed to call only his attorneys. Only counsel and family members could visit.",
      "Subramanian said he was concerned about family or security, paid for by Combs, reaching out to victims or witnesses on his behalf and wanted more clarification on how Combs would communicate and what means of communications he would be allowed to use.",
      "Combs, 55, who is being held at\u00a0Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center as he awaits his trial scheduled for May 5, has pleaded not guilty. He is charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Agnifilo argued in court that his client should be released on bail because other high-profile defendants with similar charges, like former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries, who was charged last month by New York prosecutors with sex trafficking, have been granted it.",
      "But prosecutors argued that Combs has been witness tampering from behind bars.",
      "In a recent filing, prosecutors said Combs has continued to try to \"evade law enforcement monitoring, corruptly influence witness testimony, and further attack the integrity of these proceedings.\"",
      "Combs' bail hearing comes two days after Subramanian ordered prosecutors to get rid of 19 pages of notes taken from his jail cell in a recent sweep because it was protected under attorney-client privilege.",
      "Scrutiny of Combs began last year when his former romantic partner\u00a0Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, filed a lawsuit\u00a0alleging Combs raped and beat her in fits of \u201cuncontrollable rage\u201d and exerted a \u201ctight hold over her life.\u201d",
      "The suit also alleged that he forced her to engage in sexual acts he called \u201cfreak offs\u201d with other men while he watched. The other men were often sex workers whom he\u2019d pay to travel with them, the suit said.",
      "Ventura settled with Combs a day after the lawsuit became public, and Combs denied all the allegations. But surveillance video surfaced that\u00a0showed Combs beating Cassie in a hotel hallway\u00a0in 2016."

      "It took Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, just a few weeks to make his mark on the Senate \u2014 even before he'd actually take the oath of office to replace retiring Sen. Mitt Romney next year.",
      "As Senate colleagues and those close to President-elect Donald Trump saw it, Curtis, a senator-elect, was among the group of at least five Republicans who were planning to vote against former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s nomination to lead the Justice Department.",
      "The opposition was enough to sink Gaetz, who withdrew from contention Thursday afternoon \u2014 an episode demonstrating to Trump and his allies that red lines still remain in a Republican Party that\u2019s largely bent to his will. It also highlighted Curtis\u2019 role to play in coloring in those lines, as an early indicator of how the Utahn is approaching his new office and a glimpse at the kind of influence he could wield once there.",
      "Those who know Curtis caution not to look at his role in Gaetz\u2019s withdrawal too simplistically, through the \u201cpro-Trump\u201d or \u201canti-Trump\u201d litmus test that\u2019s defined much of Republican politics over the last eight years. Instead, they point to the test Curtis laid out himself during a June primary debate: \u201cWhen President Trump is doing anything that I consider aligned with Utah values \u2026 I\u2019m wind at his back. But I\u2019m not going to give him an unconditional yes to anything that he wants.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is not Mitt Romney and he is not Donald Trump. He\u2019s got his own brand and he was very clear about that in his primary and his general election,\u201d said former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, an NBC News contributor who overlapped with Curtis in the House. Romney, notably, was the lone Republican who voted to convict Trump at his first Senate impeachment trial in 2020, and he was a vocal critic of Trump on numerous other occasions during the last eight years, six of which Romney spent in the Senate.",
      "\u201cWith this Gaetz episode, you will see him stand up for what he thinks is right,\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cAnd other times he\u2019s going to be another reliable Republican vote in the Senate.\u201d",
      "Born in Salt Lake City, the 64-year-old Curtis met his wife in high school, graduated from Brigham Young University and served his Mormon mission in Taiwan. He and his wife have six children and 17 grandchildren, with number 18 on the way. After more than a decade of corporate work, Curtis became the chief operating officer of Action Target, a company that manufactures shooting ranges and targets. He briefly served in local Democratic Party leadership and was elected to two terms as mayor of Provo, where he began his now-famous collection of hundreds of pairs of \u201cfun\u201d socks that serve as conversation starters and icebreakers with his constituents.",
      "Curtis joined Congress in 2017 in a special election to replace former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who had earned a reputation as a partisan warrior as the head of the House Oversight Committee that investigated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ahead of and during her 2016 presidential bid. As the popular mayor of the largest city in the congressional district, Curtis emerged victorious in a crowded Republican primary field after repelling attacks from his right flank, in part criticizing his decision not to vote for Trump in the 2016 election.",
      "In his victory speech that year, Curtis argued that Congress needed \u201cbridge builders, not bomb throwers,\u201d adding that \u201cif you\u2019re not white, Mormon or male, I am still here for you.\u201d His allies say that\u2019s the kind of message he took to Washington with him as a congressman.",
      "Former Utah Republican Gov. Gary Herbert told NBC News that his relationship with the senator-elect goes back to Herbert\u2019s days on the Utah County Commission, when Curtis chaired the local Democratic Party. Herbert called Curtis a \u201cgood, decent person\u201d who is easy to like. And he said he decided to endorse Curtis\u2019 congressional bid because he believed him to be the \u201cright kind of person\u201d to come to Washington.",
      "Curtis was \u201ca person who was really wanting to get things done, not just to be on cable news and get headlines that way, throwing out red meat to the faithful, but actually trying to work with all people, including the other side of the aisle, to get things done,\u201d Herbert said.",
      "\u201cAnd as a congressman, he proved that to be his modus operandi, and he was very capable,\u201d Herbert added, pointing to Curtis\u2019 legislative record.",
      "Curtis himself has leaned on that legislative record, touting success on bills he got enacted on issues like energy, conservation and protecting Taiwan. As he ran for Senate, he\u2019s touted outside analysis referring to him as one of the more effective members of Congress.",
      "Curbelo pointed to Curtis\u2019 decision to launch a Republican-only climate caucus as an example of how the Utahn was able to get dozens of conservative lawmakers to the table on an issue not always associated with the GOP.",
      "\u201cWhen John decided how he was going to get involved on the issue, he said, \u2018No, let\u2019s have a caucus that\u2019s only for Republicans, because Republicans need to learn more about this issue and grow on the issue before they can even think about engaging Democrats,\u2019\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cThat was a very realistic and mature way of thinking about the issue, and it\u2019s been a success.\u201d",
      "His allies note conservative positions on issues like immigration and debt. But like most Republicans in the Trump era, the former and future president has been one of the issues looming largest during his career in Washington.",
      "Curtis has praised Trump on issues like tax reform, \u201cderegulation\u201d and his Supreme Court nominations, and he voted against both of the House\u2019s impeachment attempts. But he didn\u2019t join the majority of his GOP House colleagues in their support for a Texas lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election, he voted to establish a bipartisan committee to investigate the 2021 attack on the Capitol and he supported censuring Trump after the Capitol riot.",
      "It\u2019s opened Curtis up to scrutiny, again, from the more conservative wing of his party. After deciding to run for Senate after Romney\u2019s retirement announcement, Trump weighed in and endorsed Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs.",
      "Framing himself as a \u201cproven conservative\u201d with help from well-funded outside groups, Curtis won the Republican Senate primary decisively, earning just shy of 50% support in a crowded primary that also included the former state House speaker and a wealthy businessman.",
      "His Senate campaign victory speech harkened back to the one he delivered after winning his first House election, including an emphasis on representing \u201cevery Utahn,\u201d and a promise not to be \u201cthrowing gas on the social media fire or giving click bait to the cable news.\u201d Instead, Curtis said, he\u2019d be \u201criding my Ford up and down, back and forth across this state, doing the hard work of legislating and getting things done.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not sure where to find me, don\u2019t look by the cameras or the microphones. I\u2019ll be on the Senate floor with my colleagues from both parties,\u201d he added, trying to \u201csolve our difficult problems.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s where Curtis found himself as Gaetz began meeting with Republican senators. Curtis didn\u2019t take to social media or run to the microphones to make clear where he stood. But his colleagues and Trump allies felt that they understood his perspective, with Curtis\u2019 likely disapproval of Gaetz leading to his quick withdrawal.",
      "Herbert, the former governor, said he exchanged text messages with Curtis in which the senator-elect acknowledged the \u201cchallenge\u201d ahead of him with some of Trump\u2019s nominees, and the \u201cimportant role that the Senate plays under the Constitution of advise and consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, Rep. Gaetz came up in the conversation too as somebody who appears to be \u2014 we need to have close scrutiny whether he fits the mold of what we want to have as a leader in the [attorney general\u2019s] office,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cI think I knew at the time of our discussion how he\u2019d come down.\u201d",
      "Herbert said the situation is emblematic of the kind of lawmaker Curtis is: supporting Trump when he believes the president-elect is right but willing to disagree, when needed, with \u201cmutual respect and dignity and grace.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to call people names, and he recognizes that his own constituency here in Utah, that\u2019s what they want and expect out of their elected officials,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cNot only has he been popular, he\u2019s going to continue to be popular as a senator, because the people of Utah want somebody with moral values, moral fiber, integrity and respect for opposition, [who tries] to find ways to get things done as opposed to a way to blow things up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe recognizes the legacy of what\u2019s gone before him, but he will create the John Curtis legacy for those who come after him,\u201d Herbert continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s yet to be written, but I expect it will be a very positive story.\u201d"

    "summary": "A prominent digital rights activist, who is transgender, confronted Rep. Nancy Mace at a public event Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "A prominent digital rights activist, who is transgender, confronted Rep. Nancy Mace at a public event Thursday, days after the congresswoman from South Carolina introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from using women\u2019s bathrooms in the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Evan Greer, the director of Fight for the Future, stood up during the kickoff panel at \u201cThe Summit of the Future of the Internet\u201d at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C., and displayed an LGBTQ pride flag. Mace was speaking alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and radio host Charlamagne tha God on the topic \u201cBipartisan Tech Solutions to Unite a Nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have had dozens of trans people die this year because of the hate and lies that you are spreading,\u201d Greer said, to applause from the audience, as she was escorted out of the room. \u201cAre we building an internet with free speech for everyone or just the privileged few?\u201d",
      "Mace responded by misgendering Greer and making a comment about her genitals, which the crowd booed at. A representative for Mace and Project Liberty, the organization that hosted the summit and invited Greer, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Greer\u2019s organization is known for its viral protest efforts against internet censorship and surveillance and in support of net neutrality.",
      "Videos of Greer at the event have been viewed more than 1 million times on X, where conservative influencers and Mace have continued to misgender and insult Greer.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Greer said that Project Liberty has yet to reach out to her or make any statements about the panel, her protest or Mace\u2019s remarks. While Greer said she had hoped that other people, including cisgender people (who identify with their gender assigned at birth), would have joined her in opposing Mace\u2019s presence in the panel, she said, \u201cIn the end, I was there in the room and I just could not sit silently.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal is to call to the progressive tech policy community and ask ourselves, what is our strategy going into these next four years?\u201d Greer said. \u201cAre we going to try and curry favor with people whose goals are diametrically opposed to human rights, or are we going to draw some lines in the sand and build a meaningful strategy for collective resistance to the role that technology will play in carrying out human rights violations?\u201d",
      "Greer said, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to convince her of anything, but really my goal was to spark a conversation within the tech policy space, to ask ourselves, \u2018What are we actually fighting for?\u2019\u201d",
      "After taking office in 2021, Mace initially said she was pro-LGBTQ rights. But in recent days, she has made headlines and racked up engagement on social media by leading an anti-transgender campaign against the only trans member of Congress, Sarah McBride, one that has received the support of House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "McBride, whom Mace has repeatedly misgendered, said in a statement that she would follow the new bathroom rules as outlined by Johnson, even if she disagrees with them. In her congressional office, McBride will have a private bathroom, while all other public bathrooms in the Capitol will be banned for transgender people."

    "summary": "The judge presiding over Donald Trump's New York hush money trial on Friday postponed the sentencing that was scheduled for next week to allow for more time for arguments on whether the case should be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "The judge presiding over Donald Trump's New York hush money trial on Friday postponed the sentencing that was scheduled for next week to allow for more time for arguments on whether the case should be dismissed.",
      "State Judge\u00a0Juan Merchan\u00a0ruled after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said in a court filing\u00a0this week that it wouldn\u2019t oppose a motion by Trump's attorneys to delay his sentencing on\u00a034 felony counts of falsifying business records.",
      "In a brief order, Merchan set new deadlines in early December for Trump's lawyers and prosecutors to make their arguments about whether the case should be dismissed in light of his being elected president. The defense must file by Dec. 2 and the prosecution has until Dec. 9 to respond.",
      "Merchan also delayed deciding on another pending question about whether the verdict should be set aside because of the Supreme Court's decision regarding presidential immunity. He was originally scheduled to decide on those motions by Nov. 19.",
      "He did not schedule a new date for sentencing. Trump is scheduled to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump spokesman Steven Cheung called the ruling \"a decisive win\" for the president-elect and criticized the case as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax.\"",
      "Trump had been scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but his attorneys argued that the sentencing hearing \u2014 and the entire case \u2014 should be \"immediately dismissed\" because of presidential immunity protections, which they contend are already in place as a result of his \"overwhelming victory\" on Election Day.",
      "\u201cJust as a sitting President is completely immune from any criminal process, so too is President Trump as President-elect,\u201d Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued in a filing Wednesday.",
      "They've also argued he can't be sentenced after his term in office because that's too long to wait.",
      "Trump last week said he plans to nominate Blanche and Bove for high-ranking posts at the Justice Department in his new administration.",
      "Prosecutors in Manhattan said they would challenge Trump\u2019s efforts to dismiss the hush money case but acknowledged that his sentencing might need to take place after he leaves office.",
      "\u201cThe People deeply respect the Office of the President, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that Defendant\u2019s inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,\" their filing said.",
      "\u201cGiven the need to balance competing constitutional interests, consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of Defendant\u2019s upcoming presidential term,\u201d prosecutors added.",
      "Trump was convicted\u00a0on all counts in May after a weekslong trial at which he was accused of having falsified business records to cover up his reimbursement of hush money his then-lawyer Michael Cohen paid to adult film star\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u00a0in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "Daniels claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, an allegation he has denied.",
      "Trump was first scheduled to be sentenced in July, but the proceeding was put off in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that month that expanded presidential immunity protections in a federal case against Trump. After that ruling, his attorneys said the New York conviction and its underlying indictment should be dismissed, arguing that the Supreme Court's decision means prosecutors shouldn\u2019t have been permitted to use some of the trial evidence against him.",
      "The Manhattan jury verdict marked the\u00a0first time\u00a0a former U.S. president had ever been convicted of a crime. The case was the only one of four criminal cases brought against Trump after he left office in 2021 to go to trial.",
      "The two federal cases are winding down as a result of his Election Day win, and a state case in Georgia has been moving slowly as Trump and some of his co-defendants have sought to have the prosecutor disqualified. Their appeal was set to be argued in December, but the appeals court abruptly canceled that hearing this week."

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 12:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "This year has seen some of the worst sales in decades for the art market, and the \u201cComedian\u201d piece is unlikely to move the needle one way or the other.",
    "story": [
      "For most art-world buyers, a work unsubtly called \u201cComedian\u201d lacked a certain a-peel.",
      "It\u2019s little wonder: \u201cComedian\u201d is actually just a banana duct-taped to a wall. Created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, the piece debuted at the 2019 Art Basel fair in Miami, where it caused a sensation but also earned as many chuckles as critical plaudits.",
      "But on Wednesday, Cattelan got the last laugh as \u201cComedian\u201d sold for $6.24 million, including $1 million in fees.",
      "The buyer was soon revealed to be Justin Sun, a 34-year old cryptocurrency platform founder from China and based in Switzerland. Sun confirmed the purchase on his X feed, writing that it represented \u201ca cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe this piece will inspire more thought and discussion in the future and will become a part of history,\u201d Sun wrote, adding he would personally eat the banana \u201cas part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture.\u201d",
      "A Sotheby\u2019s executive, meanwhile, hailed the purchase as emblematic of someone seeking to address art\u2019s biggest questions.",
      "\u201cHow do you value what, for me at least, is one of the most brilliant ideas in the history of conceptual art,\u201d David Galperin, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art for the Americas, said in a release. \u201cAnd what better place to ask that question than in our salesroom, where tonight the answer came in at a resounding\u00a0$6.2 million.\u201d",
      "Yet in much of the broader art world, Sun\u2019s winning bid was met with a shrug. Continuing a recent trend, 2024\u00a0has seen some of the worst sales in decades, and the purchase of \u201cComedian\u201d is unlikely to move the needle one way or the other, said Alex Glauber, founder of AWG Art Advisory and president of the Association of Professional Art Advisors.",
      "\u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u2019s an indication of anything,\u201d Glauber said of the \u201cComedian\u201d sale. He compared it to the purchase in 2017 of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvatore Mundi\u201d for a then-record $450 million, which occurred at a time when the demand for \u201cold masters,\u201d or classic, traditional artworks, was waning in favor of contemporary works.",
      "Likewise, \u201cComedian\u201d is being considered something of a one-off, Glauber said. While $6.24 million might seem like an eye-watering price for such a work, its very absurdity goes hand-in-hand with the nature of the piece and does not necessarily speak to wider purchasing trends.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about holding a mirror up to the art market, while channeling a legacy of conceptual art going back to Duchamp,\u201d Glauber said, referring to artist Marcel Duchamp, whose submission of a urinal he dubbed \u201cFountain\u201d to an art exhibition in 1917 is considered a foundational moment in conceptual art.",
      "\u201cSo in a way this work is self-reflexive \u2014\u00a0and the more it sold for, the more it proved its own concept.\u201d",
      "The rest of Sotheby\u2019s Wednesday auction is arguably more indicative of the art market\u2019s doldrums: Sotheby\u2019s \u201cNow\u201d portion of the evening, which showcases art produced in the last 20 years, saw\u00a0$16.5 million in total sales, beating estimates but coming in far below the $72.9 million seen for the equivalent \u201cNow\u201d auction in 2022, according to The New York Times.",
      "In a recent paper, Jianping Mei and Michael Moses of JP Mei & MA Moses Art Market Consultancy found that the average return on art sold in the first of half 2024 was just 0.1%, the lowest yield since 2000 \u2014 with half the works selling at a loss.",
      "\u201cHow bad is it? It\u2019s as bad as it gets,\u201d Moses told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult period for the art market.\u201d",
      "One big reason is simply that other investments, like stocks and gold, have seen far greater returns this century, Moses said.",
      "And while some who have capitalized on those assets will inevitably purchase art, artworks themselves have their own rates of return that depend more on evolutions in taste that don\u2019t correlate with wider macroeconomic trends.",
      "What \u201cComedian\u201d may signal instead is an expansion of the kinds of goods that cryptocurrencies can buy, as those financial instruments continue to witness stunning price increases. This year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled, and is now approaching $100,000.",
      "Sun, the \u201cComedian\u201d buyer, used his own cryptocurrency, TRX, to make the purchase, Sotheby\u2019s said. According to CoinMarketCap, the market value of all outstanding TRX coins as the sale occurred equated to more than $12 billion, with Sun himself boasting a net worth of $1.5 billion.",
      "According to the Robb Report, cryptocurrency use in high-end purchases for everything from real estate to yachts to jewelry has increased in turn.",
      "Yet even those purchases may not represent the norm. Robert Allen, a South Florida-based attorney who specializes in yacht deals, said people who are newly wealthy from cryptocurrency price increases appear to be prioritizing financial goals that were once previously attainable but which several years of soaring consumer prices and high interest rates have made more difficult.",
      "\u201cInflation has taken the American dream away from millennials and younger generations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for a certain sector that has invested in crypto, when it makes a hit, they\u2019re making down payments on houses, maybe taking a trip to Europe or around South America. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be an explosion in high-end luxury yet.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Reproductive rights groups are preparing for legal battles in several of the states where voters approved constitutional amendments to protect or expand abortion access.",
    "story": [
      "Reproductive rights groups are preparing for legal battles in several of the states where voters approved constitutional amendments to protect or expand abortion access this month.",
      "After seven of the 10 pro-abortion rights measures on the November ballot across the country passed, the groups that backed them are now working to ensure they are implemented smoothly, particularly in states where the amendments will undo existing abortion bans.",
      "Abortion rights groups are bracing for an especially tough fight in conservative Missouri, where they see one of the most restrictive bans in the country in place. Missouri banned almost all abortions after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with exceptions to protect the life of the mother and for medical emergencies.",
      "The newly passed Amendment 3 protects abortion rights up to fetal viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy, with exceptions afterward to protect the life or health of the woman, which would mark the biggest change in the law of any state that voted on the issue this year.",
      "Under Missouri law, the measure becomes formally enshrined in the state constitution 30 days after passage. But reproductive groups say even that doesn\u2019t present the kind of legal security desired by abortion clinics to resume services.",
      "That fearful posture has a couple main causes: Missouri is the first state with a near-total abortion ban to approve a constitutional amendment making abortion a fundamental right, and the GOP-led Legislature has long been hostile to abortion rights.",
      "\u201cMissouri is the one where the obstacles are going to be greatest,\u201d said Olivia Cappello, who helps run state advocacy operations for Planned Parenthood\u2019s national political arm. \u201cThe decades of restrictions and cuts to public funding for reproductive health care services, as well as the general hostility of the state government, has pushed a lot of abortion providers out of that state. So it\u2019s going to take a while to revamp the care infrastructure there.\u201d",
      "Anti-abortion groups and Republican lawmakers in Missouri challenged the measure\u2019s appearance on the ballot at every turn. As a result, despite the ballot measure\u2019s passage, there is no expectation that lawmakers will swiftly make changes to state statutes regarding abortion access.",
      "\u201cGoing to the courts is our fastest option, and also our most likely option to work in Missouri,\u201d she said.",
      "The ACLU of Missouri, together with a coalition of reproductive rights groups, has already filed litigation seeking to block the dozens of abortion restrictions on the books in the state \u2014 including the near-total ban \u2014 as part an effort to force implementation of the passed amendment.",
      "\u201cMissourians overwhelmingly voted to end Missouri\u2019s abortion ban and protect reproductive freedom. Our lawsuit is the next step to fulfill the promise of the amendment,\u201d Tori Schafer, the deputy director for policy and campaigns at the ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.",
      "The suit specifically asks the Missouri Supreme Court to declare the state\u2019s abortion ban unconstitutional and seeks the legal authorization for abortion providers in the state to resume services immediately. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 4, one day before the amendment would formally take effect.",
      "Several anti-abortion groups, including Missouri Stands with Women and the Thomas More Society, have indicated they\u2019ll fight implementation but haven\u2019t offered specific plans.",
      "Kelsey Pritchard, the director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America,\u00a0a national anti-abortion group that worked against the passage of amendments in Missouri and elsewhere, said in an email that the measure\u2019s \u201cslim margin of victory\u201d amounted to a \u201cclear indication that there will be pro-life victories in Missouri\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "Pritchard didn\u2019t provide any specifics about how the group might fight implementation of the measure in the state.",
      "Similar efforts appear imminent in Arizona, where passage of Proposition 139 created a \u201cfundamental right\u201d in the state\u2019s constitution to receive an abortion up until fetal viability,\u00a0with exceptions after that if a health care professional decides it\u2019s needed to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual.\u201d",
      "Officials will formally certify all statewide elections results Monday, opening the door for prospective litigation around its implementation.",
      "The passage of the ballot measure effectively undoes Arizona\u2019s current abortion law \u2014 which states that abortions are legal up until the 15th week of pregnancy, with an exception after that to save the woman\u2019s life but no exceptions for rape or incest \u2014 and contradicts what abortion rights groups say are approximately 40 other restrictions on care in state law.",
      "For the measure to be effectively carried out, these groups plan to quickly follow the Monday certification deadline with litigation they say is designed to prompt judges to overturn the dozens of existing abortion restrictions on the books in the state. They expect the process to take months.",
      "\u201cThe 40-plus laws that are still on the books don\u2019t automatically disappear,\u201d said Chris Love, a senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. \u201cThere will need to be legal challenges to most or all of those 40 laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Beyond the 15-week ban, the future of many of these abortion restrictions in the state may remain in question, despite the measure\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cThere are others where, potentially, an Arizona judge, likely appointed by one of our many Republican governors over the decades, would see it differently,\u201d said Dawn Penich, a spokesperson for the ballot measure campaign. She cited a 24-hour waiting period required for women to receive abortion care in the state as an example of the kind of law that may be allowed to stand.",
      "Despite the amendment\u2019s passage, securing access to abortion through fetal viability \u201cis not going to be easy and definitely not quick,\u201d she said.",
      "Anti-abortion groups haven\u2019t yet filed any litigation seeking to hamper forward movement of the measure\u2019s implementation in Arizona. At least one prominent anti-abortion organization has vowed to fight its implementation.",
      "\u201cWe hope to bring more alongside us in the next few weeks and months to continue this battle for life.\u00a0This fight is not over,\u201d Arizona Right to Life Chair Jill Norgaard said in a statement. Her group called on \u201cits allies in the fight against Proposition 139 to work together to overturn\u201d it in a statement this week.",
      "Pritchard, of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which also worked against passage of the measure in Arizona, didn\u2019t respond to questions about the group\u2019s future involvement around implementation in the state.",
      "Meanwhile, no litigation on either side of the issue has yet emerged in Montana, where voters passed a ballot measure enshrining abortion in the state constitution. But abortion rights groups in the heavily Republican state said they\u2019re prepared to respond to any.",
      "In Montana, abortion is already legal until fetal viability, meaning there is no need for a complicated legal process to unwind any major restrictions. That has meant that abortion rights groups haven\u2019t needed to file any affirmative litigation, and it significantly lowers the possibility of any viable challenges to the measure\u2019s implementation.",
      "Abortion rights groups also aren\u2019t expecting much of a battle in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada or New York \u2014 the remaining four states where voters passed measures enshrining abortion rights in state constitutions earlier this month.",
      "In Nevada, that\u2019s because voters will have to pass the same measure once again in 2026 for it to take effect (under state law, such amendments must pass in two consecutive election cycles).",
      "In Maryland and New York, abortions are already legal through fetal viability, while Colorado has no laws restricting abortion and no gestational limits for women seeking abortions. The constitutional amendments in these blue states serve almost entirely to prevent lawmakers from undoing existing protections in the future.",
      "Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota rejected proposed amendments that would have enshrined abortion protections in their state constitutions, the first states where pro-abortion-rights ballot measures failed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe.",
      "Reproductive rights groups said those outcomes make it clear that there remains significant opposition to abortion rights in many pockets across the country, and that they can\u2019t take anything for granted \u2014 including in states where such measures passed.",
      "\u201cBallot measures don\u2019t end on Election Day. Ballot measure coalitions have to stay engaged long after to ensure that the policies that they passed are implemented within the spirit that they are intended,\u201d said Quentin Savwoir, the director of programs and strategy at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works with progressive organizations to help advance citizen-led ballot measures.",
      "Savwoir added that his group expected to see an increase in actions and legislation that would make it harder for other states to put the future of abortion rights directly in the hands of voters.",
      "He predicted, for example, the emergence of bills in GOP-led states that mirror a Florida law that requires 60% support from voters to pass any such citizen-led ballot initiative. (The ballot measure that would have enshrined abortion rights in Florida\u2019s constitution failed, even though it received the support of 57% of voters.)",
      "\u201cWe are preparing for an escalation of all types of attacks on the ballot measure and initiative process itself, given the overwhelming support of our initiatives,\u201d he said."

    "title": "Cold plunge or a hot bath? New study suggests which has more benefits for athletes",
    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "A new small study suggests that athletes will perform better if they soak in a hot tub rather than a frigid one, especially if there are breaks in their workouts.",
    "story": [
      "Ice baths after exercise are hot, especially among influencers.",
      "But a new small study suggests that recreational athletes perform better if they soak in a hot tub rather than a frigid one, especially if there are breaks in their workouts, such as halftime in football and soccer, according to a report presented Thursday at the 2024 Integrative Physiology of Exercise Conference in University Park, Pennsylvania.",
      "When you exercise vigorously, muscle fibers are damaged and the hot water can increase blood flow, which helps the muscles repair themselves and become stronger, said the study\u2019s lead author, Mamoru Tsuyuki, a master\u2019s student in sports and health science at Ritsumeikan University in Shiga, Japan.",
      "\u201cAlso increasing muscle temperature is going to help improve power output,\u201d Tsuyuki told NBC News in a Zoom call. \u201cWhen you need to perform twice in the same day, such as in sports that have a halftime, heat is better. During the 15 or 20 minutes, if you can immerse yourself in hot water, you can probably perform better in the second half.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no value in icy soaks, Tsuyuki said, adding that other studies have shown that the frigid water can relieve muscle soreness. Moreover, ice is best if there is an injury.",
      "Tsuyuki said he\u2019d like to see more research comparing the benefits and disadvantages of both temperature soaks.",
      "\u201cWe used endurance running, but the results might be different with other types of exercise,\u201d he added.",
      "Why is a hot soak better?",
      "To take a closer look at the impact of hot and icy soaks, Tsuyuki and his colleagues rounded up 10 young men to perform in a three-part study.",
      "The men performed 50 minutes of high-intensity interval running and then soaked for 20 minutes in a 59-degree tub; a 104-degree tub; or sat without immersing themselves in water.",
      "All 10 men experienced all three conditions during the study.",
      "One hour after the initial workout, the study volunteers were asked to jump as high as they could from standing and squatting positions. The height the men attained when jumping was lower after a cold soak than a hot one.",
      "There was no difference in muscle soreness whether the men soaked in cold or hot water.",
      "\u201cIce baths are super trendy,\u201d said Aimee Layton, an associate professor of applied physiology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. And \u201cwhen you have an injury with heat and inflammation, the cold feels good. If you sprain an ankle, you want to put ice on it.\u201d",
      "But if you are not injured and just had a hard workout, cold can be detrimental, Layton said. \u201cIt constricts blood vessels and can cause the muscles to tighten,\u201d she added.",
      "When you work out vigorously, you get micro-tears in the muscles, Layton said. \u201cIt\u2019s what tells your body you need more muscle in the area to make it stronger for the next time,\u201d she said. \u201cHot water can increase circulation and may promote the recovery process.\u201d",
      "The temperature question can be complicated, said Dr. Spencer Stein, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine who specializes in sports medicine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw out cold baths,\u201d Stein said. \u201cThere are studies that show cold baths can decrease soreness.\u201d",
      "Still, \u201cmy experience with pro teams is they like warm baths before games,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a halftime, they don\u2019t do a cold plunge.\u201d",
      "Which temperature of water works best for an athlete depends on a number of factors, said David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. Both can have an impact on blood flow to the muscles.",
      "Hot water improves blood flow, which can carry away waste products associated with exercise, Putrino said. Cold, on the other hand, can improve blood flow in some athletes by activating the fight-or-flight response.",
      "And that\u2019s where the nuance enters.",
      "\u201cIf an athlete hates to be dumped into an ice bath and clenches up and starts shivering, you get the opposite effect,\u201d Putrino said. \u201cSomeone who really doesn\u2019t mind the cold at all can relax into an ice bath.\u201d",
      "There are people who love to do the cold plunges because they feel energized when they get out of the water, Putrino said. \u201cOnce they get out, their body is flooded with endorphins, the feel-good chemicals, and they get an immense rush of energy,\u201d he explained.",
      "\u201cMy recommendation is to use your own data to understand what works for you,\u201d Putrino said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe what you\u2019re hearing on podcasts.\u201d",
      "For a hot water soak, Putrino suggests:",
      "10 to 20 minutes at 98 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "10 to 20 minutes at 98 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "The optimal amount of time for ice water immersion is:",
      "10 to 15 minutes at temperatures ranging from 50 to 59 degrees.",
      "10 to 15 minutes at temperatures ranging from 50 to 59 degrees.",
      "For people trying a cold soak for the first time, 5 minutes can be beneficial.",
      "Whether you\u2019re a fan of cold or hot, experiment and keep track of which temperature soak helps you recover the quickest, Putrino said."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:06:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The movie \"Gladiator II\" features scenes involving rhinos, baboons and sharks. A professor explains whether these animals were actually featured in the Roman Colosseum.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "The image of a gladiator standing tall on top of a charging rhino flying through the Roman Colosseum became one of the shining moments of the \u201cGladiator II\u201d trailer \u2014 but the idea actually took more than two decades to complete.",
      "Director Ridley Scott first came up with the idea to stage a man-versus-rhino fight for the original \u201cGladiator\u201d film in 2000, but it was too dangerous to film with a real rhinoceros and too expensive to do with CGI, according to the \u201cGladiator II\u201d press notes.",
      "It was when the film\u2019s special effects supervisor Neil Corbould found old storyboards of the rhino fight that he and Scott decided to make the scene a reality for the sequel, which premiered in theaters on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cWhen I sat down with Ridley to talk about this film I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got something to show you,\u2019 and pulled them out. And he said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it this time,\u2019\u201d Corbould recalled in the press notes.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d producer Douglas Wick said the team learned \u201ca lot from the showmen of the ancient arena\u201d when they researched the first film.",
      "\u201cAs we contemplated a sequel, we reached back 2,000 years for guidance on how to top ourselves,\u201d Wick said, according to the press notes. \u201cThey had great answers. Enter the rhino.\u201d",
      "But is a gladiator facing a charging rhino something that could have actually happened in the Roman Colosseum? What about fending off a pack of ferocious, starved baboons, like Lucius, played by Paul Mescal, does while he's handcuffed?",
      "Lauren D. Ginsberg, associate professor of classical studies and theater studies at Duke University, gives TODAY.com an inside look into the historical accuracy of the three gladiator battles in the film featuring some seemingly absurd animals.",
      "\u201cThe goal, of course, was to have the strangest animals you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ginsberg says of the spectacles inside of the Colosseum. \u201cAnd that can mean animals no one has ever seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea was, especially for the Colosseum, the emperor can bring the whole Roman world to you,\u201d Ginsberg, who was not involved in the film, continues. \u201cAnd also every emperor has to do something flashier and more exciting and more innovative than the previous person.\u201d",
      "So, enter the rhino. And baboons. But sharks? Surprisingly, only one of these animals was completely out of the question in the Roman Empire, Ginsberg says.",
      "Could gladiators fight rhinos?",
      "While rhinos could appear in Roman arenas, gladiators weren't actually fighting them, Ginsberg says. Other animals could be brought in to fight each other, or professionally trained athletes could hunt the animals, she explains.",
      "But rhinos were a fan favorite among the Romans long before the Colosseum was even built.",
      "\u201cI think Julius Caesar was the first person that ever exhibited one, so even way before the Colosseum, because the Colosseum was built by the Flavian dynasty in the first century,\u201d Ginsberg says. \u201cRhinoceroses had been staples, but they weren\u2019t so common as to become boring. People were always still really excited when there was a rhinoceros.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg thinks rhinos were so popular for two main reasons.",
      "\u201cThey look interesting, but also because they\u2019re really angry creatures, or at least the way they were treated made them very angry in the arena, so they were often unpredictable, which was exciting,\u201d she says.",
      "While rhinos were a big hit at the Colosseum and other Roman arenas, Ginsberg does say there is no evidence to support a gladiator would have ever ridden one, like in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one was riding these wild animals. And part of that is that these were highly trained, very valuable athletes, so you don\u2019t actually want to put them in harm\u2019s way,\u201d she explains.",
      "What about baboons?",
      "In Lucius\u2019 first encounter with animals in the Colosseum, he\u2019s handcuffed along with several other prisoners and tasked with fighting off a slew of ravenous baboons.",
      "Wick, the film\u2019s producer, explained that many of the scenes in the movie came directly from Scott\u2019s mind.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be in a meeting discussing some story problem when Ridley would divine a solution. He thinks visually. We were pondering how to dramatize Lucius\u2019 anger as his superpower in the arena,\u201d Wick said, according to the press notes. \u201cRidley started to sketch Lucius in mortal battle with a ferocious baboon.\u201d",
      "In fact, Scott said he came up with the idea for the scene based on a real-life video of a baboon attack on a group of tourists in a parking lot in South Africa, according to the film's press notes.",
      "In the film, Lucius is not only able to fend off the baboons, but he eventually sinks his own teeth into one of the animals\u2019 arms and spits out the furry flesh. Due to his victory against the primates, he transforms from a prisoner to a gladiator.",
      "\u201cSuddenly there\u2019s a new alpha in the fight,\u201d Wick said of the scene.",
      "Ginsberg says monkeys were a possibility to appear in the arena, but they were a relatively late development and would have been hunted for sport.",
      "\u201cThe one reference that I found was Antoninus Pius was, at that time, credited with giving, like, the biggest possible Roman games of all time, which every emperor got, so every time it had to be more,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cHe brought monkeys from Africa, but they don\u2019t seem to have been the highlight of that show,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey were there, but they weren\u2019t the most famous animals. He also had rhinoceroses. And people were more into them.\u201d",
      "Other land animals Ginsberg found that took part in arena spectacles include elephants, ostriches, bears, bulls, lions, leopards, tigers, panthers and more.",
      "Ginsberg spoke of a large industry throughout the Roman Empire dedicated to locating exotic animals and transporting them back to the emperor, as well as teams of trainers and caretakers who kept the animals alive \u2014 and ready to fight.",
      "\u201cThere was a whole industry of people from, like, the moment you decided, \u2018I want an elephant from Africa,\u2019 that would be in charge of getting it, storing it, transporting it on a boat, getting it to where it needs to be, under the Colosseum, making sure it doesn\u2019t die, and then making sure it\u2019s ready to go out and give people the show that you want,\u201d she says.",
      "The baboon scene is also a great example of how differently gladiators were treated from prisoners, according to Ginsberg.",
      "\u201cGladiators would never be handcuffed because they\u2019re prized athletes. You came to watch them fight, and so handcuffing them would just not be interesting,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut prisoners, you absolutely wanted them to have no escape, and you also wanted them to die in the most dehumanizing way possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I tell my students, the Romans are jerks. Very interesting, but they\u2019re jerks,\u201d she adds.",
      "Sharks?",
      "In one of Lucius' clashes, the Colosseum is filled with water \u2014 and man-eating tiger sharks \u2014 as dozens of gladiators fight for their lives on ships in a staged naval battle.",
      "Ginsberg says that sharks would have never been in the Colosseum, or any ancient Roman amphitheater. \u201cI\u2019m willing to stake my reputation on this,\u201d she says through laughter.",
      "\u201cI actually have no proof that the Romans even knew what sharks were,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of sharks in the Mediterranean \u2014 it\u2019s not a very common creature ... but I racked my brain trying to think of anyone in the classical world that actually talks about sharks.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg did say that if the Romans knew that something like a great white or a hammerhead shark existed, and could find a way to transport it (Ginsberg notes there was unlikely to be any technology at the time to support such a journey), they would have \u201cbeen all about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey would have thought that was fantastic, and absolutely would have used them all the time, because they especially like sea creatures,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for sure, no.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg says there is evidence to support that some semiaquatic animals, like crocodiles and seals, were used in battles, as it was possible for the Colosseum to be filled with water.",
      "She cites works from Martial, a Roman poet who described watching reenactments of Roman naval engagements, as well as evidence of pipes and drains in the Colosseum itself that seems to suggest water could have been both brought in and removed.",
      "\u201cI think the estimates are, like, five hours to fill it and four hours to drain it,\u201d she says.",
      "Ginsberg adds that prisoners were the most likely to be used in these staged historical mock battles, which mainly showed Rome being triumphant against an easily stereotyped culture, often with exotic costumes.",
      "\u201cThose would not be professional gladiators. Those would often be condemned prisoners, because the idea would be that most of those people would drown and die, right? So you didn\u2019t want your top sports athletes doing that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t there would be, like, extra danger in the water, like sharks or other creatures.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: This story has major spoilers for the ending of \"Wicked: Part 1\" and the Broadway musical.",
      "After hearing the final notes of Cynthia Erivo's powerhouse performance of \"Defying Gravity\" in 2024's \"Wicked,\" fans will have a while to wait to find out what happens next.",
      "\"Everyone's like, 'This is the longest intermission ever,'\" Bowen Yang, who plays Glinda's friend Pfannee, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"Wicked,\" which premieres in theaters Nov. 22, is part one of two films inspired by the hit Broadway musical of the same name. \"Wicked: Part 2\" is expected to come out one year later, in November 2025.",
      "Part 1 of the film adaptation clocks in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it about the same length as the entire \"Wicked\" musical. But the first film is just half of the story, following the events of Act 1 while giving moments \"a chance to breathe,\" the musical's composer Stephen Schwartz says.",
      "Other than expanding certain scenes and adding some dialogue, Part 1 of \"Wicked\" is largely faithful to the stage musical that inspired it. As for Part 2?",
      "\"I want to have the sanctity of the show. I love the show, so to me, that's first and foremost,\" director Jon M. Chu, who is still editing the second film, says. \"It will be the DNA of what it is.\"",
      "Here's what's in store (or could be) for \"Wicked: Part 2,\" based on Act 2 of the musical.",
      "A time jump",
      "Like the 2024 film, Act 1 of \"Wicked\" ends with \"Defying Gravity.\" When the curtain rises again after a 15-minute intermission, a lot has changed.",
      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",
      "Yang confirms there will be a time jump in Part 2 of \"Wicked.\"",
      "\"Right when we pick up, Glinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen\u00a0(Bronwyn James) are at her side still, but a lot is in motion,\" Yang says. \"The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "\"The story is so flexible with how it relates to our real world,\" Yang adds.",
      "A love triangle",
      "Act 2 of the musical also delivers on lingering chemistry and Elphaba's unrequited feelings for Fiyero.",
      "While Elphaba resigned herself to being \"not that girl\" in Act 1, audience members learn in the second act that the reason Fiyero joined the Wizard's army was to take an active role in searching for Elphaba, who has been missing in action but speaking out against the Wizard, his leadership and his treatment of Animals (sentient animals).",
      "When Elphaba tries to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created at the end of Act 1, she runs into the Wizard, who, after a failed attempt to again sway her to his side, turns her in to his guards.",
      "She and Fiyero reunite, and instead of bringing her to the Wizard, he helps her escape and leaves with her, abandoning Glinda.",
      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",
      "A transformation",
      "While Elphaba leads a campaign against the Wizard, her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode in the film), has taken over as governor of Munchkinland in the wake of their father's death and rules harshly. Her relationship with Boq (Ethan Slater) has soured, and he stays by Nessarose's side under duress rather than love.",
      "Elphaba visits Nessarose in Act 2, and the younger sister airs her resentment. Elphaba then casts a spell on Nessarose's silver shoes, allowing her to walk. Boq responds by announcing his intentions to leave and declare his true affections for Glinda.",
      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: Part 2\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",
      "New songs",
      "By breaking up \"Wicked\" into two films, composer Stephen Schwartz and screenplay writer Winnie Holzman had \"freedom\" to let scenes and moments \"breathe.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of scenes that Winnie wrote, there were a couple of songs that I tried for the first movie that we wound up not putting in the movie, but the essence of what we were trying to accomplish got into the movie,\" Schwartz says.",
      "While there aren't any new songs to Part 1, there will be in Part 2.",
      "\"There are two new songs in the second movie because they felt they were dramatically necessary,\" Schwartz says.",
      "But will any songs get cut?",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" Chu says. \"I don't know if I can confirm or deny that, but in my first pass of it right now ... but you never know, I'm still editing it.",
      "\"But I want to have the sanctity of the show,\" he adds. \"If it doesn't fit in one place, and I need to find a place where it does emotionally, or we need to change the lyrics, or we need to do things to change \u2014 but it will be the DNA of what it is.\"",
      "The soundtrack of Act 2 of \"Wicked\" includes:",
      "\"Thank Goodness\" \"Wonderful\" \"I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)\"\"As Long As You're Mine\"\"No Good Deed\" \"March of the Witch Hunters\" \"For Good\" \"Finale\"",
      "\"Thank Goodness\"",
      "\"Wonderful\"",
      "\"I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)\"",
      "\"As Long As You're Mine\"",
      "\"No Good Deed\"",
      "\"March of the Witch Hunters\"",
      "\"For Good\"",
      "\"Finale\"",
      "Overlap with \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019",
      "Act 2 of \"Wicked\" also turns the story into less of a prequel and more of an alternate perspective on the events of original 1939 film \"the Wizard of Oz.\"",
      "After Elphaba and Fiyero run off together, Glinda tells Madame Morrible that the way to draw out her former friend is by targeting her sister. So, using her powers to control the weather, Madame Morrible summons the tornado that lands a house on Nessarose, bringing Dorothy Gale to Oz. Like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" Glinda gives Dorothy Nessarose's shoes and instructs her to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City.",
      "Elphaba arrives after her sister's death to a trap, which results in Fiyero being captured. In the song \"No Good Deed,\" she casts a spell for her beloved to \"feel no pain.\"",
      "In \"March of the Witch Hunters,\" Boq is revealed to be the Tin Man from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and the lion cub Fiyero and Elphaba saved in Act 1 grows up to be none other than Cowardly Lion.",
      "In Act 2, the citizens of Oz storm Elphaba's castle, as she holds Dorothy captive to try and get Nessarose's shoes back. Glinda, realizing the danger of the angry mob against Elphaba, arrives at her friend's side to try and warn her. Elphaba decides to give up the fight and sings the tearful (and iconic) goodbye song \"For Good\" with Glinda.",
      "Glinda hides when the mob arrives and hides behind a curtain to witness the shadowy form of Elphaba melt after Dorothy throws a pail of water on her.",
      "How does the 'Wicked' musical end?",
      "But we\u2019re missing someone from the original \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d quartet \u2014 the scarecrow.",
      "The finale of \u201cWicked\u201d reveals that Elphaba wasn\u2019t actually killed by the pail of water. Elphaba\u2019s spell to protect Fiyero turned him into a scarecrow. After the showdown with Dorothy, he arrives at the castle to bring his love out of the trap door she was hiding in, and they leave Oz together.",
      "Meanwhile, Glinda confronts the Wizard after witnessing Elphaba's \"death,\" bringing the remnants of her melting: Elphaba's hat and the green bottle she always carried that belonged to her mother.",
      "When the Wizard sees the green elixir, he realizes that Elphaba was his biological child, finally unmasking the identity of the man Elphaba's mother had an affair with at the very beginning of the story.",
      "Jeff Goldblum confirms that he's the figure singing in the part of the opening song, \"No One Mourns the Wicked,\" which shows Elphaba's mother having an affair. (He's also credited in the song on the movie's official soundtrack.)",
      "\"You don't see me,\" he says. \"I have this drink, and that's a little mysterious and that will come to light.\"",
      "The camerawork keeps the man's face just out of each frame, so audiences \"aren't supposed to know that it's me,\" he says. But there's a tiny moment for careful listeners that connect the mysterious man to the Wizard in the first film, he says.",
      "After his introduction in \"Wicked,\" Goldblum's version of the Wizard performs a little tap dance and sings, \"You've got to give people what they want,\" in a similar tune to the part he sings in the overture.",
      "\"So if you're listening, and you're subliminally Easter egg-oriented, you might go, 'Is that the guy?'\" Goldblum says.",
      "So wait, the Wicked Witch of the West is alive?",
      "Yes, deviating from the plot of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Wicked Witch of the West is alive at the end of the \"Wicked\" musical.",
      "Elphaba's fate with the scarecrow Fiyero is left unknown.",
      "The musical's ending also differs from Maguire's original book, which sees Elphaba actually melt and die at the hands of Dorothy. Maguire went on to write several sequels to \"Wicked,\" focusing on different Ozian characters, including \"Son of a Witch,\" about Elphaba and Fiyero's son.",
      "So could there be a sequel to the \"Wicked\" musical?",
      "\"We actually have a notion for something, and it's not from Gregory Maguire book,\" Schwartz says. \"That's really all I can say right now. It is something Winnie and I are talking about and exploring, but it actually goes back to Baum, not back to Gregory.\""

    "story": [
      "Jason Kelce\u00a0is ready to blitz the ranks of TV\u2019s late-night hosts in a limited-run wee-hours program on\u00a0ESPN.",
      "\u201cThey Call It\u00a0Late Night\u00a0With Jason Kelce\u201d will air on five consecutive overnights heading into late-season NFL football weekends. The series will run at 1 a.m. on Saturdays starting January 4 on ESPN, with the final broadcast launching at 1:30 a.m.",
      "The one-hour show will originate from Philadelphia, where Kelce enjoyed a a 13-season run in the NFL, and he will hold forth in front of a live crowd at the city\u2019s Union Transfer. Each show will be taped Friday evening, just hours before the program goes to air.",
      "It remains unclear if ESPN sees a future for Kelce around midnight, but the show is said to be something the former football center wanted to try when he joined the Disney sports giant earlier this year, ostensibly as a key addition to \u201cMonday Night Countdown,\u201d the pre-show that leads into \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d",
      "At the time of his hire in May, Disney and ESPN said that \u201cFurther opportunities will be explored.\u201d",
      "Kelce is known for his gridiron prowess, but also for an outsized personality. He and his brother, Travis, host a popular weekly podcast, \u201cNew Heights,\u201d and he has made a handful of TV appearances, including in the WWE\u2019s WrestleMania.",
      "He will make a late-night play in what is relatively safe space. None of the best-known late-night programs on ABC, CBS and NBC run original broadcasts\u00a0on Friday nights any longer, and the main Friday-night option, HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d is on earlier in the evening. As for late-night programs aimed at sports fans, most of them already air on ESPN, which\u00a0features Scott Van Pelt in an end-of-the-night version of \u201cSportsCenter.\u201d",
      "The show will have many of the trappings to which late-night fans have become accustomed. There will be live music from the Philadelphia band Snacktime. Kelce and guests are expected to examine the coming weekend\u2019s games, and will look for fans at the venue to take part in the proceedings.",
      "The programming gambit should, at the very least, draw younger crowds to NFL play. The show will debut hours before the last weekend of NFL regular-season play, with subsequent hours leading into Super Wild Card, Divisional and Conference Championship weekends before the finale ahead of the Pro Bowl Games and nine days from Super Bowl LIX.",
      "ESPN will televise original broadcasts of the show, but also make each episode available on ESPN+, ESPN YouTube and the Jason Kelce channel on YouTube presented by ESPN. Replays will air on ESPN2.\u00a0NFL Films will produce the show in conjunction with Kelce\u2019s Wooderboy Productions and Skydance Sports.",
      "While the show is new, it makes some nods to history. The program\u2019s title pays homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d the first full-length project from NFL Films, The original feature was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2012, cited as an example of how football and sports were showcased on television following its creation. Time will tell whether a similar honor is accorded Kelce\u2019s new project."

      "\u201cI was part of an all-girl crew, up before dawn.\u00a0The hard work has given me a lasting sympathy for field labor and for people who work in the sugar industry,\u201d Erdrich said.",
      "A member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Erdrich's award-winning, best-selling novels center around Native American communities. Her novel \"The Night Watchman,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2021, was inspired by her grandfather, Patrick Gourneau.",

      "It didn\u2019t take long for BookToker Asia Lin to understand that \u201cWicked,\u201d the book by Gregory Maguire, would be nothing like the musical she had first seen months earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was the first page,\u201d Lin tells TODAY.com, recalling a scene in which Dorothy and her companions discuss a rumor that Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, is intersex. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait. Hold on. This was not in the musical at all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Content creator Sara Ribeiro, who grew up listening to \u201cWicked\u201d in a musical theater-loving family, experienced a visceral shock while reading the book this year.",
      "\u201c(The book) ended up being a lot darker than I thought. I would say within the first 10 to 20%, my jaw was on the floor multiple times. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so \u2026 graphic,\u201d she says.",
      "With the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d debuting in theaters Nov. 22 (and the second and final part coming in 2025), TikTokers like Lin and Ribeiro are discovering the novel and sharing their experiences \u2014 from surprise to admiration \u2014 in real time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone warn me?\u201d Lin asks in a TikTok, echoing many other fans.",
      "Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\u201d\u2014 a revisionist take on L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d \u2014 originally published in 1995 and was followed by multiple other books to make a series. \u201cWicked\u201d the musical made its Broadway debut in 2003.",
      "The book and musical could be distilled to the same plot summary: Behold, the unexpected backstory of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda the Good. But the ways the book and musical convey its themes \u2014 like injustice, identity and friendship \u2014 is what distinguishes the two.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both about a young woman named Elphaba \u2014\u00a0but very different. The best way I can explain is like when your parents would hide vegetables in your food, and you wouldn\u2019t notice it. That\u2019s kind of what they did with the musical,\u201d Meredith Ammons, a content creator, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Whereas the musical hides its political message behind \u201cfluff,\u201d Ammons says, the book \u201chits you over the head with it.\u201d She continues, \u201cIt\u2019s like reading a children\u2019s Bible for the first time versus reading the actual Bible for the first time, and how differently the tones are.\u201d",
      "The plight of Animals \u2014 conscious animals \u2014 takes center stage in the book, as does Elphaba\u2019s activism. Not so much a side character, the Wizard is rather a full-fledged dictatorial force committing massacres on the hinterlands of Oz and amassing power. While political allegory is the B-plot to \u201cWicked\u201d the musical, which centers on Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s friendship, it\u2019s the main storyline of Maguire\u2019s book.",
      "Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d doesn\u2019t contain hallmarks from the musical, like a \u201cPopular\u201d-esque union between Glinda and Elphaba. But it takes detours the musical never would have space for \u2014 long explanations of religious sects, descriptions of terrain never mentioned in the musical and, well, quite a bit of R-rated content.",
      "For example: Elphaba bites off a midwife\u2019s finger as an newborn; her parents are involved in what is essentially a loving throuple with a Quadling man named Turtle Heart; Fiyero is a child groom married off at 7. Plus, there is inclusion of sexual assault, bestiality, murder, racism and politics.",
      "\u201cTrigger warning for everything. If you can think of it, it\u2019s in here,\u201d Eryn Kieffer, whose multipart read-along of \u201cWicked\u201d has amassed millions of views on TikTok, said in a video.",
      "Kieffer\u2019s series goes into all the graphic scenes she wasn\u2019t expecting \u2014 like the Clock of the Time Dragon\u2019s puppet show or the Philosophy Club scenes, which have become shorthand for the book\u2019s surprising sexual detours.",
      "Among \u201cWicked\u201d fans, the book\u2019s content is divisive. Kieffer, on her end, said that the sexual content \u201cmuddles the plot.\u201d",
      "Ribeiro says she loves the \u201cshock value\u201d in the books and that the unexpected parts were her favorite to read \u2014 but ultimately took away from what she considered the \u201cpoint\u201d of the book.",
      "\u201cI think I was so distracted by all of the weird stuff that was going on that the political aspect of it was overshadowed,\u201d she says.",
      "Meanwhile, TikToker Aynsley Broom worries the focus on salaciousness takes attention from the book\u2019s more powerful parts about the rise of authoritarianism, which she sees as a \u201cmirror\u201d to the news. In the book, the Wizard of Oz is a despot who ostracizes and marginalizes entire classes of Ozians, not to mention Animals.",
      "\u201cI saw a video that was like, \u2018(The book) explicitly describes (Elphaba\u2019s) pubic hair.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Not really. The book just said it was purple and then moved on,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cTo me, the stuff people are focusing on is completely missing the message. The message needs to be talked more about than the shocking parts, which to me, weren\u2019t that shocking. Granted, I also read a lot of romance novels.\u201d",
      "In the book, she sees a more substantial offering than the musical \u2014 calling the former \u201ca great dinner\u201d and the latter \u201ccotton candy.\u201d",
      "Broom is among the readers who want a more faithful adaptation of Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d than another retelling of the more saccharine musical.\u00a0\u201cI think people want fluff, and we don\u2019t need more fluff,\u201d she says.",
      "Maguire, on his end, seems at peace with the adaptation. During a 2020 interview pegged to the book\u2019s anniversary, he said the musical\u2019s composer, Stephen Schwartz, presented his vision during a walk in Connecticut, and that he felt they were aligned \u2014 that Schwartz understood his book and the moral universe it\u2019s set in.",
      "\u201cI came home and I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to let this happen, I don\u2019t care about the money. This is far more in line with why I wrote the book than the movie scripts I\u2019ve read so far,\u2019\u201d he told Broadway World.",
      "Maguire said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the way Schwartz and book writer Winnie Holzman told the story.",
      "\u201cIt made efficient, economic and narrative sense for them to make the story choices that they chose to do, and I applaud it completely. The play is a little less subtle than the novel in some ways. And I wanted the novel to be more ambiguous because that\u2019s the nature of how I was trying to tell my story,\u201d he said.",
      "What TikTokers generally agree on, though, is that \u201cWicked\u201d the book is certainly not as kid-friendly as \u201cWicked\u201d the musical.",
      "Creators like TikToker Sal Currie are remarking on their experiences reading the books as kids, and giving a heads up to parents who might be persuaded by the newly rebranded cover.",
      "\u201cMy main thing is \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s not for kids. It\u2019s really, truly not for children. The musical is completely fine for kids. I would not say this book is at all,\u201d Kieffer tells TODAY.com.",
      "Ammons says her mom bought the book when she was a young child. She asked if she could read it.",
      "\u201cShe said, \u2018Absolutely not.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 And she said, \u2018You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older,\u2019\u201d she says. Ammons ultimately waited until she was 22 to read Maguire\u2019s novel. \u201cMy first reaction was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m glad I waited to read this, because my mom was right on this one,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Others think reading, and being bewildered by, \u201cWicked\u201d is a rite of passage: \u201cIt\u2019s a canon event for most \u2018Wicked\u2019 fans,\u201d one comment on Currie\u2019s post reads. \u201cWe must not interfere.\u201d"

      "Both have their origins in Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 revisionist prequel, which suggested events that might have shaped the characters in L. Frank Baum\u2019s 1900 novel \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\u201d Baum's book inspired the 1939 classic starring Judy Garland, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d the movie, which stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, dips into the past and examines how Elphaba and Galinda (later Glinda) started their own journey to becoming the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch of the North.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d is full of Easter eggs and references to 1939 movie that should delight all fans. So what do you need to know about \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d before starting down the yellow brick road with \u201cWicked\u201d? Read on.",
      "What happens in \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019?",
      "In the 1939 movie, Dorothy Gale (Garland) is a orphaned young woman growing up on her aunt and uncle\u2019s farm during the Dust Bowl, and dreams of escaping \u201cover the rainbow\u201d someday.",
      "She runs away when a local woman\u2019s complaint that Dorothy\u2019s dog Toto bit her means the dog must be put down. Convinced to return home by a traveling fortune-teller called Professor Marvel, Dorothy arrives mid-tornado and is hit in the head. The house appears to lift into the storm\u2019s funnel \u2014 depositing her in a new world.",
      "Dorothy is delighted by the local Munchkins of Munchkinland but enveloped in a tragedy: Her house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and her sister the Wicked Witch of the West vows vengeance. The Wicked Witch of the West also wants the pair of shoes the Good Witch of the North has gifted Dorothy from the dead witch.",
      "Desiring only to get home, Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road to visit Emerald City and the Wizard, who she hears holds the key to her return home.",
      "Along the way, she makes friends with The Scarecrow (who wants a brain); the Tin Man (who wants a heart); and the Cowardly Lion (who wants courage).",
      "After several adventures, they meet the Wizard (or at least, a giant floating green head with a booming voice that scares them) who says he\u2019ll give them all what they want if they bring them the Witch\u2019s broomstick, proving she\u2019s dead.",
      "How does \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 end?",
      "Dorothy and Toto are first captured by the Witch\u2019s flying monkeys, but freed by their companions, only to be chased by the Witch and her guards. When the Witch sets the Scarecrow\u2019s arm on fire, Dorothy splashes him with water \u2014 that also lands on the Witch, melting her.",
      "They bring the broomstick to the Wizard, who tries to dodge their requests, until Toto reveals a man behind a curtain who\u2019s operating all the special effects. He offers to take her home in the hot air balloon that brought him to Oz, but Dorothy misses her flight while chasing Toto and seems stuck in Oz.",
      "Then, Glinda reveals an even easier way back to Kansas: Dorothy can click her heels together and wish to be home. After some fond farewells, Dorothy invokes the shoe spell and she and Toto go home.",
      "But did they ever leave? Dorothy wakes in her own bed, surrounded by farmhands who look like the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Everyone insists she had a vivid dream. Dorothy is just happy to be home and discovers the film\u2019s true meaning: That home is the best place of all.",
      "How does \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 connect to \u2018Wicked\u2019?",
      "Throughout \u201cWicked,\u201d characters and scenes often contain touchstones from the 1939 movie, starting with that hat on the water and the Witch\u2019s killers marching off to Emerald City.",
      "But not everything connects \u2026 yet. Elphaba doesn\u2019t start off so wicked in \u201cWicked: Part One,\u201d for example. She\u2019s actually tormented for her green skin (sure, Oz is a magic world but there are some things the locals really don\u2019t tolerate).",
      "Galinda doesn\u2019t start out particularly good, either; she\u2019s self-absorbed and self-assured to the point of annoyance. But colors are significant here: Just like in \u201cOz,\u201d Elphaba is green, and Galinda/Glinda is as pink as Barbie (and travels in her own literal bubble).",
      "In \u201cWicked: Part One,\u201d Elphaba does have a sister, but we never see anything of that sister in \u201cOz\u201d except for her legs sticking out from under the house. Nessarose's shoes (Marissa Bode) in \u201cWicked: Part One\u201d aren't ruby \u2014 they\u2019re bedazzled and silvery (much like in Baum's \u201cWonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d and Maguire's \u201cWicked\u201d).",
      "There are other shout-outs to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked: Part One\u201d The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) enlists Elphaba and Galinda to help him decide on a color for a super-sidewalk that will thread throughout Oz that he\u2019s building (yellow, naturally, wins).",
      "Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) joins Elphaba and Galinda at school and helps Elphaba rescue a lion cub \u2014 it\u2019s not directly stated in the film, but there\u2019s a good chance that cub\u2019s going to have a connection to being cowardly someday.",
      "Then there are some confusing moments. For a woman who should have discovered by now that water can hurt her, Elphaba is quite unbothered by it in \u201cPart One,\u201d going so far as to dance on flagstones that cross a stream at the school. Surely there\u2019s more to learn about this seeming inconsistency in \u201cPart Two.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart One\u201d also underscores the poppy as a significant flower: They\u2019re the favorites of a professor at Shiz University who Elphaba takes a shine to. At one point, she releases a spell that causes the flowers\u2019 scent to knock out nearly everyone in the classroom. This is a direct reference to a scene in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d where Wicked Elphaba creates a field of poppies to slow down Dorothy and her friends on their way to Emerald City.",
      "Of course, there are still more reveals to come in \u201cPart Two,\u201d currently slated for theaters on Nov. 26, 2025. Until then, keep following the yellow brick road!"

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s been nearly 25 years, but the Oscar-winning \u201cGladiator\u201d is back! Or, at least, a sequel is!",
      "True, \"Gladiator\" star Russell Crowe can\u2019t return as Maximus (for obvious reasons), but \u201cGladiator II\u201d \u00a0is packed full of nostalgia, familiar characters and callbacks to the 2000 film.",
      "It\u2019s also stuffed with much of the spectacle that made the first film such a success: brutal fights with animals and humans in the Coliseum, political intrigue, class warfare and a hero who fights with determined purpose.",
      "So what do we need to know about this sword-and-sandals epic before it opens wide on Nov. 22? Here's what to know.",
      "Note: Light spoilers are included regarding both films.",
      "Do you need to watch \u2018Gladiator\u2019 to follow along with \u2018Gladiator II\u2019?",
      "Not necessarily, but it helps. The key fact of the film: That Maximus had a son who ends up in the arena, and leading a revolt is already part of the early trailers.",
      "But it\u2019s not critical, because the film makes liberal use of flashbacks to the previous film to help fill in the blanks.",
      "What is Lucius\u2019 connection to the first \u2018Gladiator\u2019?",
      "In \u201cGladiator,\u201d Lucius is an incidental character.",
      "Played by Spencer Treat Clark, the boy is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and it\u2019s stated that his father is Lucilla\u2019s late husband, Lucius Verus (Lucius\u2019 namesake).",
      "Lucilla, by the way, is the sister of the leader in the first film, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).",
      "But we also learn in that film that Lucilla had an on-again, off-again relationship with Maximus, so it\u2019s not a huge surprise to discover that the script for \u201cII\u201d has retconned Lucius (Paul Mescal) into being a more significant player: that is, Maximus\u2019 son.",
      "For his safety, the boy Lucius is shown to being spirited away and raised elsewhere \u2014 when he finally meets Lucilla in \u201cII,\u201d he claims to barely remember her.",
      "Who from the original \u2018Gladiator\u2019 appears?",
      "Aside from the actors in the flashbacks, there are two key performers who show up in \u201cII\u201d \u2014 Nielsen, who has remarried the man Lucius blames for murdering his family, Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) \u2014 and Derek Jacobi, who plays Senator Graccus. In \u201cGladiator,\u201d he was part of the plot with Maximus and Lucilla to overthrow Commodus.",
      "And technically, Ridley Scott is also a return from the original \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 as the director of both films. He was nominated for best director in 2001, so maybe he\u2019s hoping to win that Oscar this time around.",
      "How does Maximus play a part in the new film?",
      "In a way, he\u2019s everywhere. Adult Lucius doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Maximus\u2019 son, and he\u2019s worshiped the warrior all these years.",
      "There are several callbacks that suggest their connection before it\u2019s stated explicitly: The image of Maximus running his hand through wheat field grasses shows up early on, and when Lucius is in the arena he sticks his sword in the ground, leans down and runs sand through his hands \u2014 just like his father did.",
      "Then, during \u201cGladiator,\u201d Maximus has a maxim he loves to share: \u201cWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\" The aphorism makes an appearance in \u201cII\u201d to lend it depth and scope.",
      "But the biggest contribution Maximus makes to the film (Lucius aside) comes when his son visits a tomb beneath the arena and is given his father\u2019s armor and sword for a big challenge.",
      "Who\u2019s been maintaining that all these years? How does it look so shiny and spiffy? Why does it naturally fit Lucius perfectly? These things can all be answered by whispering the name of a distant, future land far from Rome \u2026 Hollywood."

    "story": [
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" is a tried-and-true family musical classic.",
      "More than 80 years later, \"Wicked,\" a prequel to the beloved film based on the Broadway musical of the same name, will hit theaters on Nov. 22.",
      "But is \"Wicked\" \u2014 which follows the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good \u2014 also family-friendly?",
      "\"Wicked\" was rated PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested, and some material may not be suitable for young children.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the kid-friendliness of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Is 'Wicked' for kids?",
      "Yes, \"Wicked\" is for kids, director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com.",
      "Chu says two of his five children, age 7 and 5, have seen \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy 3-year-old did not see it yet, but I\u2019m going to bring her,\u201d he adds.",
      "\"Wicked\" is rated PG for \"some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material.\"",
      "For parents of young kids, Chu notes: Beware the flying monkeys.",
      "Toward the end of \"Wicked,\" viewers learn the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West's famous henchman, her flying monkeys. Instead of costumed actors like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" uses computer-generated imagery for the monkeys (and all the other animals in the film, including a lion cub, bear and goat).",
      "Chu says the monkeys are \"definitely not as creepy\" as they were in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" However, a Washington Post review of the film argues the flying monkeys are more terrifying with CGI, warning parents, \"this is not a movie for very young children.\"",
      "As for thematic and brief suggestive material, the film does feature some romance. There's an onscreen kiss and an implied sexual encounter in one of the film's first scenes.",
      "What age is 'Wicked' appropriate for?",
      "Common Sense Media rates the film as appropriate for kids aged 10 and up, citing \"(light) jump-scares\" involving the flying monkeys, the Wizard of Oz's giant avatar head and the bullying Cynthia Erivo's character Elphaba experiences.",
      "The film is also long, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes in the theater, not including any previews.",
      "The original Broadway musical that the film is based on is recommended for children age 8 and up, and children under 5 years old are not admitted, according to the \"Wicked\" musical's website. The 1995 book that inspired the musical, Gregory Maguire's  \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch,\" is not for children and includes swearing, sex, violence and more mature themes.",
      "Chu overall describes his 2024 \u201cWicked\u201d film as \u201caccessible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about a relationship, and that relationship is nuanced \u2014 we\u2019ll see if kids pick that up,\u201d Chu says, referring to the complex friendship between Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande).",
      "\u201cI think they will fall in love with this friendship and this world. And there\u2019s a lot of things to look at and be enamored by,\u201d Chu says. \u201cBut in the end, I think they will love these two friends. And I think as a young person, when you\u2019re meeting new friends, I think that all connects with them, too.\u201d"

      "\u201cWhy is it, you think, that men always fall in love with you?\u201d Smith asked.",
      "\u201cHow can you not?\u201d someone in the audience said.",
      "\u201cLook at her!\u201d another screamed.",
      "Cher was married to Sonny Bono until the two divorced in 1975, and she tied the knot with Gregg Allman days after her first divorce was finalized. The two also had their fair share of issues, including Allman's battle with addiction, and divorced a few years after their wedding. She also dated music executive David Geffen and Kiss rocker Gene Simmons. She reflects on all of the relationships in her memoir.",
      "More recently, she\u2019s been linked to music executive Alexander \u201cAE\u201d Edwards.",
      "In response to Smith\u2019s question, Cher was a little shy.",
      "\u201cShould I just say all this stuff? It sounds so \u2014\u201d she started, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a really good girlfriend, and I learned how to do this.\u201d",
      "The 78-year-old also described herself as \u201creally funny\u201d and \u201csweet-ish.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m monogamous,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I know that if I look at a man while I\u2019m with my boyfriend, it\u2019s over, because I don\u2019t look at men. I don\u2019t see men. If I\u2019m with someone that I love, the moment I see a boy it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, goodbye!\u2019 But no, I\u2019m a really good girlfriend.\u201d",
      "That habit is one that was instilled in Cher early on, as detailed in her memoir, when she writes multiple times about Bono not allowing her to interact with other men. In one instance, she recalled when he burned her tennis clothes after finding out from a friend she went to a party after one of her tennis lessons and was seen talking to some men.",
      "\u201cI was so pissed off at that,\u201d Cher said while telling the story to Smith.",
      "While grappling with the decision to leave Bono, Cher called friend Lucille Ball, who divorced her famous husband and TV partner, Desi Arnaz, for advice.",
      "In her book, Cher wrote, \u201cI told her, \u2018Lucy, I want to leave Sonny and you\u2019re the only one I know that\u2019s ever been in this same situation. What should I do?\u2019\u201d",
      "The singer said Ball responded, \u201cF--- him, you\u2019re the one with the talent.\u201d",
      "Cher also shared another fun tidbit with fans during her book talk about Ball.",
      "\u201cI want to tell you something that\u2019s really embarrassing, though,\u201d the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer said to Smith.",
      "She explained that because she has dyslexia, she doesn\u2019t know her address or phone number.",
      "\u201cIf people want to find me, they will,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have my mobile. If I want to know what my phone number is, I just click to \u2018Lucille Ball.\u2019 That\u2019s what my name is,\u201d she revealed.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not in the book,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s good stuff.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ali Musa Daqduq had been a wanted man since 2007 when militants posing as an American security team killed five U.S. soldiers in the Iraqi city of Karbala.",
    "story": [
      "A recent Israeli airstrike in Syria killed a senior Hezbollah commander who helped plan one of the boldest and most sophisticated attacks against American troops during the Iraq War, according to a senior U.S. defense official.",
      "Ali Mussa Daqduq had been captured by U.S. forces following the 2007 raid in which militants posing as an American security team killed five U.S. soldiers. But he was later released by the Iraqi government.",
      "Details of the Israeli airstrike were scarce. It was not immediately clear when the strike took place, where in Syria or whether it targeted Daqduq specifically, the senior defense official said.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli embassy referred questions to its military, which did not immediately respond.",
      "The elaborate raid Daqduq helped plan was carried out at a U.S.-Iraqi military complex in Karbala on Jan. 20, 2007. A group of men posing as an American military security team \u2013 wearing U.S. military combat fatigues, carrying U.S. weapons and some speaking English \u2013 convinced security to let them through several checkpoints and right up to a building where U.S. and Iraqi troops were working.",
      "The facility was part of a series of compounds known as Joint Security Stations in Iraq, where U.S. troops lived and worked with the Iraqi police and soldiers. More than two dozen U.S. soldiers were in the Provisional Joint Coordination Center, or PJCC, when the militants arrived, including several in the barracks room where the troops were living.",
      "The militants surrounded the building, using grenades and explosives to breach the entrance. One American soldier was killed by a grenade. Once inside, the militants captured two U.S. soldiers inside the building and two others outside the building, before speeding away in waiting SUVs.",
      "U.S. attack helicopters caught up with the convoy, prompting the militants to bolt from their vehicles and take off by foot. They shot and killed the four U.S. captives at some point during the escape.",
      "The four soldiers shot by their captors were identified as 1st Lt. Jacob Noel Fritz, 25; Capt. Brian Scott Freeman, 31; Pfc. Shawn Patrick Falter, 25; and Spc. Johnathan Bryan Chism, 22. The soldier killed by the grenade at the compound was identified as Pfc. Johnathon Miles Millican, 22.",
      "In the aftermath of the attack, U.S. officials suspected the militants had direct support from Iran, given the level of coordination, training and intelligence required to carry it out.",
      "U.S. forces captured Daqduq in March 2007 and soon achieved a breakthrough in establishing that Iran's Quds Force, an elite unit of the country's Revolutionary Guard, was involved in planning the Karbala raid. Under questioning, Daqduq said the operation resulted from direct support and training by the Quds Force.",
      "Daqduq was held by the U.S. military in Iraq for several years but then handed over to Iraqi authorities in December 2011, when the U.S. military mission ended. He was the last prisoner handed over before U.S. troops pulled out of the country.",
      "The Iraqis assured U.S. officials that they would prosecute Daqduq, but within months he was released, prompting outrage from American officials and politicians. Daqduq was soon leading Hezbollah fighters once again, the senior U.S. defense official said."

    "summary": "Nearly 50,000 people from 200 countries were in Azerbaijan for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, with the goal of reaching a climate finance deal.",
    "story": [
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan \u2014 Ambitious climate action often requires ambitious financing \u2014 be it a clean energy transition project or helping developing countries mitigate the effects of natural disasters.",
      "But as extreme weather becomes more the norm and temperatures rise across the planet, what is supposed to be a critical year for funding mitigation efforts has instead turned out to be an especially frustrating one.",
      "Nearly 50,000 people from 200 countries \u2014 including, for the first time, the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan \u2014 were in Azerbaijan for this year\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference, with the goal of reaching a critical deal on climate finance. The conference was set to end\u00a0Friday but negotiations over funding extended into the weekend.",
      "A draft of a deal to help the world adapt to and deal with climate change released at the conference, known as COP29, pledged $250 billion annually by 2035 from wealthy countries to poorer ones. While rich nations say it\u2019s realistic and about the limit of what they can do, it is less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather.",
      "The conference was already shadowed by the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement climate change treaty the first time he was president and has vowed to do so again. The atmosphere had also been dampened by poor attendance by world leaders, particularly from wealthy nations.",
      "Developing countries are seeking $1 trillion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from developed economies, to transition to green energy and adapt to extreme weather driven by climate change.",
      "As the World Meteorological Organization says 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, some experts are so worried they are calling for a completely new approach. In an open letter published last week, signatories including former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the whole framework of U.N. climate talks is \u201cno longer fit for purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can choose to be proactive about climate, and the time for being proactive is rapidly shrinking,\u201d said Ruth Townend, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House who attended the conference. \u201cOr we can choose to be reactive, which is much more expensive, much harder and has a higher human cost.\u201d",
      "Some of the highest human costs will be paid by smaller nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including Pacific Island nations whose existence is threatened by rising seas. But with COP29 weighed down by geopolitics and domestic turmoil, some were reluctant to attend at all.",
      "Deepening divides",
      "Top leaders from a number of major economies were notably absent in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.",
      "They included President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters. Though British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did attend, most other leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries did not, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "While the bulk of the work happens among lower-level negotiators during long nights in windowless rooms, the presence of heads of state has symbolic value, Townend said.",
      "\u201cIt is really disappointing to see that world leaders haven\u2019t shown up in force in solidarity,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite his physical absence, one person whose presence has been felt here is Trump.",
      "U.S. officials have sought to reassure conference attendees after Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "While Trump \u201cmay put climate action on the back burner,\u201d U.S. climate envoy John Podesta said, \u201cthe work to contain climate change is going to continue.\u201d",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said states, cities, nongovernmental organizations and companies are still \u201call-in\u201d on pursuing climate goals. She also noted that 80% of the funding from Biden\u2019s two signature bills, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has gone to Republican districts including to promote the manufacturing of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.",
      "She said Trump could slow, but not stop, U.S. climate efforts.",
      "\u201cIt would be political malpractice to undo those opportunities when people are just now getting hired,\u201d Granholm told NBC News. Some 400,000 people have been hired because of the bills, she added.",
      "Even companies that stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration have expressed concern. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said he hoped the Trump administration would take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to reducing emissions and remain in the Paris Agreement.",
      "Meeting the goals under the agreement, which include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures, could cost as much as $8 trillion annually, according to a report released last week by the Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance.",
      "Who foots the bill?",
      "Nations that are highly affected by climate change despite being relatively small emitters themselves have grown frustrated with major polluting countries they see as shirking responsibility for helping them cover the costs and trying to hold back their development in the name of environmental protection.",
      "The host of the conference, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, struck a tone of defiance in his keynote address, saying countries like his should not be castigated for exporting fossil fuels, especially by the U.S. and other wealthy nations that continue to rely on them.",
      "Aliyev and others whose countries have developed more recently, many of which were colonized by the West, say they should not be punished economically for the past emissions of wealthier nations.",
      "\u201cWho created this pollution that we have? It\u2019s 120 years of industrial revolution,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s climate envoy, Adel Al-Jubeir, said.",
      "Lord Adair Turner of Britain, who chairs a global coalition known as the Energy Transitions Commission, said the Saudi climate envoy was living in a \u201cdiplomatic fantasy land.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Saudi Arabia to say \u2014 with its level of per capita income \u2014 that it\u2019s a developing country is an insult to true developing countries like in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are going to have to have financial flows not just from rich developed countries in the classic sense in the G7, but also from the rich countries of the Middle East and indeed also from China.\u201d",
      "Though China industrialized later than many of the world\u2019s biggest polluters, analysts from the U.K.-based Carbon Brief said during the conference that China had surpassed the European Union as the world\u2019s second-biggest historical emitter after the United States.",
      "The infighting has only further exasperated Pacific Island nations such as Papua New Guinea, whose Prime Minister James Marape said in August that it would boycott the Baku conference as \u201ca protest at the big nations\u201d that continue emitting while balking at paying.",
      "Marape did eventually send a delegation under pressure from activists.",
      "Even as many world leaders skipped the conference or tried to, it also had first-time attendees from Taliban-led Afghanistan. Though the Taliban have struggled to gain international recognition over their rollback of women\u2019s rights and other abuses, Afghanistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "The agriculture-reliant country has been pushed into a \u201cperil position,\u201d said Asadullah Jawid, an assistant professor at the American University of Afghanistan who has studied the effects of climate change on the country\u2019s farmers.",
      "\u201cDecades of war and instability, economic challenges, devastated infrastructure and an impoverished workforce have left Afghanistan with few resources for climate adaptation initiatives,\u201d he said.",

      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu's office branding the decision \"antisemitic,\" rejecting the charges as \"absurd and false\" and condemning the ICC as a \"biased and discriminatory political body.\"",
      "Hamas welcomed the warrants as an \"important step towards justice\" but senior political official Basem Naim said the court's decision \"remains limited and symbolic if it is not supported by all means by all countries around the world to implement it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that the U.S. \u201cfundamentally rejects the Court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials\" and that it was \"deeply concerned by the prosecutor\u2019s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.\"",

      "In its announcement Thursday the ICC rejected challenges from Israel to its jurisdiction. It said the warrants issued for Netanyahu and Gallant were related to \"crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October, 2023 until at least 20 May, 2024,\" including \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\"",

      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",

      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",
      "The Hostage Family Forum said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cappalled by the ongoing efforts of individuals close to the prime minister to sabotage a potential hostage deal.\u201d",
      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

      "President Joe Biden has authorized Kyiv to use U.S. weapons for strikes deep inside Russia, according to two U.S. officials \u2014 a major policy shift that drew a furious response from the Kremlin on Monday, accusing the administration of pouring \"oil on the fire\" two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Crucially for Ukraine, the decision comes after months of pleading and just as Russia has intensified a wave of aerial attacks that forced widespread blackouts and killed more than a dozen people, according to local officials.",
      "\"It is excellent news for us and a significant move,\" Kyiv resident  Maryna Vlasenko, 39, told NBC News.",
      "She also bemoaned the lengthy process and the continued limits on Ukraine's use of the long-range weapons, however. \u201cSometimes I just have a feeling that we are receiving the bare minimum in order not to die, and with such an attitude, Ukraine will bleed to death,\u201d  Vlasenko said in an interview Monday.",
      "\u201cBut it is better to have such a decision now than not having it at all.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has for months rebuffed Kyiv's pleas to lift the restrictions on its usage of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in the Kursk border region of Russia. But with Kim Jong Un sending thousands of North Korean troops to help the Kremlin's forces retake land there occupied by Ukraine, the U.S. ally will now be able to use the weapons in and around Kursk.",
      "Moscow is not just pressing on the battlefield.",
      "It has also ramped up its aerial assault against its neighbor with days of widespread attacks hitting civilian targets and critical infrastructure ahead of winter.",
      "At least 11 people, including two children, were killed in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday, local officials said. And 10 people were killed in the historic southern city of Odesa, local officials said Monday.",
      "Dozens more people were reported injured in the missile and drone strikes, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \u201cone of the largest and most dangerous\u201d attacks of the entire war. They also hammered Ukraine\u2019s power grid, leading the state operator to announce rolling power cuts in areas across the country on the eve of the 1,000th day since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "\"The week was just awful and terrifying,\" Vlasenko said in Kyiv. \"I don\u2019t have tears to cry any more, it is pure pain. I am afraid we will stay with no electricity and water again this winter. We are exhausted.\"",
      "A battlefield boost?",
      "While the White House has not publicly confirmed the reversal, the Kremlin said that if true it would amount to a \u201cnew leap of tension and a qualitatively new situation with regard to the U.S. involvement in this conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have talked about this, to continue to pour oil on the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tension around this conflict,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday.",
      "Russian media also blasted the move, with government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta saying Sunday that Biden had taken \u201cone of the most provocative, ill-considered decisions\" of his time in office,  \"which risks catastrophic consequences.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee for national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz,  also appeared to raise concerns. In an interview Monday morning on \"Fox & Friends,\" the Florida congressman said: \u201cIt\u2019s another step up the escalation ladder. And nobody knows where this is going.\u201d",
      "Despite the warnings and protestations, however, analysts said it was unlikely that the U.S. decision would either provoke major escalation from the Kremlin or do significant damage to the Russian military's positions on the front lines, which have broadly been improving with each passing day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too little and too late,\u201d said Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to bomb Ukrainians into the dark ages,\u201d he said in an interview from Kyiv. \u201cHow much worse could it get now?\u201d",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art technology has helped to create an avatar of the voice and face of Britain's Richard III over 500 years after his death in battle.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "\u201cThere is no countermeasure to such a\u00a0missile, no means of intercepting it,\" Putin said in televised comments, according to Reuters. \"And I\u00a0will emphasize once again that we will continue testing this\u00a0newest system. It is necessary to establish serial production.\"",
      "Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said its attack using the hypersonic \u201cOreshnik\u201d\u00a0missile was a warning to Ukraine\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d Western allies.",
      "On Thursday, Putin said he had ordered a strike with the new intermediate-range ballistic missile in response to Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia for the first time.",
      "Despite Moscow\u2019s deployment of the new weapon, which carried multiple warheads, the United States and its European partners have vowed not to be deterred in their support for Kyiv.",
      "Meanwhile, new details were emerging about the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued his own nuclear threat to his U.S.-backed southern neighbor and accused Washington of fueling tensions.",
      "The latest round of saber rattling from Putin and Kim has come during a week in which the war in Ukraine passed 1,000 days and with Washington preparing for a change in leadership.",
      "Still, Western officials and analysts have sought to play down what they said was an effort to intimidate Kyiv and its backers.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried the use of the new missile on the eastern city of Dnipro as a \"severe escalation.\" He also announced that Ukraine was holding meetings with its \"partners\" about new air defense systems to counter any new threats.",
      "On Thursday, he said the Russian missile strike was a second major step toward escalation after the Kremlin's deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops.",
      "On Friday, Kim warned that due to U.S. hostility, his region had never faced a greater risk of \"the most destructive thermonuclear war,\" according to the KCNA state news agency.",
      "The Kim-Putin alliance was likely one factor behind the decision of Washington and its allies to relax restrictions on Kyiv. And NATO, the Western military alliance bracing for a second Donald Trump presidency, said it would not stop that support in the face of Putin's threats.",
      "\u201cDeploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,\u201d alliance spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said.",
      "Biden administration officials briefed Ukraine and other allies in recent days to help them prepare for Russia possibly using the new weapon, according to a U.S. official.",
      "\u201cRussia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict,\u201d the U.S. official said.",
      "Ukraine's use of long-range Western weapons to strike Russian soil followed months of pleading during which it came under intensifying Russian attacks in the air and on the battlefield.",
      "In a sign of the danger felt on the ground, the Ukrainian Parliament canceled a session Friday and reduced staff presence because of the increased threat of a missile attack on the area housing government buildings, the country\u2019s public broadcaster said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Beluosov said that his forces had sped up their advance and \u201cdisrupted\u201d the Ukrainian military\u2019s plans for the upcoming year.",
      "On a visit to a command post of the country\u2019s \u201cnorth\u201d group of forces \u2014 the group targeted by a Ukrainian strike in the Kursk border region that used British Storm Shadow long-range missiles \u2014 Beluosov said that Ukraine\u2019s \u201cbest units were ground down here\u201d and that \"the advancement [of the Russian Armed Forces] has accelerated.\u201d",

      "Kyiv initially claimed that Russia had fired an ICBM.",

      "McGregor testified that he never forced the woman to do anything against her will and said she fabricated the allegations after the two had consensual sex.",
      "The woman\u2019s lawyer said she never pretended to be a saint and had gone out looking for a good time that ended up turning into a nightmare.",

      "She said she then let him do what he wanted and he had sex with her.",
      "Police investigated the woman\u2019s complaint, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, saying there was insufficient evidence and a conviction was unlikely.",
      "McGregor said the two had sex that was athletic and vigorous, but not rough. He said \u201cshe never said \u2018no\u2019 or stopped\u201d and testified that everything she said was a lie.",
      "\u201cIt is a full blown lie among many lies,\u201d he said when asked about the chokehold allegation. \u201cHow anyone could believe that me, as a prideful person, would highlight my shortcomings.\u201d",
      "McGregor\u2019s lawyer told jurors they had to set aside their animus toward the fighter.",

      "VIENNA\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The U.N. atomic watchdog\u2019s 35-nation\u00a0Board\u00a0of Governors passed a\u00a0resolution\u00a0on Thursday again ordering\u00a0Iran\u00a0to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d report aimed at pressuring\u00a0Iran\u00a0into fresh nuclear\u00a0talks.",
      "Britain, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the\u00a0resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute\u00a0Iranian move to\u00a0cap its stock\u00a0of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said\u00a0Iran\u2019s move was conditional on scrapping the\u00a0resolution.",
      "Iran\u00a0tends to bristle at such\u00a0resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s\u00a0Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced\u00a0IAEA\u00a0oversight.",
      "China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained.",
      "The\u00a0IAEA\u00a0and\u00a0Iran\u00a0have long been locked in standoffs on a\u00a0range of issues\u00a0including\u00a0Tehran\u2019s failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency\u2019s top uranium-enrichment experts on the\u00a0Iran\u00a0inspection team, and its refusal to expand\u00a0IAEA\u00a0monitoring.",
      "The\u00a0resolution\u00a0seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022\u00a0resolution\u00a0that it was \u201cessential and urgent\u201d for\u00a0Iran\u00a0to explain the uranium traces and let the\u00a0IAEA\u00a0take samples as necessary. The\u00a0resolution\u00a0in June of this year did the same.",
      "The new text asked the\u00a0IAEA\u00a0to issue \u201ca comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding\u00a0Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, including a full account of\u00a0Iran\u2019s cooperation with the\u00a0IAEA\u00a0on these issues\u201d.",
      "Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure\u00a0Iran\u00a0into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unraveled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018.",
      "With\u00a0Trump\u00a0due to return to office in January and\u00a0Iran\u00a0having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal\u2019s limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before the 2015 deal\u2019s ones are lifted on \u201ctermination day\u201d in October of next year.",
      "If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called \u201csnapback\u201d, a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed.",
      "Last week\u00a0IAEA\u00a0chief Rafael Grossi\u00a0visited\u00a0Tehran, hoping to convince new\u00a0Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve\u00a0Iran\u2019s cooperation with the agency.",
      "Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that \u201cthe possibility of\u00a0Iran\u00a0not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed\u201d in his meetings with\u00a0Iranian officials, and that the\u00a0IAEA\u00a0had verified\u00a0Iran\u00a0had \u201cbegun implementation of preparatory measures\u201d.",
      "Iran\u00a0already has enough material enriched to that level, close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade, for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an\u00a0IAEA\u00a0yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but\u00a0Iran\u00a0denies seeking nuclear weapons.",
      "Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked\u00a0Iran\u00a0to cap that stock of 60% material and\u00a0Iran\u00a0had accepted his request.",
      "He told a news conference that day that it was \u201ca concrete step in the right direction,\u201d suggesting that he felt a\u00a0resolution\u00a0could undermine that progress.",
      "With the\u00a0resolution\u00a0passed,\u00a0Iran\u00a0is likely to respond.",
      "Moments after the vote,\u00a0Iranian state media cited a joint statement by the foreign ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of\u00a0Iran\u00a0saying\u00a0Iran\u2019s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders for measures like activating various new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium.",
      "\u201cIf there is a\u00a0resolution, it (Iran) will either increase its activities or reduce the agency\u2019s access,\u201d a senior diplomat said before the vote."

    "summary": "Russia did not fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at Ukraine on Thursday, a U.S. official and a military officer with knowledge of the matter told NBC News, disputing a claim by Kyiv.",
    "story": [
      "In a stark warning to Western countries arming Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday he ordered an attack on Ukraine with a new intermediate-range ballistic missile in response to Ukraine\u2019s firing U.S.- and British-supplied longer-range weapons to hit targets inside Russia.",
      "Putin said in a televised address that the strike was a \u201ctest\u201d of a new weapon and that Russia reserved the right to strike at countries that provide weapons to Ukraine for attacks on Russian territory.",
      "Deputy Defense Department press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters that the missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile based on the design of the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile.",
      "\u201cThis was a new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,\u201d Singh said.",
      "Russia notified U.S. officials about the imminent attack, using nuclear risk reduction communication channels, she said. The missile can carry a conventional or a nuclear warhead.",
      "In his speech, Putin warned countries sending weapons to Ukraine that Russia could target them, too.",
      "\u201cWe believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,\u201d Putin said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Russia has plenty of other less-sophisticated weapons that could have hit targets in eastern Ukraine without drawing on its strategic arsenal. By using an intermediate-range missile, a weapon able to strike far beyond Ukraine and can carry a nuclear warhead,\u00a0Moscow was sending a warning signal to Ukraine, Washington and other NATO states, analysts said.",
      "Intermediate-range ballistic missiles have a range of less than 3,500 miles. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, which have a larger range of over 3,500 miles, were developed during the Cold War by both the Soviet Union and the U.S. as part of each side\u2019s nuclear arsenal.",
      "Biden administration officials briefed Ukraine and other allies in recent days about Russia\u2019s possibly using the new weapon to help them prepare, according to a U.S. official.",
      "But the U.S. official said Russia would not be able to bully Ukraine, the U.S. or other countries helping Kyiv fend off invading Russian forces.",
      "\u201cRussia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict,\u201d the U.S. official said.",
      "The administration will continue to send air defense systems, ammunition and other military hardware to Ukraine through the end of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, officials said.",
      "The news comes as Ukrainian forces used their first long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike Russian soil after Washington and its allies lifted restrictions on Kyiv \u2014 a move that Moscow had long warned would be met with a significant response.",
      "Putin this week lowered the bar for his country\u2019s use of a nuclear weapon, a move that Western officials dismissed as the latest instance of Russian saber rattling in the war, which has lasted more than 1,000 days.",
      "'Using Ukraine as a training ground'",
      "Earlier Thursday, Ukraine accused Moscow of launching an ICBM at the eastern city of Dnipro in an overnight attack, which would have been the first recorded use of an ICBM in\u00a0an active conflict\u00a0and the latest escalation by the Kremlin.",
      "But a U.S. official disputed that account, and then Putin himself came out and identified the weapon as an intermediate-range ballistic missile.",
      "Serhii Lysak, the head of the Dnipro regional authority, said on Telegram that two people were injured. Meanwhile, 15 people were injured in a separate attack on the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, local authorities said.",
      "Putin on Tuesday formally revised his country\u2019s nuclear doctrine \u2014 a document detailing the conditions under which Moscow would consider using nuclear weapons \u2014 with the change justifying a nuclear strike by Russia if it were attacked by a nonnuclear country that was supported by a nuclear state.",
      "Ultimately, analysts say, the likelihood of the Kremlin\u2019s opting to use nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine is very slim \u2014 particularly now, when its military is advancing and its opponent is worn down.",
      "Russian forces have seized the momentum in recent months and eked out a succession of territorial gains, particularly on the eastern front lines. They have also been bolstered by thousands of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's troops in their quest to retake occupied land in Russia's Kursk border region.",
      "The West\u2019s relaxing restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons may boost Kyiv, but it is likely do little to transform the battlefield situation, analysts said, despite the dire nature of the Kremlin's rhetorical reaction.",
      "\u201cAt this stage in the war, the risk of Russian nuclear use is lower than before. Political and battlefield developments favor Russia, so there is little to gain by escalating the conflict to the nuclear level,\u201d said Alexander Bollfrass, head of strategy, technology and arms control at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.",
      "In addition to the unclear military benefits of deploying those weapons, there would also be diplomatic drawbacks.",
