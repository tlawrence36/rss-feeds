      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d",
      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d Generational ties also permeate the film adaptation, in which Malcolm Washington follows in his father Denzel Washington\u2019s footsteps in helping to bring the entirety of The Pittsburgh Cycle \u2014 a series of 10 plays \u2014 to the screen.",
      "Malcolm Washington did not start from scratch in his accomplished feature filmmaking debut. He enlisted much of the cast from the recent Broadway revival with Samuel L. Jackson (Doaker Charles), his brother, John David Washington (Boy Willie), Ray Fisher (Lymon) and Michael Potts (Whining Boy). Berniece, played by Danielle Brooks in the play, is now beautifully portrayed by Danielle Deadwyler. With such rich material and a cast for whom it\u2019s second nature, it would be hard, one imagines, to go wrong. Jackson\u2019s own history with the play goes back to its original run in 1987 when he was Boy Willie.",
      "It\u2019s not the simplest thing to make a play feel cinematic, but Malcolm Washington was up to the task. His film opens up the world of the Charles family beyond the living room. In fact, this adaptation, which Washington co-wrote with \u201cMudbound\u201d screenwriter Virgil Williams, goes beyond Wilson\u2019s text and shows us the past and the origins of the intricately engraved piano that\u2019s central to all the fuss. It even opens on a big, action-filled set piece in 1911, during which the piano is stolen from a white family\u2019s home. Another fleshes out Doaker's monologue in which he explains to the uninitiated, Fisher\u2019s Lymon, and the audience, the tortured history of the thing. While it might have been nice to keep the camera on Jackson, such a great, grounding presence throughout, the good news is that he really makes narration shine as well.",
      "Wilson purists will certainly have opinions on these artistic choices; But they let the film breathe a bit, offering some respite from the living room with the looming piano. And most of the film stays right there, in 1936. Boy Willie and Lymon descend early one morning, uninvited, on the Pittsburgh home of Berniece and her uncle Doaker. It\u2019s a family reunion with an agenda: They\u2019ve driven a truck full of watermelons up north from Mississippi, and Willie, Berniece\u2019s younger brother, wants to sell the watermelons and then the piano. The dusty old instrument represents to him a chance to let the past go and start a future. With the money, he wants to buy the land that his enslaved ancestors worked. Berniece has other ideas about the piano, namely keeping it. It\u2019s a connection to the past, not an anchor. Besides, it might be haunted.",
      "Yes, \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d in theaters Friday and streaming on Netflix on Nov. 22, isn\u2019t just a meditation on family history. It\u2019s also a literal ghost story, with creaks, spooks and shadows lurking when the piano is disturbed. Deadwyler is electric as Berniece, who bears the brunt of the haunting, walking on eggshells in her life, trying to care for her young daughter and fend off passes from men who assume she can only be fulfilled with one at her side. Now she must deal with her somewhat manic brother who might, Doaker wisely reminds, actually, annoyingly, have a point. Perhaps the film academy will make up for their snub of her performance in \u201cTill\u201d with this turn.",
      "Regardless of your familiarity with Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle, \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is a worthwhile, captivating and moving watch full of charismatic performers. Talent isn\u2019t always genetic, but the Washington family is putting in the work to prove otherwise. And with \u201cFences,\u201d\u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d and now \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d they\u2019re making a mark with a bold and ambitious project that is probably long overdue. Only seven more to go.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a Netflix release in theaters Friday and streaming Nov. 22, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong language, violent content, some suggestive references and smoking.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "The deal with federal prosecutors was described in a letter partially endorsed by a Manhattan federal judge. It calls for the entertainer to be sentenced to a month in jail, followed by a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfew. He would also be subject to electronic monitoring.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said he will sentence the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez immediately after he admits to the violations at a Nov. 12 hearing. He said he will require each side to explain why a one-month jail sentence followed by three months of home incarceration, detention or curfew are sufficient for repeated violations of probation.",
      "The terms of the deal also call for Tekashi 6ix9ine to submit to supervision from the court's Probation Department for another year.",
      "Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, was within a few months of being free from court supervision when he was arrested on Oct. 29 after his probation officer complained that he wasn't following rules about obtaining permission in advance to travel and that he had failed drug tests.",
      "In 2019, Engelmayer sentenced him to two years in prison in a racketeering case after the musician pleaded guilty that same year to charges accusing him of joining and directing violence by the gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was freed months early from his prison sentence after complaining that his ailments made him particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation's jails and prisons.",
      "Engelmayer, expressing dismay at the artist's apparent failure to follow the rules, noted at a hearing last month that he had granted compassionate release to him during the coronavirus crisis.",
      "The rapper apologized and told the judge he was \u201cnot a bad person.\u201d"

      "British filmmaker Andrea Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments",
      "\u201cIs it too real for ya?\u201d blares in the background of Andrea Arnold\u2019s latest film, \u201cBird,\u201d a 12-year-old Bailey (Nykiya Adams) rides with her shirtless, tattoo-covered dad, Bug (Barry Keoghan), on his electric scooter past scenes of poverty in working-class Kent.",
      "The song\u2019s question \u2014 courtesy of the Irish post-punk band Fontains D.C. \u2014 is an acute one for \u201cBird.\u201d Arnold\u2019s films ( \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d \u201cFish Tank\u201d) are rigorous in their gritty naturalism. Her fiction films \u2014 this is her first in eight years \u2014 tend toward bleak, hand-held verit\u00e9 in rough-and-tumble real-world locations. Her last film, \u201cCow,\u201d documented a mother cow separated from her calf on a dairy farm.",
      "Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments. A dream of something more is tantalizing just out of reach. In \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d peace comes to Star (Sasha Lane) only when she submerges underwater.",
      "In \u201cBird,\u201d though, this sense of otherworldly possibility is made flesh, or at least feathery. After a confusing night, Bailey awakens in a field where she encounters a strange figure in a skirt ( Franz Rogowski ) who arrives, like Mary Poppins, with a gust a wind. His name, he says, is Bird. He has a soft sweetness that doesn\u2019t otherwise exist in Bailey\u2019s hardscrabble and chaotic life.",
      "She\u2019s skeptical of him at first, but he keeps lurking about, hovering gull-like on rooftops. He cranes his neck now and again like he\u2019s watching out for Bailey. And he does watch out for her, helping Bailey through a hard coming of age: the abusive boyfriend (James Nelson-Joyce) of her mother (Jasmine Jobson); her half brother (Jason Buda) slipping into vigilante violence; her father marrying a new girlfriend.",
      "The introduction of surrealism has the ironic effect of breaking the spell that has marked Arnold\u2019s best films. \u201cBird,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is, like the writer-director\u2019s vivid previous work, a movie only she could make. Arnold has described it as the hardest thing she\u2019s ever created, and it\u2019s easy to applaud her for grasping at something in \u201cBird\u201d that ultimately is just out of reach. A resolutely realistic filmmaker turning to magical realism has the uncomfortable effect of making the whole movie, not just the Rogowski bits, feel inauthentic. Instead of being \u201ctoo real for ya,\u201d \u201cBird,\u201d with its in-your-face poverty and narrative extremes, never feels particularly real at all.",
      "The most incongruous parts of \u201cBird,\u201d though, might not be the mysterious avian friend. (Rogowski, a compelling performer, only ever feels half in the movie, as if \u201cBird\u201d can\u2019t quite commit to him being there, either.) Keoghan is a reliably arresting actor who here feels out of place. He doesn\u2019t seem even vaguely fatherly, and while that might be part of the point, too many other things about Bug feel more performative than genuine. There\u2019s his scheme to use hallucinogenic slime from a toad to pay for his wedding, for starters. Add in some karaoke scenes and the sensation creeps in that \u201cBird\u201d is being less compelled by its own story than it is by a pursuit of Arnold\u2019s previous style.",
      "\u201cBird\u201d may go down as a rare miss for Arnold but you can still see the keenness of her eye and the nimbleness of her camera, with her regular cinematographer Robbie Ryan. And that\u2019s true never so much as when the camera is on Adams, a talent, whose melancholy eyes say more than all the theatrics around her.",
      "\u201cBird,\u201d a Mubi release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage throughout, some violent content and drug material.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two stars out of four."

      "On election night 2020, Fox News sparked an internal crisis with a bold call that Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona, putting the Democrat on the path to victory",
      "Four years ago, Fox News precipitated an internal crisis with a bold election night call that President Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona. This year illustrated the difference that four years can make.",
      "Fox News wasn't the first network early on Wednesday to declare Trump had sealed his victory over Kamala Harris \u2014 upstart NewsNation, conservative rival Newsmax and Scripps Networks led the way \u2014 but its ultimate call came nearly four hours before ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The Associated Press made theirs.",
      "Judging by the cheers that erupted when Fox's call was shown to the Trump faithful gathered at his West Palm Beach victory party, it was a decision that surely was received much better by its viewers than the 2020 call was.",
      "\u201cWhen you don't like how the cake tastes, you're not going to like the recipe,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at NewsNation. \u201cWhen you like the cake, you'll love the recipe.\u201d",
      "Fox's Bret Baier called Trump's victory \u201cthe biggest political phoenix from the ashes story that we have ever seen,\u201d and Fox can claim a comeback of its own.",
      "Fox's Arizona call in 2020 infuriated Trump and many of the network's viewers. While it ultimately proved correct, it set in motion furious internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network a staggering $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "NewsNation, which used information from the elections forecasting company Decision Desk HQ, made its call at 1:22 a.m. on Wednesday. Scripps and Newsmax, which also use DDHQ, were within a minute of making the same declaration.",
      "At about that time, Baier said that \u201cwe're not there yet,\u201d but noted there was no path to victory for Harris. Fox made its call at 1:47 a.m.",
      "The AP called the election for Trump at 5:34 a.m. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and the AP all made their calls within a few moments of each other. The AP explained that its declaration that Trump had won came after awarding Wisconsin to the former president by determining that remaining uncounted votes from around the Milwaukee area would not be enough for Harris to overcome Trump's lead there.",
      "For NewsNation's Stirewalt, his network's early call on Wednesday provided a rich irony. He was politics editor at Fox News in 2020 and he and a fellow executive, Bill Sammon, were essentially fired following the outcry over the Arizona call \u2014 even though they were proven right.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to overstate the results and I want to be careful not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say this, it is a victory for the way things used to be done and a personal vindication.\u201d",
      "He said Decision Desk HQ and NewsNation let the numbers do the talking with their calls. He would not criticize rivals for waiting longer, saying it was a natural reaction to be careful in making race calls following what happened in 2020.",
      "The happiness of some viewers at Fox's call was evident in some social media posts. Fox rejects any suggestion that its calls are politically motivated and its decision desk, led by veteran Arnon Mishkin, is widely respected in the industry. Stirewalt called Mishkin \u201csuperb\u201d and said \u201cit is to Fox's credit that they kept him when they didn't keep Bill Sammon and me.\u201d",
      "A vigorous conservative media ecosystem has built up in recent years to compete with Fox. But the network remains king of the hill, illustrated again Wednesday by the Nielsen company's preliminary ratings of television election night coverage.",
      "Fox averaged 9.7 million viewers for its coverage in the prime-time hours, well above second-place ABC News, which had 5.7 million. Newsmax, Fox's chief rival for conservative viewers, had 947,000 viewers and NewsNation had 237,000, Nielsen said.",
      "\u201cI am extremely proud of our team\u2019s commitment to delivering the top reporting and analysis to the largest and most politically diverse audience in news,\u201d Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said of Tuesday night\u2019s ratings, according to the network.",
      "Trump's complicated relationship with the network also attests to its continued influence. The Republican candidate was a regular guest on its shows during the campaign, particularly the morning \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d yet also complains bitterly on social media if he doesn't like something that is said there.",

      "After months of reporting on what polls described as a remarkably close race, news outlets finally have the chance to report on actual results",
      "For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.",
      "Fox News Channel declared Donald Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. \u201cThis is, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\u201d Trump said onstage at his victory party in West Palm Beach.",
      "His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would speak later Wednesday morning, her campaign manager said, dispersing a crowd that had gathered to celebrate her at Howard University.",
      "Broadcast, cable news networks, digital news sites and one streaming service \u2014 Amazon \u2014 covered the count steadily into Wednesday morning. Many of their journalists had warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days, like it had in 2020.",
      "Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. Eastern time, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. The dam broke at 11:18 p.m. on Tuesday, when the AP called the first of seven battleground states, North Carolina, for the former president.",
      "The networks moved quickly into the post-mortem stage.",
      "\u201cThis looks a lot more like 2016 to me than 2020,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said, a reference to Trump\u2019s victory that year over Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
      "Fox News Channel pointed to exit poll results that showed Trump making gains among young voters and Latinos. \u201cThe Biden-Harris people pushed them into Trump\u2019s open arms,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Fox News' Brit Hume said, \u201cit's time for his enemies to stop it.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Trump praised his running mate, JD Vance, for \u201cgoing into the enemy camp\u201d for interviews on places like CNN and MSNBC. \u201cHe absolutely obliterated them,\u201d he said.",
      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",

Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple.

I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",

      "Invited to the stage in Pittsburgh, Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to be the \u201cprotector\u201d of women, and pressed his case on border security and his opposition to transgender athletes participating in sports.",

One suggested that Harris, who is vying to become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected president, began her career as a prostitute.",

      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "After decades in romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- After some difficulties connecting to a Zoom, Hugh Grant eventually opts to just phone instead.",
      "\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologizes. \u201cTech hell.\u201d Grant is no lover of technology. Smart phones, for example, he calls the \u201cdevil\u2019s tinderbox.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re killing us. I hate them,\u201d he says. \u201cI go on long holidays from them, three or four days at at time. Marvelous.\u201d",
      "Hell, and our proximity to it, is a not unrelated topic to Grant\u2019s new film, \u201cHeretic.\u201d In it, two young Mormon missionaries (Chloe East, Sophie Thatcher) come knocking on a door they\u2019ll soon regret visiting. They\u2019re welcomed in by Mr. Reed (Grant), an initially charming man who tests their faith in theological debate, and then, in much worse things.",
      "After decades in romantic comedies, Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career. But in \u201cHeretic,\u201d a horror thriller from A24, Grant\u2019s turn to the dark side reaches a new extreme. The actor who once charmingly stammered in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and who danced to the Pointer Sisters in \u201cLove Actually\u201d is now doing heinous things to young people in a basement.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d Grant says. \u201cI think human beings need challenges. It makes your beer taste better in the evening if you\u2019ve climbed a mountain. He was just so wonderfully (expletive)-up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, co-writers of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d In Grant\u2019s hands, Mr. Reed is a divinely good baddie \u2014 a scholarly creep whose wry monologues pull from a wide range of references, including, fittingly, Radiohead's \u201cCreep.\"",
      "In an interview, Grant spoke about these and other facets of his character, his journey from rom-com idol to horror villain and his abiding affection for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d",
      "GRANT: Yes, thank you. It\u2019s not easy for any actor.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s hard to remember which was the writers, which was me. But I\u2019m pretty sure doing the Jar Jar Binks impersonation was my idea.",
      "GRANT: No, I didn\u2019t. I just thought it would be fun if the character did that because it\u2019d be just weird. And, in fact, what\u2019s odd about me is that I\u2019ve never seen a \"Star Wars\u201d film.",
      "GRANT: I can\u2019t. They\u2019re too frightening for me. I watched \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d when I was too young and I\u2019ve been in counseling ever since. I watched one by mistake recently, which was \u201cMidsommar.\u201d I thought it looked like a jolly, Swedish comedy. I put it on one evening for my Swedish wife who needed cheering up and she\u2019s still very, very traumatized.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s fascinating, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know. Maybe these are the end of times, the end days, the apocalypse. We know it deep down but for some reason we won\u2019t confront it. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s wonderful that it sends people into the cinemas.",
      "GRANT: It is. Talk about the end of days. To me, one of the gloomiest signs or omens is the gradual closing of cinemas \u2014 and not just that, where I live in London, but the closing of bars. The bar where I met my wife, which was party night every night of the week, is now largely closed. I think the fact that we\u2019re all staying in, staring at our devil\u2019s tinderboxes is deeply tragic, or watching things on streaming by ourselves with maybe one or two other family members. These things should be collective experiences.",
      "GRANT: My ability to gauge what\u2019s entertaining, I used to be very proud of it. In the old days, my old career, I used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not so proud of my acting but I\u2019m proud of the fact that the films I\u2019ve done, on the whole, have been entertaining and I\u2019ve been good at choosing them.\u201d And then, suddenly overnight, I became very bad at choosing them. I don\u2019t know, I lost the zeitgeist, I suppose. That can happen. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve found something again. If the character amuses me and I think I\u2019m going to enjoy being that person, then I tend to do the job. Sometimes, when actors are enjoying it, it works.",
      "GRANT: Yes, I\u2019ve got nothing else to go on. And I\u2019m not the lead character, the film doesn\u2019t rest on me. I don\u2019t have to worry that much if it does well, medium or badly. I just go by: Do I think I\u2019m going to have some fun in this?",
      "GRANT: The big shift was after \u201cDid You Hear About the Morgans?\u201d That was sort of officially the end of romantic comedy for me. Nothing much happened after that in showbiz terms. I went off and did political campaigning and I was quite happy, in fact. But in drips and drabs, strange little projects, like the Wachowskis' \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d then Stephen Fears came along with \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d and \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d \u201cPaddington 2.\u201d These interesting, complex, often not very nice, narcissistic weirdos started to emerge from the woods.",
      "GRANT: Looking back, I was very lucky. I had Richard Curtis on the one hand, who is not only a gifted comic writer \u2013 he can just do flat-out comedy like \u201cBlack Adder\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s an unrecognized dramatist. Those comedies are based on pain. The comedy is there to deal with pain. It\u2019s people with unrequited love, lost love, bereavement, brothers with mental illness \u2014 proper pain. So I was lucky with him.",
      "And I think I was very lucky with Marc Lawrence who just had a wonderful gift for the celebration of life. He actually likes people, which is so weird. So films like \u201cMusic and Lyrics\u201d have a very sustaining and uplifting buoyancy to them. He\u2019s an unrecognized talent.",
      "GRANT: You know who really loves them? The most surprising person in the world. Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino pushed his way through a crowd at a party in London once to say, (does Tarantino impression) \u201cMan, I loved \u2018Music and Lyrics\u2019 and \u2018Two Weeks Notice.\u2019\u201d He told me the whole plot of both films and how he was watching one of them on a plane and the plane landed and he had to rush off to a DVD shop to buy the disc so he could watch the end of it. I thought maybe he was joking but I don\u2019t think he was. Someone told me at his cinema here in Hollywood, a rather cool, 35mm-showing theater, he\u2019s been showing \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d no less.",
      "GRANT: Yes, my enthusiasm for that film has spread. I\u2019ve just been invited to a 60th anniversary next year in Salzburg. I might go. I might wear lederhosen. Or I might wear a white dress with a blue satin sash, as I did in school when I played Brigitta Von Trapp.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, I was at all-boys English school and I played, I think, the third youngest daughter.",
      "GRANT: The older I get the more I love song and dance. I find myself watching a lot more Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, things like that. Because life is so stressful and the news is so ghastly that it\u2019s hard to watch very serious stuff and pick yourself up afterwards. I did watch \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d coming over from London the other day. And I have to say that\u2019s just about as good as filmmaking gets. Short of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d obviously.",
      "GRANT: Yes, weirdly it has, and it\u2019s hard to say why. Is it a sort of exorcism or something? I don\u2019t know. Way back in my 20s, when I started out acting, the only thing I thought I could ever bring to entertainment was doing silly characters, doing voices. I did them as a kid to the point where I drove people mad. I was never myself. My parents and my school teachers used to say, \u201cCome on, just drop it. Who\u2019s the real Hugh Grant?\u201d So it was a bit weird to have a career as a leading-man romantic comedies where I didn\u2019t get to be anyone unusual or weird. So I feel like this is something I can do, and quite like doing. At the same time, I learned some tricks of film acting and got a little bit better.",
      "GRANT: The big thing for me was I learned to trust myself a bit more when you\u2019re actually in front of the camera. There\u2019s a terrible danger when people do film acting. They\u2019re so frightened of this big, pressure moment that\u2019s coming up that they sort of pre-rehearse and think, \u201cI\u2019m going to say the line this way, and it\u2019s excellent that way, and I shall just try to reproduce that on the day.\u201d But that\u2019s no good. You\u2019ve got to reinvent it on the day.",
      "The prep work should not be how you\u2019re going to say the lines, the prep work should be \u2014 well, for me, anyway \u2014 a kind of absurdly prolonged in-depth marinade like a piece of old meat that you leave soaking for weeks and months in sauce until it\u2019s full of flavor. So my marinade takes the form of very, very painstaking, minute examination of the script: Why do I say this? Why do I do this? What happened in childhood for this person to behave like this? What was his mother like? What was his father like?",
      "In the case of Mr. Reed in \u201cHeretic,\u201d it\u2019d be: Let\u2019s look at some serial killers. Let\u2019s look at some cult leaders. Let\u2019s look at some atheists. It\u2019s funny how important costume is. Suddenly some thing, one thing, one visual, physical thing makes you go: That\u2019s him. With Mr. Reed it was the idea of double denim. I don\u2019t actually wear double denim in the film but I realized, yes, he\u2019s Mr. Double Denim. He thinks he\u2019s a groovy teacher at university, the one who\u2019s down with the kids, making jokes.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But doing it on those romantic comedies, I\u2019m not sure I really got anywhere particularly. I wasn\u2019t really creating monsters. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re creating monsters. I\u2019m fascinated by the bizarre, weird distortions that human beings twist themselves into emotionally, intellectually, physically from the trials and tribulations of life. I\u2019m not sure that any of my characters in the romantic comedies were sufficiently twisted to fully get my juices flowing.",
      "GRANT: Not necessarily from the point of view of religion. But there is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit. My mother did it. She didn\u2019t like me or my brother being too up and she\u2019d find some way to bring us back to ground level.",
      "GRANT: I agree.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s a very good question that I do not have the answer to. As a matter of fact, there is one thing sitting on my desk in the other room here which is pretty weird and relatively fresh. I agree, I\u2019m not quite sure where to go from here. Maybe it\u2019s song and dance."

      "The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history.",
      "Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution.",
      "\u201cParis C\u0153ur de Lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church\u2019s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping.",
      "\u201cFrom a technological standpoint, it\u2019s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,\u201d director Damien Fontaine explained.",
      "\u201cWe then \u2018unfold\u2019 it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image.

      "Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional. You lose track of what\u2019s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.\u201d",
      "Her historic costume shaped her performance \u2014 literally.",
      "\u201cI have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize there\u2019s a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.",

      "To mark 30 years of his career, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has released a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring previously released and new collaborations across some of his best-known work",
      "NEW YORK -- It's one of the most immediately recognizable voices on the planet: Andrea Bocelli's tenor is beloved across generations, cultures and borders, known to induce tears in as few as three simple words: \u201cCon Te Partir\u00f2,\u201d or in its English performance, \u201cTime to Say Goodbye.\u201d",
      "This year, he's celebrating the 30th anniversary of his career with a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring both previously released and brand-new collaborations of his best-known work \u2014 as well as a few surprising contemporary covers \u2014 and the release of a new concert film, \u201cAndrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration,\u201d which will arrive in theaters on Friday.",
      "So, why duets?",
      "\u201cI've loved voices since when I was a child, and I like very much to share the stage with the best artists and voices. So, this album, there are the best duets that I did in my life,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cFrom the first, \u2018The Prayer\u2019 with Celine Dion, until the last, like \u2018Perfect\u2019 with Ed Sheeran and many, many others. And the album has been remastered and remixed. So, I hope the sound can be better.\"",
      "He says: \u201cThe most important thing in voices... is to be recognizable, to give emotion.\"",
      "Sheeran was an interesting collaboration because when Bocelli first attempted to sing \u201cPerfect,\" the English singer-songwriter wasn't a fan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like what I did because I sang in a pop style,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe wanted to listen to my voice, like in an operatic style.\u201d So, Sheeran traveled to Bocelli's home in Tuscany, and the song was transformed. \u201cHe was right because this song had a huge success.\u201d",
      "When asked if there is anyone he would've loved to add to the \u201cDuets\u201d collection, Bocelli says of course \u2014 but \u201cthey passed away before I began to sing. For example, I would like very much to sing with Maria Callas or (Renata) Tebaldi or Magda Olivero. Many great, incredible singers. They are not anymore with us, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Three decades into his career, Bocelli has performed for presidents, popes, and sold-out stadiums across the globe \u2014 in addition to having sold nearly 90 million records worldwide, according to a press release. \u201cReality exceeded my wildest dreams,\u201d he says.",
      "How he reflects on that time should come as no surprise. \u201cI like to sing to the future. Honestly, I don\u2019t like to think with nostalgia to the past,\" he says. \u201cMy first time on stage, for me it is like yesterday. The time is gone so quickly, so fast. And, yeah, now I like to think to the future.\u201d",
      "So, what, then, does he hope becomes his legacy in the next 30 years, 300 years? \u201cIn Italy, we have a very famous expression: The people that come after us will judge us,\u201d he says with a translator. \u201cSo I can\u2019t force the judge(ment) of the people. But I feel that my audience has a big affection for me, and this is my goal. When somebody in the street comes to me and says (to) me, \u2018Thank you for your voice, for your music,\u2019 I think mission is accomplished.\"",
      "Across \u201cDuets,\u201d Bocelli sings in Italian, English, French and Spanish. \u201cThere are many languages, but it\u2019s so difficult. I remember the day I tried to sing in Chinese, only few lines, but it has been so hard for me,\u201d he laughs.",
      "He also performs across genres, working with everyone from Latin superstars like Karol G and Jennifer Lopez to country musicians like Chris Stapleton and Shania Twain. \u201cI would like to try to sing jazz,\" he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s too difficult for me because you must live in an atmosphere, to learn step by step, day by day. I like jazz but it\u2019s too far from the experience of my life.\u201d",
      "There is little he hasn't done across these last three decades, but the ultimate goal now, he says, is steeped in faith. \u201cI have been very lucky and I reached the affection of the people. Now I must try to deserve the affection of the God. It\u2019s more difficult.\"",
      "But he will continue to perform for those who love him. On Dec. 4, Bocelli's U.S. tour kicks off in San Diego and runs through the month, before commencing again in February and June 2025. The final dates will be held in Napa Valley, California, on June 21 and 22."

      "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
      "Quincy Jones, the multitalented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson\u2019s historic \u201cThriller\u201d album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. Jones was to have received an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and leaving behind a vast musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American song and rhythm. Over the past half century, it was hard to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with Jones\u2019 name on it or someone in the music, television or movie industries who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, singling out any work seems unfair. But honors likely go to his productions with Jackson on \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad,\u201d albums universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination fit perfectly with the bursting talents of Jackson as he sensationally transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019,\u201d Jones and Jackson drew upon disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-defying \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone, helped Jackson become the first major Black artist to have a video played on MTV and influenced countless performers.",
      "\u201cMichael had the look and the voice, and I had every sound you can think of,\u201d Jones would explain.",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d: 28 Grammys (out of 80 nominations), an honorary Academy Award and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur and the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy. In 2001, Jones was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,\u201d and his memoir made him a bestselling author.",
      "\u201cDespite all the Grammys and the special awards and testimonials that maturity bestows, it will always be the values you carry within yourself \u2014 of work, love, and integrity \u2014 that carry the greatest worth, because these are what get you through with your dreams intact, your heart held firm and your spirit ready for another day,\u201d he wrote in his book.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "Music was his passion, and, almost literally, his salvation. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "His survivors include actor Rashida Jones and five other daughters: Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

      "Why did the chicken cross the road",
      "Three clucks to Sy Montgomery, who 14 years after publishing \u201cBirdology,\u201d is still finding ways to make money off the charming stories she told in that book about various avian species. \u201cWhat the Chicken Knows,\u201d subtitled \u201cA New Appreciation of the World\u2019s Most Familiar Bird\u201d was a chapter in \u201cBirdology,\u201d but is being re-released as a mini hardcover.",
      "Readers who haven\u2019t read it will be, briefly, captivated. In just 67 pages (16 of which are glossy color photographs) Montgomery introduces us to her \u201cLadies,\u201d the ever-changing flock of hens she raised on her New Hampshire farm for decades starting in the 1980\u2019s. Blending her personal experiences as queen of the coop with everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about chicken behavior, it\u2019s a fun and informative way to spend an hour.",
      "Here\u2019s a sampling of what you\u2019ll learn: Chickens outnumber people 4:1, they have more in common, anatomically, with dinosaurs than humans, you can mail order up to 350 different varieties of chicks, and roosters really are much meaner than hens.

My life changed forever for the better after meeting him. I had never experienced, nor have since, anyone who\u2019s heart was so filled with love. He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows. He was love lived out loud in human form and he was the first person I ever loved unconditionally. That\u2019s how we signed all our notes to each other, \u201cUnconditionally\u2026\u201d Oprah Winfrey on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cHe was supremely talented, and I felt privileged to have known him for many years. He was friends with George Martin, the Beatles\u2019 producer and, between the two of them, produced some very fine music. Quincy or \u2018Quince\u2019 or \u2018Q\u2019, as he was known, always had a twinkle in his eye and had a very positive, loving spirit which infected everyone who knew him. His work with Michael Jackson is, of course, legendary and he had so many other strings to his musical bow,\u201d Paul McCartney on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \"Quincy is the reason why I decided to become a record producer. His records were my go-to when I started engineering. All of the time that I spent hanging out with him was priceless and I love how open he was- the advice he gave me, the conversations we had have helped me in my life and career. Forever inspired by the incomparable Quincy Jones,\u201d Dr. Dre, on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI was honored to call Quincy a friend. I will always remember his generosity of spirit, his selfless support, and his deep kindness. Our world has lost a giant. But in his melodies, and in the lives he touched, Quincy\u2019s legacy will live on forever,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris, in a statement Monday.",
      "\u2014 \u201cQuincy Jones is the true definition of a Mentor, a Father and a Friend. He pointed me toward the greatest parts of myself. He defended me. He nurtured me. He encouraged me. He inspired me. He checked me when he needed to. He let me use his wings until mine were strong enough to fly,\u201d - Will Smith on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI am speechless at the moment. What this man means to me goes extremely deep. What a life. What an expression of authenticity. What a teacher. I am humbled that I was given the gift of your openness and friendship. I am still processing,\u201d Lenny Kravitz on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cMy fans know how important Quincy was to the fabric of my music. I was given the opportunity to write a foreword to his book and tried to capture what he meant to me as a human. Let\u2019s celebrate his life today,\u201d Abel Tesfaye/The Weeknd on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI woke up today to the Terrible news that we lost Quincy Jones.. Genius is a description loosely used but Rarely deserved. Point blank, Quincy was the MAN. I won my 1st Grammy with Quincy and I live with his Wisdom daily,\u201d Ice-T on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cMy Celestial twin Quincy was a titan in the musical world. He was a wonderful and unique human being, lucky to have known him,\u201d Michael Caine on X (Both Caine and Jones were born March 14, 1933).",
      "\u2014 \u201cQuincy Jones was a musical genius who transformed the soul of America \u2013 one beat, one rhythm, and one rhyme at a time. ... He was a great unifier, who believed deeply in the healing power of music to restore hope and uplift those suffering from hunger, poverty, and violence, in America and the continent of Africa,\u201d President Joe Biden in a statement Monday.",
      "\u2014 \u201cHis music appealed to listeners of every race and every age.

      "The New York Philharmonic is firing principal oboist Liang Wang and associate principal trumpet Matthew Muckey after their union decided not contest the decision, which followed renewed allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse of power.",
      "The orchestra said Monday it issued a notice of non-reengagement to the two effective Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "Wang and Muckey were fired in September 2018 following allegations of misconduct dating to 2010. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians filed a grievance and the two were ordered reinstated in April 2020 by arbitrator Richard I. Bloch. Both men deny any wrongdoing.",
      "New York Magazine in April detailed allegations and the two were placed on paid leave. They then sued the orchestra and the union.",
      "Local 802's executive board said in a nine-page decision issued Tuesday that every member of the orchestra's nine-member dismissal review committee \u201cexpressed revulsion at the abuse of power and pattern of behavior.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic executive adviser Deborah Borda said 11 women made accusations against Wang and three against Muckey during the latest investigation.",
      "\u201cIt found that both gentlemen had been involved in sexual abuse and rape as well as abuse of power,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThis is all new information that came out and I think the reason is that people were afraid to speak up before and they are not now.\u201d",
      "Borda said some of the allegations were made by students.",
      "Steven J. Hyman, a lawyer for Muckey, accused the union of a \"baseless smear campaign, ignoring clear evidence to the contrary.\"",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about potential collusion with the philharmonic in their effort to terminate Matthew Muckey without just cause,\u201d Hyman said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThey reference an alleged encounter from 2008 with a young woman, claiming she did not provide meaningful consent; however, contemporaneous text messages directly contradict this allegation.\u201d",
      "Alan S. Lewis, a lawyer for Wang, called the union's decision \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTroublingly, the philharmonic has gone down the road of public character assassination instead of due process, throwing a lot of mud against the wall to see what sticks,\u201d he wrote Monday in an email to The Associated Press. Lewis described the most serious allegation against Wang involving a person unaffiliated with the orchestra and \"with whom, more than a decade ago, Liang had a long-term consensual relationship.\u201d",
      "He called the other allegations against Wang false.",
      "The philharmonic this spring hired Tracey Levy of Levy Employment Law to investigate and issued a letter of non-re-engagement on Oct. 15 following Levy\u2019s conclusions that the orchestra said were based on new accusations. Muckey said in his lawsuit the New York Magazine story contained \"a reiteration of the same 2010 allegations.\"",
      "The guild's executive committee decision said in Wang's case 11 witnesses \u201ctestified to specific instances of rape, sexual assault, grooming of a young female musician, inappropriate touching and comments, unwelcome kissing, and other sexually harassing behavior.\u201d",
      "The report said a woman six years younger than Muckey testified they \u201chad sex when she was 18 years old and was too incapacitated by alcohol to voluntarily consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the allegations concerning Muckey are not as numerous as those involving Wang, we cannot ignore the fact that they demonstrate a similar abuse of power and failure to acknowledge the importance of a woman\u2019s consent to sexual relations,\u201d the report said.",
      "Under the orchestra\u2019s labor contract, the philharmonic must give notice of a non-reengagement by the Feb. 15 prior to the season in question. The two had the right to contest the decision, which the orchestra said must be \u201cappropriate\u201d under the collective bargaining agreement instead of a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard.",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is not to arbitrate the termination,\u201d local 802 president Sara Cutler wrote in an email to the orchestra members on Monday.",
      "The executive board's unanimous report said it was not determining whether criminal conduct took place but only \u201cwhether the notices of non-reengagement were appropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsidering the 11 witnesses who testified about Wang\u2019s pattern of sexual violence and harassment over many years, we do not credit his denials or failure to remember these events,\u201d the report said. \u201cWith respect to Muckey, we similarly do not find his denials sufficient to overcome the testimony of the witness whom the investigator found credible and the pattern of conduct she described. Additionally, the lack of any contrition and the absence of any empathy shown towards the victims reinforces our view that the dismissal was appropriate.\u201d",
      "The report said two-thirds of the orchestra members had said they would refuse to appear on stage with the two.",
      "Muckey was hired by the orchestra in June 2006 and was given tenure in January 2008. Wang was hired as principal oboe in September 2006.",
      "\u201cThey are barred from the building,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThey will never appear on the stage again with the philharmonic.\u201d"

      "At his own rally in Pittsburgh, which overlapped with Harris' event in the city, the former president criticized Harris for one celebrity endorsement in particular: Beyonc\u00e9. He spoke dismissively about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s appearance at a Harris rally with Harris in Houston last month, drawing boos for the megastar from his supporters.",

      "He insisted his campaign doesn't need celebrities to pack in a crowd, adding: \"We don\u2019t need a star because we have policy. We have great policy.\u201d",
      "At another point in the same rally, though, he enthused: \"So many celebrities here, it\u2019s incredible: Mike Pompeo, please stand up,\u201d introducing his former secretary of state.",
      "Trump also was joined by Megyn Kelly and baseball star Roberto Clemente\u2019s son.",
      "Harris lined up performers to speak and play at campaign rallies in all seven battleground states on Monday, and melded them all into one Democratic get-out-the-vote livestream.",
      "In Las Vegas, performers included Christina Aguilera and electro-dance duo Sofi Tukker. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, took the stage.",
      "In Detroit, performers included Jon Bon Jovi, who sang a quiet acoustic version of his band's working-class anthem \u201cLivin' on a Prayer.\u201d"

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

      "Authorities announced the first case of the new form of mpox in the U.K. last week, saying the case was being treated at a London hospital after recently traveling to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks.",
      "This week, the U.K. Health Security Agency said it had now identified three further cases who lived in the same household as the first patient. They too are now being treated at a hospital in London.",
      "\u201cMpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,\u201d said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August.",
      "Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another type of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that hit more than 100 countries.",
      "The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand.",
      "To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in Congo.",

      "Dr. Thomas Kwan disguised himself as a nurse making home virus booster visits to infect Patrick O\u2019Hara with a flesh-eating poison because he believed the older man stood in the way of him inheriting his mother's home some day.",
      "\u201cIt was an audacious plan to murder a man in plain sight and you very nearly succeeded,\u201d Justice Christina Lambert said. \u201cYou were certainly obsessed by money and more particularly, the money to which you considered yourself entitled.\"",
      "Kwan, 53, pleaded guilty last month in Newcastle Crown Court to attempted murder.",
      "O\u2019Hara, 72, survived after being in intensive care for several weeks and having part of his arm cut away to prevent the necrotizing fasciitis from spreading.",
      "The ordeal left him \u201ca shell of an individual,\u201d he said. O'Hara and Kwan's mother, Jenny Leung, have since split up.",
      "Police used surveillance camera footage to track down Kwan.",
      "They found he had hatched an elaborate plot by sending fake letters with National Health Service logos, hyperlinks and even a QR code to offer a home visit for a COVID booster to O'Hara. Kwan disguised himself in head-to-toe protective gear, tinted glasses and a surgical mask and drove a vehicle to the appointment in January using fake license plates.",
      "Kwan, who was described as having a morbid obsession with poisons, used iodomethane, a substance found in pesticides that he thought would be difficult for medics to detect, the judge said.",
      "Police found arsenic, liquid mercury and castor beans, which can be used to make the chemical weapon ricin, during a search of his home. He had instructions on how to make ricin on his computer.",
      "The judge said Kwan was upset about getting a smaller share of his inheritance when his father died. He had a strained relationship with his mother, and learned that she had a provision in her will that would allow O'Hara to stay in her home if she died before him.",
      "\"Your resentment and bitterness towards your mother and Mr. O\u2019Hara was all to do with money and your belief you were not being given money which you thought you were entitled to,\u201d Lambert said.",
      "O'Hara said justice had been served by the sentence."

    "story": [
      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil is currently \u201cinvaded by illegal websites that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7\u00e3o, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",
      "\u201cWelcome,\u201d one long-time attendee said, in a greeting that has become a regular for the group. \u201cToday, you are the most important person here.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is refusing to say how he voted on Florida's abortion measure \u2014 and getting testy about it.",
      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",
      "The first time he was asked, Trump avoided answering. He said instead of the issue that he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d That was a reference to the former president having appointed three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 2022.",
      "Pressed a second time, Trump snapped at a reporter, saying they \"should just stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump had previously indicated that he would back the measure \u2014 but then changed his mind and said he would vote against it.",
      "In August, Trump said he thought Florida\u2019s ban was a mistake, saying on Fox News Channel, \u201cI think six weeks, you need more time.\u201d But then he said, \u201cat the same time, the Democrats are radical\u201d while repeating false claims he has frequently made about late-term abortions.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",

      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",

      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",

Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Maryland is the first state to sign an agreement with the federal government designed to improve health care and lower costs",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland became the first state on Friday to join a federal program designed to improve health care quality and equity while lowering costs for all health care payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.",
      "It builds on Maryland\u2019s Total Cost of Care Model, which sets a per capita limit on Medicare\u2019s total cost of care in Maryland and encompasses the state\u2019s unique all-payer hospital payment system, which reduces per capita hospital expenditures and supports improved health outcomes, as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act.",
      "This new federal framework, known as the AHEAD model, has been designed to deliver high-quality health care through greater coordination, with a focus on health equity and social needs to support underserved patients.",
      "\u201cThe AHEAD model is the next chapter in health care, so we are proud to be writing that new chapter right here in the state of Maryland,\u201d said Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who signed the agreement with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure.",
      "Since the 1970s, Maryland has had a hospital all-payer system that enables the state to set its own rates for hospital services, and all payers must charge the same rate for services at a given hospital.",
      "It\u2019s designed to provide equitable access to care, eliminate the need for charity hospitals and ensure patients are treated the same regardless of insurance status. State law authorizes the system, which bases costs on rates set by hospitals. It has continued to be the foundation of each subsequent evolution of the Maryland health care model.",
      "\u201cMaryland has this unique system that we\u2019ve developed over a period of decades now,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told reporters after a news conference in Annapolis. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the next level by signing this AHEAD agreement, and the bottom line is it helps us accomplish three top priorities: equity, quality, affordability. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d",
      "The Maryland Department of Health will now begin planning to implement the AHEAD model starting Jan. 1, 2025. That will include establishing targets for cost growth, quality and equity improvements, population health, and primary care investments as well as identifying regional partnerships to drive AHEAD goals.",
      "Sen. Ben Cardin said the agreement keeps in place state policy that health care providers receive the same pay for services, so hospitals have incentives to provide equal care, whether you have private insurance, government insurance, or no insurance.",
      "\u201cSecondly, we are now committed to making sure that we have the most effective quality care,\u201d said Cardin, a Democrat. \u201cSo, we invest in primary care. We invest in early detection, prevention, so that we can keep you healthier, so you don\u2019t have to spend as much time with health care needs.\u201d",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has selected five other states \u2014 Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and regions of New York\u2014 for participation in the AHEAD Model.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s participation in the AHEAD Model is a critical step forward in improving the overall health of its residents, supporting primary care, transforming health care in communities throughout the state, and addressing disparities in the health care system,\u201d Brooks-LaSure said."

      "NEW DELHI -- A thick layer of toxic smog cloaked India\u2019s capital on Friday as smoke from firecrackers used to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, pushed air pollution to hazardous levels.",
      "New Delhi's air quality index plunged into the \u201csevere\u201d category, according to SAFAR, India\u2019s main environmental monitoring agency. In many areas, levels of deadly particulate matter reached seven times the World Health Organization's safety limit.",
      "Authorities in the capital have banned the use and sale of traditional firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for environmentally friendly ones or light shows instead, but the rule is often flouted.",
      "New Delhi, home to more than 33 million people, is regularly ranked one of the most polluted cities in the world.",
      "The air pollution crisis deepens particularly in the winter when the burning of crop residue in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke. That smoke travels to New Delhi, leading to a surge in pollution and worsening the public health crisis.",
      "Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal, which produces most of the country\u2019s electricity, are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas.",
      "\u201cWe may not realize it now, but later we will face lung problems,\u201d said Manoj Kumar, a New Delhi resident who does his morning runs around the capital's iconic India Gate monument.",
      "Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. Tiny particulate matter in polluted air can lodge deep in the lungs and cause a variety of major health problems."

      "QUETTA, Pakistan -- A powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in restive southwest Pakistan on Friday, killing nine people including five nearby children, and wounding 17 other people, officials said.",
      "Local police chief Fateh Mohammad said the attack occurred in Mastung, a district in Balochistan province. He said a motorized rickshaw carrying schoolchildren was nearby when the bombing happened, resulting in the deaths of five children, a police officer and two passersby.",
      "Some of the wounded were moved to a hospital in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department. He said seven people died on the spot, while two men who had been critically wounded died at a hospital.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on police, but suspicion is likely to fall on separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban that have stepped up attacks on security forces and civilians in recent months.",
      "The police chief in Mastung, Rehmat Ullah, said a police van came under attack when it was heading to a health center to escort polio workers for the door-to-door campaign that began on Monday to vaccinate 45 million children under 5, following a surge in new cases.",
      "Pakistan has recorded 41 polio cases across 71 districts so far this year.",
      "The latest attack came days after militants attacked a health center used in the ongoing anti-polio campaign in northwestern district of Orakzai, triggering a shootout that left two policemen dead. Three of the attackers were also killed in the exchange of fire.",
      "Militants in Pakistan often target police and health workers during campaigns against polio, claiming the vaccination drives are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, both denounced the bombing and vowed to continue the war against insurgents until they are eliminated from the country.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and urging the government to investigate and ensure those responsible are brought to justice and held accountable, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",
      "Balochistan is the site of a long-running insurgency, with an array of separatist groups staging attacks mainly on security forces. The groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army, demand independence from the central government.",
      "The BLA has also attacked foreigners. Last month, it claimed responsibility for a bombing that targeted Chinese nationals outside an airport in the southern city of Karachi, killing two workers from China and wounding eight people.",
      "Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects.",

      "Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Thursday expressed her surprise over the ambassador's remarks, saying that Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the seminar, had said \u201cPakistan is committed to providing full security to Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in Pakistan. Our commitment has been conveyed at the senior most levels of the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "She said Jiang's statement was \u201cperplexing in view of the positive diplomatic traditions.\u201d",

      "A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccines to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board",
      "A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccines to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board.",
      "Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department.",
      "While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright.",
      "\u201cI'm not aware of anything else like this,\u201d said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on \u201ca judgment of the medical product itself.\u201d",
      "The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID vaccines in the health district has declined \u2014 with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10.",
      "On Oct. 22, the health department\u2019s board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban \u2014 despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity.",
      "\u201cOur request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those (vaccines), recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. \u201cThis is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \u201ccontagion emergency kits\u201d that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\u201d Aberasturi said. \u201cThis is where we should be stepping in and helping.",
      "\"But we have some board members who have never been there, so they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d",
      "State health officials have said that they \u201crecommend that people consider the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d Idaho health department spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment on \u201cpublic health district business,\u201d but noted that COVID-19 vaccines are still available at community health centers for people who are uninsured.",
      "Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the \u201chealth and well-being\u201d of the district's residents. \"But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.\u201d",

      "Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing.\u201d",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",

      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",

      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

      "\u201cWe want to make this the decade in which we transform the world for good, one solution at a time, from the ground up,\u201d William said in a speech on stage in a giant reusable dome that was put up for the ceremony near Cape Town's harbor.",
      "The Earthshot Prize, which William set up through his Royal Foundation, awarded $1.2 million in grants to five businesses for their sustainable, eco-friendly innovations.

      "Kate has only recently returned to some public duties after treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. Ahead of Wednesday's awards, William told the BBC that Kate was doing \u201creally well\u201d and has been \u201camazing this whole year.\u201d",
      "William has long-standing links to Africa and traveled to the continent as a boy after his mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a car crash in 1997. Kate and William got engaged at a wildlife conservancy in Kenya in 2010.",
      "William met South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the president's Cape Town residence this week and South Africa's second biggest city has paid tribute to the prince's visit by lighting up the face of its iconic Table Mountain in green to recognize his environmental awards.",
      "\u201cAfrica\u2019s been a big part of my life since I\u2019ve been a young boy, since I first came to Africa,\u201d William said. \"Every time I come here I can be myself and get away from all the stuff that happens in my normal life.

      "HONG KONG -- China's exports rose 12.7% in October from a year earlier, the fastest monthly growth in more than two years, according to customs data released Thursday.",
      "The report came a day after former President Donald Trump won Tuesday\u2019s election, gaining a second term as president. Trump has pledged to increase tariffs on imports from China to 60%, adding to uncertainty over the outlook for exports to the U.S.",
      "It showed imports fell 2.3% in October from a year earlier, while China\u2019s trade surplus rose to $95.7 billion in October, up from $81.7 billion in September.",
      "Exports far surpassed analyst\u2019s estimates of about 5.5% growth and outpaced September\u2019s growth of just 2.4%. It was the fastest expansion since July 2022.",
      "The growth in October\u2019s exports signaled sustained demand for Chinese goods abroad, while demand in the domestic market remains subdued.",
      "China\u2019s exports to Russia rose almost 27% from the same time last year, customs data showed, the fastest pace in 11 months. Exports to the U.S. increased by 8% year-on-year, while shipment to the European Union climbed nearly 13%.",

      "\u201cAlthough Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would hurt the export sector, their impact would be less significant than many fear \u2013- we think they could lower export volumes by around 3% \u2013 and may not be felt until the second half of 2025,\u201d Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as U.S. importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs,\u201d Huang said.",

      "The U.S. and Europe recently raised tariffs on China\u2019s exports of electric vehicles and other products, darkening the outlook for China\u2019s trade as an engine of growth. A prolonged slump in the property industry also remains a major drag on the Chinese economy.",
      "Chinese policymakers have already announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including frontloading 200 billion yuan ($28.2 billion) from next year\u2019s budget for spending and construction projects.",
      "In October, China's manufacturing activity expanded for the first time after months of decline."

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",

      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

    "summary": "The Bank of England is set to cut interest rates for the second time in three months as inflation has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England is set to cut interest rates for the second time in three months as inflation has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is set to cut interest rates later Thursday for the second time in three months, as inflation has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "However, economists warn that worries about the future path of prices following last week's tax-raising budget from the new Labour government and the economic impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may limit the number of cuts next year.",
      "For now though, the Bank of England is widely expected to reduce its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75%. In August, the bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee cut borrowing costs for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have recently fallen from multi-decade highs, these central banks started cutting interest rates.",
      "Analysts said that policymakers are likely confident that inflationary pressures in the U.K. economy have eased enough for them to further ease the financial burden on businesses and mortgage holders. In the year to September, inflation stood at 1.7%, its lowest level since April 2021 and below the central bank's target rate of 2%.",
      "The decision comes a month after Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could lead to higher inflation next year.",
      "\u201cThe budget won\u2019t change the bank\u2019s decision to cut rates again .... but it does question our long-held view that rate cuts will speed up from now on,\" said James Smith, an economist at ING.",
      "The rate decision also comes a day after Trump was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, thereby prompting Bank of England policymakers to keep interest rates higher than initially planned.",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to look past the implications of a second Trump presidency when it concludes its latest policy meeting also on Thursday. Like the Bank of England, the Fed is also expected to lower its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point."

      "Germany\u2019s center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced he is firing Finance Minister Christian Lindner, which could undermine the ruling three-party coalition that relies on Lindner\u2019s pro-business party",
      "BERLIN -- Germany\u2019s center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced Wednesday he was firing Finance Minister Christian Lindner, signaling the collapse of the ruling three-party coalition that relied on Lindner\u2019s pro-business party.",
      "Scholz announced the move at a news conference following weeks of disputes among the coalition partners over ways to boost the country's ailing economy. He said he would seek a vote of confidence in January that he said might lead to early elections that otherwise would be due next September.",
      "\u201cI feel compelled to take this step to prevent damage to our country. We need an effective government that has the strength to make the necessary decisions for our country,\" Scholz said.",
      "Lindner, from the pro-business Free Democrats, had rejected tax increases or changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the environmental Greens, who are also part of the coalition, wanted to see massive state investment and rejected the Free Democrats' proposals to cut welfare programs.",
      "Lindner responded to his dismissal by accusing Scholz of failing \"to recognize the need for a new economic awakening in our country. He has played down the economic concerns of the citizens.\u201d",
      "He said the chancellor's proposals to reenergize the economy were \u201cdull, unambitious and make no contribution to overcoming the fundamental weakness of our country\u2019s growth.\u201d",
      "Scholz said about Lindner that \u201che has broken my trust too often. He even unilaterally canceled the agreement on the budget. After we had already agreed on it in long negotiations. There is no basis of trust for further cooperation. Serious government work is not possible like this.\u201d",
      "He accused Lindner of publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what Scholz said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all pensioners. \u201cThat is not decent,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz said he would seek the vote of confidence in Germany's Bundestag, or parliament, on Jan. 15, which would \"allow the members of the Bundestag to decide whether to clear the way for early elections.\u201d The election could then \u201ctake place by the end of March at the latest, in compliance with the deadlines set out in constitution,\" he said.",
      "The regular election is scheduled for September 2025.",
      "Germany\u2019s economy is expected to shrink in 2024 for the second year in a row, or at best stagnate, battered by external shocks and home-grown problems including red tape and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democrats, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck\u2019s environmentalist, left-leaning Greens and Lindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democrats \u2014 a party that in recent decades has mostly allied with conservatives \u2014 set out in 2021 to form an ambitious, progressive coalition straddling ideological divisions that would modernize Germany.",
      "The government can point to achievements: preventing an energy crunch after Russia cut off its gas supplies to Germany, initiating the modernization of the military and a series of social reforms. But the impression it has left with many Germans is of deepening dysfunction.",
      "Ahead of the vote of confidence in January, Scholz said he would reach out to opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the center-right Christian Democrats to confer on possible ways of strengthening the economy and defense.",
      "\u201cI will now very quickly seek talks with the leader of the opposition,\u201d Scholz said. He said he wants to offer Merz the possibility of working together on issues \u201cthat are crucial for our country, on quickly strengthening our economy and our defense.\""

      "Gonz\u00e1lez had 39%, or 438,183 votes with 91% of precincts reporting, according to Puerto Rico\u2019s State Elections Commission.",
      "Coming in second so far was Juan Dalmau, who ran for Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and Citizen Victory Movement. He obtained 33% or 364,145 of votes, making him the first candidate from outside the two main parties in the island to finish second in Puerto Rico\u2019s general election.",
      "No winner has been certified, Jessica Padilla, the commission\u2019s alternate president, said at a news conference early Wednesday.",

      "The Popular Democratic Party, a major party that supports the island\u2019s status as a U.S. territory, was pushed into third place as its candidate Jes\u00fas Manuel Ortiz obtained 21% or 233,470 votes. Meanwhile, Javier Jim\u00e9nez of Project Dignity, a conservative party, obtained 7% of the vote.",
      "The winner will replace Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who was defeated by Gonz\u00e1lez in an upset in a primary election held in June by their New Progressive Party.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be a governor for all Puerto Ricans,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said late Tuesday, promising to represent all those who voted for her, against her or didn't vote at all.",
      "In the race to become Puerto Rico\u2019s new representative in U.S. Congress, Pablo Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez of the Popular Democratic Party was leading. He obtained 46% of the vote compared with 35% for William Villafa\u00f1e of the pro-statehood party, according to partial results.",
      "Dalmau\u2019s strong showing was a sign of a growing body of voters who are giving up on the island\u2019s two established parties.",
      "A growing number of voters old and young have said they were tired of persistent corruption, chronic power outages and a lack of affordable housing, among other things. Their search for new leaders has begun to loosen the hold that the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party had over Puerto Rico\u2019s politics for decades.",
      "Voters like Aisha Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz, 37, said that Tuesday\u2019s election gave them hope that a third-party candidate would win soon.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve already made history,\u201d she said, referring to the alliance between Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "On Tuesday, voters also considered a seventh nonbinding referendum about Puerto Rico\u2019s political status.",
      "It offered three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "Statehood obtained 57% of votes followed by independence with 31%, the first time that option clinched second place. More than 165,000 ballots were left blank, with 91% of precincts reporting.",
      "Regardless of the referendum\u2019s outcome, a change in status requires approval from the U.S. Congress.",

      "The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote but is likely to be challenged in court.",
      "It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members' attacks beforehand or who \u201cexpress support or identification with the act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "They would be deported, either to the Gaza Strip or another location, for a period of 7 to 20 years. The Israel-Hamas war is still raging in Gaza, where tens of thousands have been killed and most of the population has been internally displaced, often multiple times.",
      "It was unclear if it would apply in the occupied West Bank, where Israel already has a longstanding policy of demolishing the family homes of attackers. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years.",
      "Dr. Eran Shamir-Borer, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute and a former international law expert for the Israeli military, said that if the law comes before the Supreme Court, it is likely to be struck down based on previous Israeli cases regarding deportation.",

      "Australia\u2019s highest court has ruled that migrants can\u2019t be forced by law to wear electronic tracking bracelets or to comply with curfews",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s highest court ruled Wednesday that migrants can\u2019t be forced by law to wear electronic tracking bracelets or to comply with curfews.",
      "The ruling is a blow to the government, whose lawyers have unsuccessfully argued that laws imposing curfews and tracking technology are justified to protect the community.",
      "Five of the seven High Court judges ruled that the tough restrictions placed on more than 100 migrants, usually because of their criminal records, were unconstitutional because the conditions amounted to punishment. The constitution states that punishment must be imposed by judges, not lawmakers.",
      "The restrictions were part of emergency laws hastily passed in December in response to another High Court ruling that non-citizens could no longer be detained indefinitely as an alternative to deportation. That ruling in the case of a stateless Rohingya man reversed a 28-year-old High Court precedent that allowed indefinite detention where there were security concerns.",
      "Wednesday's ruling means the government can no longer electronically track the more than 200 non-citizens with criminal records who were released and, for a variety of reasons, couldn\u2019t be deported.",
      "Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said he would introduce legislation to Parliament on Thursday that \u201cwill allow for an adjusted process for electronic monitoring devices and curfews to be used.\u201d He did not detail those adjustments.",
      "\u201cThe court\u2019s decision is not the one the government wanted \u2014 but it is one the government has prepared for,\u201d Burke said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe security and safety of the Australian community will always be the absolute priority for this government,\u201d he added.",
      "The latest High Court case was brought by a 36-year-old stateless man, identified as YBFZ, who was born in Eritrea. His family initially fled to Ethiopia because they feared persecution in their homeland as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and they arrived in Australia as refugees in 2002.",
      "His refugee visa was canceled in 2017 due to convictions including burglary and recklessly causing injury, part of a criminal record that extended for more than a decade. He was held in custody until 2023, when the High Court outlawed indefinite detention.",
      "YBFZ\u2019s lawyer, David Manne, described Wednesday\u2019s verdict as a \u201cmajor victory\u201d for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Australia.",
      "\u201cThis is an important ruling because it underscores the bedrock principle that for everyone, whether citizen or non-citizen, the government does not have the power to punish people by stripping them of their fundamental rights to freedom and dignity,\u201d Manne told reporters.",
      "Opposition lawmakers described the High Court decision as an \u201cembarrassing loss\u201d for the government.",
      "\u201cThe effect of this decision will be that 215 dangerous non-citizen offenders including 12 murderers, 66 sex offenders, 97 people convicted of assault, 15 domestic violence perpetrators and others will be free in the community without any monitoring or curfews,\u201d an opposition statement said.",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil is currently \u201cinvaded by illegal websites that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7\u00e3o, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",

      "South Korea's president has denied wrongdoing over a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol denied wrongdoing Thursday in a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife that\u2019s severely hurting his approval ratings and providing political munition to his rivals.",
      "The political firestorm coincides with South Korea facing a slew of critical foreign policy issues, such as Donald Trump\u2019s election win to become the next president of the United States and North Korea\u2019s reported entry into the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The scandal centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president.",
      "For weeks, the scandal has been making headlines in South Korea as Myung's leaked phone conversations show he boasted of his influence over the presidential couple and other top ruling party officials.",
      "Asked about his ties with Myung during a press conference Thursday, Yoon said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything inappropriate and have nothing to hide regarding Myung Tae-kyun.\u201d",
      "Yoon said he has never meddled in any candidate nomination processes at the PPP, and had never asked Myung to carry out surveys for him, though he acknowledged that Myung gave him some sort of help during his presidential primary campaign in 2021.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Yoon\u2019s statement will ease his festering political strife with his political opponents. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party has demanded he apologize sincerely, reshuffle top officials and accept an independent investigation on his wife.",
      "The Democratic Party recently shared what it said was an audio file of phone calls between Yoon and Myung on May 9, 2022 \u2014 a day before Yoon took office for a single five-year term. The opposition party alleges that the conversation proves Yoon provided Myung with political favors in return for free surveys.",
      "In the audio file, Yoon can be heard telling Myung that he asked a PPP committee to pick senior party member Kim Young-sun to run for one of the parliamentary by-elections the following month. Kim Young-sun eventually obtained the party\u2019s nomination and won the election.",
      "In the file, Myung is heard saying, \u201cI really won\u2019t forget this favor for my entire life. Thank you!\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s election law bars public servants, including the president, from meddling in elections, but has no related clauses on a president-elect, so it's unclear whether Yoon violated the law.",
      "Recent surveys showed Yoon's approval rating fell below 20% for the first time since his inauguration. Kim Keon Hee has been grappling with others scandals, such as spy camera footage purportedly showing her accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor.",
      "Yoon apologized for causing public concerns about him and his wife, but stressed that many of the allegations raised were not consistent with the facts.",
      "Some ruling party lawmakers have accused the Democratic Party of deliberately ramping up political attacks on Yoon and his wife in an effort to rescue its embattled leader, Lee Jae-myung, from legal troubles.",
      "Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, is undergoing four separate trials over corruption and various other allegations. The first two district court rulings on Lee over his election law violation and perjury charges are set for Nov. 15 and Nov. 25. Prison sentences or a fine of more than 1 million won ($750) on the election law case would unseat Lee as a lawmaker and disqualify him from running in elections for five years, although he is likely to appeal any guilty verdict.",
      "Surveys show Lee is the early favorite for the 2027 presidential race to succeed Yoon.",
      "On foreign policy, Yoon \u2014 who has worked closely with Washington and Tokyo to solidify security cooperation in the face of North Korean threats \u2014 expressed optimism that the three-way partnership will continue to expand under Trump\u2019s government. He said he wants to meet Trump and new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba soon to coordinate policies.",
      "During his previous presidency, Trump engaged in highly orchestrated nuclear summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Yoon noted that North Korea\u2019s arsenal has significantly advanced since Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Kim collapsed in 2019 due to disagreements over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.",
      "Yoon said Trump \u201cwill be receiving comprehensive reports very soon about how North Korea\u2019s nuclear technologies and capabilities have changed since then, including assets like reconnaissance satellites that are directly linked to intercontinental ballistic missiles technologies.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter he receives these reports, I think we can have more meaningful and in-depth discussions when we have the opportunity to meet,\" Yoon said.",
      "When asked about concerns that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures, Yoon said Seoul was making \u201cmultifaceted efforts to minimize the losses to our people\u2019s economy.\u201d",

      "A court in Thailand has acquitted a Thai woman who had been charged with involvement in a 2015 bombing at a shrine in Bangkok that killed 20 people and injured 120",
      "BANGKOK -- A court in Thailand on Thursday acquitted a Thai woman who had been charged with involvement in a 2015 bombing at a shrine in Bangkok that killed 20 people and injured 120.",
      "Wanna Suansan was one of three people apprehended out of 17 suspects who authorities said were responsible for the blast at Erawan Shrine, a popular tourist destination, particularly for visitors from China. The Bangkok Southern Criminal Court ruled that there was not enough evidence to link her to the bombing.",
      "The two others being tried separately are ethnic Uyghurs, a Muslim minority in China that has suffered repression. All three were charged with a variety of offenses, including murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of explosive materials.",
      "The two Uyghurs were arrested in 2015 shortly after the bombing on Aug. 17. Wanna was arrested later when she voluntarily returned to Thailand from Turkey in 2017 to turn herself in when she was named as a suspect.",
      "Thai authorities have said the bombing was revenge by a people-smuggling gang whose activities had been disrupted by the police. Thailand cracked down on human traffickers earlier in 2015 after abandoned camps for Rohingyas fleeing persecution in Myanmar and economic migrants from Bangladesh were found in the jungles along the Thai-Malaysia border.",
      "However, some analysts suspect the bombing was the work of Uyghur separatists angry that Thailand had forcibly repatriated scores of Uyghurs to China in July that year. Many Uyghurs try to escape persecution and tight control in China with the help of professional smugglers. The shrine\u2019s popularity among Chinese tourists lent support to the theory that the bombing had a political element.",
      "While the two other suspects, Yusufu Mieraili and Bilal Mohammad, were allegedly linked by video, DNA and other evidence to the bombing, the case against Wanna was more circumstantial.",
      "Wanna, 36, was accused of leasing accommodation for the alleged bombers. Police said they found gunpowder, fertilizer and other bomb-making materials in an apartment in outer Bangkok that was leased under Wanna\u2019s name.",
      "The judge on Thursday said there was not enough evidence indicating that Wanna had committed a crime as she was charged.",
      "She said prosecutors could not provide evidence that Wanna was present at the site of the bombing, had brought the other suspects there or helped them escape. There was also no evidence that she had contact with them or helped them acquire explosive materials that were found in the apartment, which she was alleged to have rented for the suspects, the judge said.",
      "She said it might have been possible that Wanna helped find accommodation for friends or acquaintances of her husband, who is Turkish, but prosecutors could not prove what kind of relationship her husband might have had with the other suspects. Her husband, not in custody, is another suspect in the case.",
      "Some of the suspects are Turks, with whom Uyghurs share ethnic bonds.",
      "\u201cToday the court acquitted the charges. I\u2019m very happy. I\u2019d like to thank the court, because I had been waiting for this day for seven years since I returned,\u201d Wanna said after the ruling.",
      "She said that during that time, she felt discouraged because \"it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t get any justice, and it also damaged my family.\u201d",
      "Mieraili and Bilal, accused of being the main bombers, have faced repeated delays in their trial because of difficulties in finding suitable translators. Their lawyer, Chuchart Kanpai, said Thursday that their case was still at the stage of examining witnesses, and the next court date is scheduled for March.",
      "The two men pleaded not guilty when their trial began in 2016 and said they suffered mistreatment and torture in jail after their arrests. Police said they believe Mieraili detonated the bomb minutes after a backpack containing the device was allegedly left at the shrine by Bilal, who is also known as Adem Karadag."

      "Germany\u2019s leader is expected to lead the country with a minority government after the collapse of the coalition",
      "BERLIN -- After German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats in a late-night move after a marathon of crisis meetings, the three remaining ministers of the Free Democrats also resigned later at night effectively leading to the government coalition's collapse.",
      "However, in another unexpected turn of events, Transport Minister Volker Wissing from the Free Democrats took back last night's resignation and told reporters on Thursday morning in Berlin that after talking to Scholz, he had decided to stay on as minister and leave the party instead.",
      "Lindner will receive his certificate of dismissal from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday afternoon and, to ensure a smooth transition, a successor will likely be named right after. The posts of the research and justice ministers who resigned may also be filled Thursday, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "Scholz announced late Wednesday that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that he said might lead to an early election as soon as March \u2014 which otherwise would have been be due next September.",
      "Scholz had accused Lindner of breaching his trust and publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all retirees.",
      "\u201cThat is not decent,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz's left-leaning Social Democrats will now effectively lead a minority government with the remaining coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens.",
      "The chancellor announced late Wednesday that he would reach out to the leader of the biggest opposition leader in parliament, Friedrich Merz from the center-right Christian Democrats, to confer on possible ways of strengthening the economy and defense, and passing important legislation through parliament.",
      "But Merz on Thursday morning vehemently rejected Scholz's plan to wait to hold a vote of confidence until January.",
      "\u201cThe coalition no longer has a majority in the German Bundestag, and we therefore call on the chancellor (...) to call a vote of confidence immediately, or at the latest by the beginning of next week.\u201d",
      "Merz said that an early election could then be held as soon as January.",
      "\u201cWe simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months now, and then campaign for several more months, and then possibly conduct coalition negotiations for several weeks,\" Merz added.",
      "Indeed, pushing through new legislation and plugging the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget won\u2019t become easier for Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the Greens as their government no longer has a majority in parliament.",
      "The collapse of the coalition came after weeks of disputes among the coalition partners over ways to boost the country\u2019s ailing economy.",
      "Lindner's pro-business Free Democrats had rejected tax increases or changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the Greens wanted to see major state investment and rejected the Free Democrats\u2019 proposals to cut welfare programs."

      "U.S. stocks stormed to records as investors made bets on what Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, banks and bitcoin all stormed higher Wednesday as investors made bets on what Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation.",
      "The S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks.",
      "The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean.",
      "\u201cThe markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,\u201d Peter Esho of Esho Capital said.",
      "Of course, how much change Trump effects in his second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that\u2019s still to be determined. That could leave room for snaps back in some of Wednesday\u2019s big knee-jerk movements.",
      "Nevertheless, the market is cleaving between rather clear winners and losers following Trump\u2019s dramatic win. Among them:",
      "Bank stocks led the market higher, in part on hopes that a stronger economy would mean more customers getting loans and paying them back with interest. They also rallied on hopes for lighter regulation from a Republican White House. JPMorgan Chase soared 11.5%, and financial stocks had the biggest gain by far among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market's biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump.",
      "Trump has pledged to make the country \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase\u2019s 31.1% leap.",
      "Musk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president\u2019s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%.",
      "The company behind Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump\u2019s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier.",
      "A Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation\u2019s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%.",
      "Trump\u2019s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500\u2019s gain.",
      "Investors see Trump\u2019s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government\u2019s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It\u2019s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%.",
      "Investors also see Trump\u2019s policies likely adding to future inflation, particularly tariffs, which can add costs to U.S. households\u2019 bills.",
      "\u201cTrump keeps openly telling people that he will increase tariffs not just on China but with every trade partner,\u201d said Andrzej Skiba, head of BlueBay U.S. Fixed Income at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re talking 10% tariffs across all global partners. This is a big deal because this could add 1% to inflation. If you add 1% to next year\u2019s inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts.\u201d",
      "A drop-off in immigration could also mean a crunch of available workers for employers, which could force companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on inflation.",
      "Much of Wall Street\u2019s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, now that inflation seems to be heading back down to its 2% target. Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "The Fed will announce its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, where the expectation is still for a cut, according to data from CME Group. But traders are already paring back forecasts for how many cuts the Fed will provide through the middle of next year.",
      "Trump has vowed to sharply hike tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries, raising worries about trade wars and disruptions to the global economy. A measure of the U.S. dollar\u2019s value against several major currencies climbed 1.6%, which means that those other currencies fell.",
      "The euro sank 1.5%, and the South Korean won fell 1.2% The Mexican peso, which has been falling against the dollar since the summer, in part on worries about a possible Trump re-election, fell early in the day but then pared its loss.",
      "Trump is a fan of fossil fuels, encouraging production of oil and natural gas. His win sent solar stocks sharply lower, including a 10.1% fall for First Solar and 16.8% slide for Enphase Energy.",
      "The only stock with a bigger loss in the S&P 500 was Super Micro Computer, which said its sales for the latest quarter could come in below its prior forecast. Its stock sank 18.1%.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 146.28 points to 5,929.04. The Dow surged 1,508.05 to 43,729.93, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 544.29 to 18,983.47.",

      "On election night 2020, Fox News sparked an internal crisis with a bold call that Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona, putting the Democrat on the path to victory",
      "Four years ago, Fox News precipitated an internal crisis with a bold election night call that President Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona. This year illustrated the difference that four years can make.",
      "Fox News wasn't the first network early on Wednesday to declare Trump had sealed his victory over Kamala Harris \u2014 upstart NewsNation, conservative rival Newsmax and Scripps Networks led the way \u2014 but its ultimate call came nearly four hours before ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The Associated Press made theirs.",
      "Judging by the cheers that erupted when Fox's call was shown to the Trump faithful gathered at his West Palm Beach victory party, it was a decision that surely was received much better by its viewers than the 2020 call was.",
      "\u201cWhen you don't like how the cake tastes, you're not going to like the recipe,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at NewsNation. \u201cWhen you like the cake, you'll love the recipe.\u201d",
      "Fox's Bret Baier called Trump's victory \u201cthe biggest political phoenix from the ashes story that we have ever seen,\u201d and Fox can claim a comeback of its own.",
      "Fox's Arizona call in 2020 infuriated Trump and many of the network's viewers. While it ultimately proved correct, it set in motion furious internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network a staggering $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "NewsNation, which used information from the elections forecasting company Decision Desk HQ, made its call at 1:22 a.m. on Wednesday. Scripps and Newsmax, which also use DDHQ, were within a minute of making the same declaration.",
      "At about that time, Baier said that \u201cwe're not there yet,\u201d but noted there was no path to victory for Harris. Fox made its call at 1:47 a.m.",
      "The AP called the election for Trump at 5:34 a.m. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and the AP all made their calls within a few moments of each other. The AP explained that its declaration that Trump had won came after awarding Wisconsin to the former president by determining that remaining uncounted votes from around the Milwaukee area would not be enough for Harris to overcome Trump's lead there.",
      "For NewsNation's Stirewalt, his network's early call on Wednesday provided a rich irony. He was politics editor at Fox News in 2020 and he and a fellow executive, Bill Sammon, were essentially fired following the outcry over the Arizona call \u2014 even though they were proven right.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to overstate the results and I want to be careful not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say this, it is a victory for the way things used to be done and a personal vindication.\u201d",
      "He said Decision Desk HQ and NewsNation let the numbers do the talking with their calls. He would not criticize rivals for waiting longer, saying it was a natural reaction to be careful in making race calls following what happened in 2020.",
      "The happiness of some viewers at Fox's call was evident in some social media posts. Fox rejects any suggestion that its calls are politically motivated and its decision desk, led by veteran Arnon Mishkin, is widely respected in the industry. Stirewalt called Mishkin \u201csuperb\u201d and said \u201cit is to Fox's credit that they kept him when they didn't keep Bill Sammon and me.\u201d",
      "A vigorous conservative media ecosystem has built up in recent years to compete with Fox. But the network remains king of the hill, illustrated again Wednesday by the Nielsen company's preliminary ratings of television election night coverage.",
      "Fox averaged 9.7 million viewers for its coverage in the prime-time hours, well above second-place ABC News, which had 5.7 million. Newsmax, Fox's chief rival for conservative viewers, had 947,000 viewers and NewsNation had 237,000, Nielsen said.",
      "\u201cI am extremely proud of our team\u2019s commitment to delivering the top reporting and analysis to the largest and most politically diverse audience in news,\u201d Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said of Tuesday night\u2019s ratings, according to the network.",
      "Trump's complicated relationship with the network also attests to its continued influence. The Republican candidate was a regular guest on its shows during the campaign, particularly the morning \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d yet also complains bitterly on social media if he doesn't like something that is said there.",

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a case of Beyond Me just decided to become a niche brand going after affluent customers,\u201d Brown said on a conference call with investors. \u201cIt\u2019s much more diverse than that, much more nuanced than that in our pricing.\u201d",
      "Beyond Meat said its U.S. retail volume in terms of pounds sold fell 6.6% in the third quarter but food service sales were up nearly 8%. Food service sales benefited from an expansion of Beyond Meat sales at Panda Express during the quarter.",
      "Outside the U.S., that pattern reversed; Beyond Meat's international retail sales were up 6% but its food service sales dropped 22%. Brown said Beyond Meat began selling its products at German retailers after working to meet their shelf-life requirements. It also launched plant-based nuggets at 1,500 McDonald's stores in France, although it saw lower sales in some other European markets.",
      "Beyond Meat said it narrowed its net loss to $26.6 million for the quarter, compared to $70.5 million in the third quarter a year ago. That loss, of 41 cents per share, also beat analysts' forecast of a 48-cent loss.",
      "Brown said the company has made substantial progress on cutting its costs and consolidating its operations. He noted that Beyond Meat hit its lowest cost-per-pound in the third quarter since 2021."

      "HONG KONG -- China's exports rose 12.7% in October from a year earlier, the fastest monthly growth in more than two years, according to customs data released Thursday.",
      "The report came a day after former President Donald Trump won Tuesday\u2019s election, gaining a second term as president. Trump has pledged to increase tariffs on imports from China to 60%, adding to uncertainty over the outlook for exports to the U.S.",
      "It showed imports fell 2.3% in October from a year earlier, while China\u2019s trade surplus rose to $95.7 billion in October, up from $81.7 billion in September.",

      "The growth in October\u2019s exports signaled sustained demand for Chinese goods abroad, while demand in the domestic market remains subdued.",
      "China\u2019s exports to Russia rose almost 27% from the same time last year, customs data showed, the fastest pace in 11 months. Exports to the U.S. increased by 8% year-on-year, while shipment to the European Union climbed nearly 13%.",
      "China\u2019s exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2014 China's largest trading partner by region \u2014 jumped 16%.",

      "\u201cAlthough Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would hurt the export sector, their impact would be less significant than many fear \u2013- we think they could lower export volumes by around 3% \u2013 and may not be felt until the second half of 2025,\u201d Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",

      "Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential electi...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump's presidential election victory.",
      "Yet the Fed's future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump's economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary. His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed's policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank's interest rate decisions.",
      "The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again.",
      "The economy is also clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Even so, consumer spending has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation.",
      "Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed's half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting.",
      "The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate, for example, fell over the summer as the Fed signaled that it would cut rates, only to rise again once the central bank actually cut its benchmark rate.",
      "Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump. In what Wall Street has called the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d stock prices also soared Wednesday and the value of bitcoin and the dollar surged. Trump had talked up cryptocurrencies during his campaign, and the dollar would likely benefit from higher rates and from the across-the-board increase in tariffs that Trump has proposed.",
      "Trump's plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank's preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump's proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026.",
      "Such an increase would likely upend the future rate cuts the Fed had signaled in September. At that meeting, when the policymakers cut their key rate by an outsize half-point to about 4.9%, the officials said they envisioned two quarter-point rate reductions later in the year \u2014 one on Thursday and one in December \u2014 and then four additional rate cuts in 2025.",
      "But investors now foresee rate cuts next year as increasingly unlikely. The perceived probability of a rate cut at the Fed's meeting in January of next year fell Wednesday to just 28%, down from 41% on Tuesday and from nearly 70% a month ago, according to futures prices monitored by CME FedWatch.",
      "The jump in borrowing costs for things like mortgages and car loans, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates.",
      "The economy grew at a solid annual rate of just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending \u2014 fueled by higher-income shoppers \u2014 rose strongly in the July-September quarter.",
      "At the same time, companies have reined in hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. But if economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its interest rate cuts."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts.",
      "When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target.",
      "These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.",
      "Here are some of the measures.",
      "This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming years.",
      "It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty. One major way it does so is by giving credits to businessespeople who build new solar and wind farms.",
      "But it's not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as long as they don't earn too much to qualify.",
      "Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats\u2019 \u201cgreen new scam\u201d in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change.",
      "He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the landmark 2022 climate law.",
      "If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing, because it is perceived as \u201cAmerica first and pro-U.S. business,\u201d said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he added.",
      "In a call Wednesday morning, Scott Segal, head of a communications group at the law firm Bracewell LLP, which represents the energy industry, said the climate law is not likely to be repealed.",
      "Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown, said repealing parts of the climate law could backfire because most of the investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts.",
      "The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing the climate change that comes from making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard said.",
      "It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-controlled states have filed legal challenges to a host of EPA rules including this one and Trump\u2019s victory means the Justice Department is unlikely to defend it.",
      "Under a Trump presidency, it is unlikely to survive, Shepheard said.",
      "The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "\u201cI hope that we don\u2019t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the climate. It\u2019s about our lives and our health.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger hurricanes \u2014 methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too expensive to transport.",
      "The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-leaning states have challenged the rule in court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards.",
      "The EPA said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks under the Biden administration.",
      "While it is unclear who will head the EPA under Trump, the agency is considered likely to begin a lengthy process to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle \u201cmandate.\u2033 Trump rolled back more than 100 environmental laws as president and that number is likely to grow in a second term.",
      "Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don\u2019t work in cold weather and aren\u2019t able to travel long distances. Trump softened his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.",
      "Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars.",
      "Trump is almost certain to reinstate oil drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears, caribou and other wildlife. Trump opened the area to drilling in a 2017 tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. No drilling has occurred in the refuge, although the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday proposed a lease sale by the end of December that could lead to oil drilling. The sale is required under the 2017 law.",
      "Trump, who has cast climate change as a \u201choax,\u201d has said he will also eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.",
      "Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate action will continue to move forward at the state and local level.",
      "Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the federal level on climate, she\u2019s optimistic that states including California will continue to lead.",
      "Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said on Wednesday that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record installations of wind and solar energy.",
      "Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said.",
      "Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden\u2019s first national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power.",
      "\u201cNo matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,\u2033 McCarthy said. Advocates for clean energy are bipartisan, well-organized \u201cand fully prepared to deliver climate solutions, boost local economies, and drive climate ambition,\u2032 she said.",

      "A man charged with fraud for claiming to own a storied Manhattan hotel where he had been living rent-free for years has been found unfit to stand trial",
      "NEW YORK -- A man charged with fraud for claiming to own a storied Manhattan hotel where he had been living rent-free for years has been found unfit to stand trial, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "Doctors examining Mickey Barreto deemed he's not mentally competent to face criminal charges, and prosecutors confirmed the results during a court hearing Wednesday, according to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.",
      "Judge Cori Weston gave Barreto until Nov. 13. to find suitable inpatient psychiatric care, Bragg's office said.",
      "Barreto had been receiving outpatient treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues, but doctors concluded after a recent evaluation that he did not fully understand the criminal proceedings, the New York Times first reported.",
      "Barreto dismissed the allegations of a drug problem to some \u201cpartying,\u201d and said prosecutors are trying to have him hospitalized because they did not have a strong case against him. He does see some upside.",
      "\u201cIt went from being unfriendly, \u2018He\u2019s a criminal,\u2019 to oh, they don\u2019t talk about crime anymore. Now the main thing is, like, \u2018Oh, poor thing. Finally, we convinced him to go seek treatment,\u2019\u201d Barreto told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "Brian Hutchinson, an attorney for Barreto, didn't immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. But during Wednesday's hearing, he said he planned to ask his client's current treatment provider to accept him, the Times reported.",
      "In February, prosecutors charged Barreto with 24 counts, including felony fraud and criminal contempt.",
      "They say he forged a deed to the New Yorker Hotel purporting to transfer ownership of the entire building to him.",
      "He then tried to charge one of the hotel's tenants rent and demanded the hotel\u2019s bank transfer its accounts to him, among other steps.",
      "Barreto started living at the hotel in 2018 after arguing in court that he had paid about $200 for a one-night stay and therefore had tenant\u2019s rights, based on a quirk of the city's housing laws and the fact that the hotel failed to send a lawyer to a key hearing.",
      "Barreto has said he lived at the hotel without paying any rent because the building\u2019s owners, the Unification Church, never wanted to negotiate a lease with him, but they also couldn\u2019t legally kick him out.",
      "Now, his criminal case may be steering him toward a sort of loophole.",
      "\u201cSo if you ask me if it\u2019s a better thing, in a way it is. Because I\u2019m not being treated as a criminal but I\u2019m treated like a nutjob,\u201d Barreto told the AP.",
      "Built in 1930, the hulking Art Deco structure and its huge red \u201cNew Yorker\u201d sign is an oft-photographed landmark in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Muhammad Ali and other famous boxers stayed there when they had bouts at nearby Madison Square Garden, about a block away. Inventor Nikola Tesla even lived in one of its more than 1,000 rooms for a decade. And NBC broadcasted from its Terrace Room.",
      "But the New Yorker closed as a hotel in 1972 and was used for years for church purposes before part of the building reopened as a hotel in 1994."

    "story": [
      "The Bank of England is set to cut interest rates for the second time in three months as inflation has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is set to cut interest rates later Thursday for the second time in three months, as inflation has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "However, economists warn that worries about the future path of prices following last week's tax-raising budget from the new Labour government and the economic impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may limit the number of cuts next year.",
      "For now though, the Bank of England is widely expected to reduce its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75%. In August, the bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee cut borrowing costs for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have recently fallen from multi-decade highs, these central banks started cutting interest rates.",
      "Analysts said that policymakers are likely confident that inflationary pressures in the U.K. economy have eased enough for them to further ease the financial burden on businesses and mortgage holders. In the year to September, inflation stood at 1.7%, its lowest level since April 2021 and below the central bank's target rate of 2%.",
      "The decision comes a month after Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could lead to higher inflation next year.",
      "\u201cThe budget won\u2019t change the bank\u2019s decision to cut rates again .... but it does question our long-held view that rate cuts will speed up from now on,\" said James Smith, an economist at ING.",
      "The rate decision also comes a day after Trump was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, thereby prompting Bank of England policymakers to keep interest rates higher than initially planned.",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to look past the implications of a second Trump presidency when it concludes its latest policy meeting also on Thursday. Like the Bank of England, the Fed is also expected to lower its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point."

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A jury could begin deliberations as soon as Thursday on whether a Virginia-based military contractor bears responsibility for the abuse of detainees 20 years ago at Iraq's infamous Abu Ghraib prison.",
      "The civil trial underway in U.S. District Court in Alexandria is the second this year involving allegations against Reston-based CACI, which supplied civilian interrogators to Abu Ghraib in 2003 and 2004 to supplement U.S. military efforts after the invasion of Iraq.",
      "The first trial earlier this year ended in a mistrial with a hung jury that could not agree on whether CACI was liable.",
      "The prison abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib shocked the world's conscience two decades ago after photos became public showing naked, abused inmates forced into humiliating poses.",
      "Military police who were seen in the photos smiling and laughing as they directed the abuse were convicted in military courts-martial. But none of the civilian interrogators from CACI ever faced criminal charges, even though military investigations concluded that several CACI interrogators had engaged in wrongdoing.",
      "The current lawsuit, filed by three former Abu Ghraib detainees, alleges that CACI interrogators contributed to their mistreatment by conspiring with military police to \u201csoften up\u201d detainees for questioning by subjecting them to abuse that included beatings, sexual abuse, forced nudity and dog attacks.",
      "The trial earlier this year was the first time a U.S. jury heard claims brought by Abu Ghraib survivors. It came after 15 years of legal wrangling and multiple appeals that saw the case thrown out, only to be revived on multiple occasions by a federal appeals court.",
      "CACI maintains, as it has from the outset, that it did nothing wrong. It does not deny that some detainees were horribly mistreated, though it has sought to cast doubt on whether the three plaintiffs in this case have been truthful about the specific abuse they have claimed.",
      "But CACI says its employees had nothing to do with the abuse. And they contend that any isolated misconduct by its employees is actually the responsibility of the Army, which CACI contends had complete supervision and control over the civilians it supplied to the war effort.",
      "CACI sought again this week to have the case tossed out of court, arguing in its filings that the plaintiffs \u201chave not presented evidence, nor maintain any claims that CACI personnel directly mistreated them. Instead, Plaintiffs seek to hold CACI vicariously liable for injuries inflicted by others.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs have said that CACI's contract with the Army, as well as the Army Field Manual, make clear that CACI is responsible for overseeing its own workers.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, though, has allowed the case to go forward. Closing arguments are expected on Thursday."

      "Germany\u2019s leader is expected to lead the country with a minority government after the collapse of the coalition",
      "BERLIN -- After German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats in a late-night move after a marathon of crisis meetings, the three remaining ministers of the Free Democrats also resigned later at night effectively leading to the government coalition's collapse.",
      "However, in another unexpected turn of events, Transport Minister Volker Wissing from the Free Democrats took back last night's resignation and told reporters on Thursday morning in Berlin that after talking to Scholz, he had decided to stay on as minister and leave the party instead.",
      "Lindner will receive his certificate of dismissal from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday afternoon and, to ensure a smooth transition, a successor will likely be named right after. The posts of the research and justice ministers who resigned may also be filled Thursday, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "Scholz announced late Wednesday that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that he said might lead to an early election as soon as March \u2014 which otherwise would have been be due next September.",
      "Scholz had accused Lindner of breaching his trust and publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all retirees.",
      "\u201cThat is not decent,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz's left-leaning Social Democrats will now effectively lead a minority government with the remaining coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens.",

      "Norfolk Southern sparked renewed concerns about flaws being missed during railcar inspections when it told employees this week they should spend no more than a minute looking at each car",
      "Norfolk Southern sparked renewed concerns about flaws being missed during railcar inspections when it told employees this week they should spend no more than a minute looking at each car. But the railroad said the rule simply reflects the current industry standard, and there are no plans for disciplining employees for missing that one-minute target.",
      "Rail unions have been raising the alarm for several years now about inspections being rushed across the industry in the wake of the railroads eliminating one-third of all the jobs as they adopted the current lean operating model that has become the standard.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration's Chief Safety Officer Karl Alexy said the agency was already tracking inspection times closely across the industry before the new announcement from Norfolk Southern, and the agency will be watching how the railroad implements it.",
      "\u201cIf they really are going to be held to that, I'm very concerned about defects not being found, I think that is pretty quick,\u201d Alexy said.",
      "Railroad safety concerns became widespread last year after a Norfolk Southern train derailed, spilled hazardous chemicals and caught fire in East Palestine, Ohio, in February.",
      "The railroad \u2014 and the entire industry \u2014 promised reforms after that disastrous wreck. But Alexy said there hasn't been much significant improvement in railroads' overall safety record in recent years.",
      "The concerns about rushed railcar inspections are part of rail labor\u2019s broader concerns about whether the lean Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) model railroads are using is more dangerous.",
      "Alexy said that one of the key challenges for the industry right now is that so many experienced workers were lost because of all the job cuts in recent years \u2014 both because of the new operating model and the sharp downturn in business during the pandemic \u2014 that the railroads are relying on a large number of newer employees who are still learning all the risks of the job.",
      "\u201cThere are implications from PSR where they they cut too deep their personnel. And Covid happened and they lost more people, and then they had a hard time bringing them back,\u201d Alexy said. \u201cSo I think that there have been some long-term negative impacts of PSR and of course Covid as well.\u201d",
      "Norfolk Southern executives said last year that the railroad would back away from rushing inspections because of safety concerns. But the new directive about minute-long inspections issued not long after Mark George was promoted to be the railroad's new CEO this fall appears to reverse that stance.",
      "Norfolk Southern is not alone in pushing for inspections to be done quickly to keep trains moving.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration found earlier this year that at all the major freight railroads, carmen spent an average of 1 minute and 38 seconds looking over each car while a federal inspector was watching. But documents showed that when an inspector isn\u2019t there, inspections were being done in about 44 seconds per car.",
      "The Transportation Communications Union that represents the carmen tasked with inspecting railcars maintains it simply isn't possible to check the more than 90 points per side they are supposed to check on each railcar within such a short period of time, so clearly things are being missed.",
      "The union's National Legislative Director David Arouca said carmen on Norfolk Southern went \u201cabsolutely ballistic\u201d when they saw the new one-minute rule after they have been raising concerns about the perils of rushed inspections for years.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t place your eyeballs on 90 points of inspection in 30 seconds (per side) and do that repeatedly for 50-100 cars in a row and not miss things,\u201d Arouca said.",
      "That is especially true when carmen are inspecting cars that might have been in use for decades while rolling past them on an ATV, which is common. \"The idea that this is a comprehensive inspection according to the federal regulations is a joke,\" he said.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration found during its checks that between 13% and 15% of all the cars still had defects after they were inspected by the railroads. But most of the problems federal inspectors found then weren't the kind of thing that would cause a derailment. The most common issues the railroads missed were things like bent hand rails workers use when climbing on cars.",
      "Alexy said it seems like \u201cwhatever is missed is not resulting in a huge impact to safety across the country.\u201d",
      "And Alexy said even if carmen had significantly more time to inspect cars, it is difficult to find the kind of flaws that cause derailments like failing bearings sealed inside an axle or cracked wheels. The East Palestine derailment was caused by a bad bearing that overheated but wasn't caught in time by trackside detectors that are designed to spot temperature increases like that.",
      "Norfolk Southern said this new standard will help them gauge whether they have enough carmen in every location to handle the required inspections because if it is taking longer than one minute they might need more people or the railroad may need to follow up with the shipper that owns the railcar to ensure needed maintenance is being done.",
      "\u201cBy no means are employees expected to ignore or disregard safety issues. If a problem is spotted, employees are required to address it, either by correcting the issue on site or by pulling the car for further maintenance,\u201d Norfolk Southern spokeswoman Heather Garcia said.",
      "Alexy said if that is truly how this rule is used, it might not be a problem. But he said that if the new one-minute standard is \u201ctaken to an extreme, it could be\u201d a step backwards in safety at Norfolk Southern, which has been stressing safety ever since the East Palestine derailment.",
      "The test will be how the rule is implemented by railroad managers in the field across the eastern United States where Norfolk Southern's trains operate."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "The United States Nordic combined program has been salvaged for the upcoming World Cup season, receiving desperately needed financial help from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation.",
      "FIS gave Nordic Combined USA a grant last week, a contingency the Steamboat Springs, Colorado-based nonprofit needed to enter a new partnership with its Norwegian counterpart.",
      "\u201cDefinitely an extreme relief,\u201d Niklas Malacinski, a 2026 Olympic hopeful, told The Associated Press. \u201cI don't know how else this would've been done.\u201d",
      "Americans who compete internationally in Nordic combined, which encompasses ski jumping and cross-country skiing, lost funding for training and coaching from USA Nordic Sport last June.",
      "That decision sent athletes, their parents and supporters of the sport scrambling to save the season for the U.S. men and women after they showed signs of improvement during a two-year partnership with the traditionally powerful Norwegians.",
      "Nordic Combined USA was created to pick up the pieces. The all-volunteer nonprofit led by president Jill Brabec, whose daughter, Alexa, is a Nordic combined athlete and four-time Olympian Taylor Fletcher asked donors for funds and made a grant request with FIS.",
      "About $350,000 has been raised toward the organization's $500,000 budget for the 2024-25 season.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,\u201d said Fletcher, who is on the Nordic Combined USA board.",
      "The Americans will share coaches, training facilities, sports science data and efforts to attract sponsors with Norges Hopplandslaget. Even though Norway competes with the U.S., it wants the country to be a part of a sport that is often overlooked outside of Norway, Germany and Austria.",
      "\u201cWe need the U.S. team up there to make Nordic combined stronger short term and long term,\u201d Team Norway sport director Ivar Stuan said.",
      "In the past, Americans have had some success in the sport. Bill Demong became the first from the U.S. to win Olympic gold in Nordic combined at the 2010 Vancouver Games, where the Americans also earned two silver medals.",
      "It is in sports' best interest to have an American presence because Nordic combined could potentially be cut from the 2030 Winter Games in the French Alps. That would be one way to address the discipline being the only Olympic sport without gender equality.",
      "\u201cThere's always that risk,\u201d Fletcher said. \"The Olympics are always looking at keeping the program fresh and adding sports can come at a cost of other sports.",
      "\u201cWe're going to focus on building the sport to create a great TV product in as many nations as possible. We're fortunate to have this partnership with Norway again to allow our athletes to showcase the sport in the U.S. and across the world.\u201d",
      "Nordic combined, which was part of the first Winter Olympics in 1924, challenges athletes in a unique way. They need to have finesse and be fearless for ski jumping and the strength and stamina necessary for a 10-kilometer cross-country course.",
      "The Nordic combined World Cup season begins Nov. 28 in Ruka, Finland.",
      "FIS Nordic combined race director Lasse Ottesen declined to say how much money was given to Nordic Combined USA.",
      "\u201cThe amount of the grant is confidential, but we hope the support will contribute to further development of the cooperation with Norway and the youth development,\u201d Ottesen said Tuesday. \u201cThe U.S. is an important part of the Nordic Combined family and we are of course looking forward to come back to Salt Lake in 2034 for the Olympic Games.\u201d",

      "Boras gave a pun-filled, 48-minute assessment of the market at the general managers meetings on Wednesday, calling Soto \u201cthe Mona Lisa of the museum.\u201d Boras said only a handful of players have matched Soto\u2019s accomplishments at age 26, mentioning Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Ted Williams, and boasted \u201che has literally 15 years more of his prime to offer.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a business opportunity where you can make literally billions of dollars by acquiring somebody,\u201d Boras said. \u201cYou can really see that owners, general managers, that they\u2019re kind of called upon to be championship magicians. ... It\u2019s hard to do, to put together that magic of a championship run, but behind every great magician obviously is the magic Juan.\u201d",
      "Ohtani agreed to his 10-year contract late last year and helped lead the team to its second World Series title in five years. The deal contains $680 million in deferred money payable from 2034-43, reducing its average annual value for purposes of baseball\u2019s luxury tax to approximately $46.08 million.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Ohtani has much to do with Juan Soto, at all,\u201d Boras said. \"It\u2019s not something we discuss or consider. Juan Soto is \u2014 he\u2019s in an age category that separates him from all.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that tax considerations are the focal point when you\u2019re talking about a business opportunity where you can make literally billions of dollars by acquiring somebody,\u201d he said.",
      "Boras sprinkled in attempts at humor when discussing several of his top free agents:",
      "\u2014First baseman Pete Alonso, nicknamed the Polar Bear: \u201cWe hear a lot about the bear market for power-hitting first baseman and for Pete\u2019s sake, it\u2019s the polar opposite.\u201d",

      "Soto was traded from Washington to San Diego in 2022 after turning down a $440 million, 15-year offer. He was dealt to the New York Yankees last December and hit .288 with 41 homers, 109 RBIs and 128 runs, hitting second in the batting order ahead of Aaron Judge. The Yankees want to retain Soto after he helped them reach the World Series for the first time since 2009.",
      "Soto is expected to be pursued by the New York Mets and billionaire owner Steve Cohen.",
      "\u201cThe Mets are obviously trying to get to their goal, which is winning a world championship,\u201d Boras said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been very clear about pursuing this aggressively.\u201d",
      "Soto intends to meet with owners who want him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to commit my career to it and I want the owner to commit his resources to it,\u201d Boras said of his client\u2019s mindset. \u201cThat\u2019s really why Juan Soto became a free agent.\u201d",
      "Boras said Soto would be a moneymaker for whichever team he signs with.",
      "\u201cWhen the owners win repeatedly, their revenues skyrocket. They develop the impact of postseason play, attendance, rights in the streaming world,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus the international branding.\u201d",
      "Boras maintained that disruption in broadcast revenue should not be a factor in the market, which was slow last offseason after Diamond Sports Group filed for bankruptcy. MLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season, the Colorado Rockies this year and the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins for 2025.",
      "\u201cThe TV uncertainty was kind of last year\u2019s question,\u201d Boras said. \u201cClubs have been offered contracts for (regional sports networks) and they\u2019ve rejected them. They\u2019re building their own platforms.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 16:18:18 -0500",
    "summary": "For a World Series that was supposed to feature an epic battle between sluggers Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, guys like Mark Leiter Jr., Luke Weaver, Alex Vesia and Anthony Banda sure got a lot of face time",

      "For a World Series that was supposed to feature an epic battle between sluggers Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, guys like Mark Leiter Jr., Luke Weaver, Alex Vesia and Anthony Banda sure got a lot of face time",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- For a World Series that was supposed to feature an epic battle between sluggers Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, guys like Mark Leiter Jr., Luke Weaver, Alex Vesia and Anthony Banda sure got a lot of face time.",
      "This year's Fall Classic provided further proof that a great bullpen is essential in baseball, particularly in the postseason. It also has led to concerns from people ranging from superagent Scott Boras to players' association head Tony Clark that the sport is abusing arms.",
      "Regardless, building a quality bullpen remains a challenge.",
      "\u201cYou need so many arms over the course of the season, and in the postseason, it\u2019s even more magnified,\u201d Los Angeles Angels general manager Perry Minasian said. \u201cQuality arms, quality strikes. But quantity is a big deal, too. Where do you get it?\u201d",
      "The bullpen is usually an afterthought for casual baseball fans, particularly middle relievers, who don't get the spotlight of the ninth inning. They toil in relative anonymity while getting tough outs in tough situations and are much like NFL offensive linemen \u2014 noticed only when something goes terribly wrong.",
      "The Dodgers used Vesia, Banda and Michael Kopech in four out of the five games of the World Series while Blake Treinen and Brusdar Graterol appeared in three games. They combined to throw 15 1/3 innings \u2014 often in high-leverage situations \u2014 and gave up five runs.",
      "That's a 2.93 ERA.",
      "For a bunch of guys only serious seamheads know, that's not too shabby.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of good players, and they understand that it\u2019s about getting 27 outs a night,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cIt could be anyone at any given moment.\u201d",
      "Building a big league bullpen is intriguing because cost isn't really the prohibitive factor, making it arguably the most egalitarian position in a sport that doesn't have a salary cap. Banda ($740,000), Vesia ($1 million), Treinen ($1 million), Kopech ($3 million) and Graterol ($2.7 million) made pocket change compared with their teammate Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year deal last offseason.",
      "Instead, it comes down to scouting, development and sometimes dumb luck. It's sometimes more art than science.",
      "\u201cI wish we knew,\u201d said Erik Neander, Tampa Bay's president of baseball operations. \u201cWe would have won more games last year.\u201d",
      "Boras is among those who aren\u2019t pleased with the way relievers are being used. Clay Holmes pitched for the Yankees in all five games of the World Series and there\u2019s little doubt that pitchers \u2014 particularly relievers \u2014 are being pushed to exhaustion in October.",
      "\u201cWe have got to stop burning up our beautiful young arms by pitching them in a way, in a manner, that we would never do during the (regular) season,\u201d Boras said Wednesday.",
      "Over the past 10 years, the average fastball velocity has risen from 93.3 mph to 95.5 during the 2024 regular season. Injury rates also have skyrocketed, with 484 pitchers going on the injured list this year, nearly double the 2014 total.",
      "Regardless of how GMs feel about bullpen usage, the injury explosion is one more reason that finding consistent relievers is a difficult task.",
      "Using valuable young arms in the bullpen is risky, but pursuing veteran relievers in free agency is also a crapshoot. Take the case of Treinen, a 36-year-old who has had a career that typifies the ups and downs of being a reliever.",
      "He was an All-Star in 2018 with the Oakland Athletics, with a microscopic 0.78 ERA and 100 strikeouts over 80 1/3 innings. The next year, he fell off drastically with a 4.91 ERA.",
      "The Dodgers thought he could bounce back in 2020 and they were right \u2014 he had a solid season and helped lead LA to a World Series title. It went so well that the Dodgers signed him to a two-year deal after the season. He was great again in 2021 but suffered a serious shoulder injury and missed almost the entire 2022 season.",
      "He signed an extension but missed the 2023 season with the same shoulder injury and didn't return until 2024, when he bounced back again with a 1.93 ERA and another championship.",
      "Now Treinen is back on the market.",
      "\u201cYou can look at it multiple ways,\u201d said Minasian, who was speaking generally and not about Treinen. \u201cYou might say: 'Wow, he's taken the ball a ton. He's been used drastically over the last three, four years, so I'm not sure what it's going to look like going forward,' or it could be: \u2018Hey, he\u2019s held up. He pitches. He's been consistent and takes the ball.'\u201d",
      "The Houston Astros are a team that's had a great bullpen over the last several years with pitchers like Hector Neris and Ryan Pressly. General manager Dana Brown said there's always volatility in the bullpen, but that's not all due to injuries.",
      "\u201cIt's just the game today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou have all this information, and sometimes the hitters, they study you. The film \u2014 they look at it. They find your weak spots and try to exploit you.\u201d",
      "Brown said one quality he likes in relievers is a sense of humility, understanding that they might have to change their strategy on the mound as their body deals with a long career.",
      "\u201cThe guys who don't have a teachable spirit, or the aptitude, they sometimes get lost in the sauce,\u201d Brown said.",

      "Pacers: After a sluggish 1-3 start, Indiana has won three of four because the Pacers are sharing the ball better and pushing the pace. It helps that Haliburton has regained more of his All-Star form after being slowed by a back injury.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Fernando Valenzuela was remembered for \u201chaving the heart of a lion\u201d throughout his stellar pitching career with the Los Angeles Dodgers during a funeral highlighting his Catholic faith on Wednesday.",
      "Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez sprinkled holy water on Valenzuela's casket and later waved incense over it. Nearby a portrait of a smiling Valenzuela rested against the altar.",
      "\u201cHis death came too soon,\u201d the Rev. James Anguiano said in his sermon.",
      "The public Mass at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles included fans wearing Dodgers gear, some in Valenzuela\u2019s No. 34 jersey. Many held up cell phones to record moments.",
      "Valenzuela died on Oct. 22 at age 63, three days before the Dodgers began their eventual run to the franchise's eighth World Series championship, beating the New York Yankees in five games last week. No cause of death was given.",
      "\u201cI really think Fernando hoped to witness the Dodgers win the World Series this year but you know he did witness the Dodgers as champions,\u201d Anguiano said. \u201cFernando had a front-row seat, perfect from heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know like I\u2019m standing here that Fernando is up there, he\u2019s letting us know he\u2019s doing well and he\u2019s celebrating along with the Dodgers in their World Series championship,\u201d said Mike Scioscia, who caught Valenzuela in many of his starts in 1981, including a five-hit shutout on Opening Day.",
      "The Dodgers went on to win the World Series that year, in six games against the Yankees. The Mexican-born Valenzuela is the only player to earn the NL Cy Young Award and Rookie of the Year honors in the same season.",
      "Scioscia, at times speaking in Spanish, eulogized Valenzuela for having \u201cthe heart of a lion.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was 20-years-old in 1981 when he was going through Fernandomania and he just kept perspective the whole way,\u201d Scioscia said. \u201cFernando never got too big for his britches. He was always well-grounded, he knew that he had a talent and he wanted to go out there and do it every time. He always felt he was the best in the world but he never told anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Fernando Valenzuela Jr. gave a tearful eulogy of his pap\u00e1 in Spanish, pausing to wipe his face with a white cloth. Valenzuela\u2019s wife, Linda, and other children Ricardo, Linda and Maria sat in the front row, along with his grandchildren.",
      "\u201cFernando no longer has to look up nor does he have to look down,\u201d Anguiano said, referring to Valenzuela's skyward glance during his unusual delivery. \u201cFernando is alive and present in our hearts and in our lives.\u201d",
      "The nine-member Mariachi Sol de Mexico played and sang throughout the service. It concluded with eight pallbearers ushering his casket covered in white roses to a waiting hearse.",
      "Former Dodgers Orel Hershiser, Ron Cey, Reggie Smith, Jerry Reuss, Manny Mota, Justin Turner, Rick Sutcliffe, Nomar Garciaparra and Jesse Orosco were among the mourners. They were joined by former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, current president and CEO Stan Kasten, team COO Bob Wolfe, team general counsel Sam Fernandez and actor Edward James Olmos.",

      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes practiced as usual Wednesday and plans to be ready for this weekend\u2019s game against the Broncos",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes practiced as usual Wednesday and plans to be ready for this weekend's game against the Broncos, two days after tweaking his left ankle while throwing a touchdown pass in a win over the Buccaneers.",
      "Mahomes was rolling to his right and thinking about running for a first down as the Chiefs were trying to rally in the second half against Tampa Bay on Monday night. He suddenly saw Samaje Perine coming open and flicked a pass to him in the end zone, just as his ankle caught in the soggy turf of Arrowhead Stadium and sent a sharp pain rocketing through it.",
      "Mahomes lay on the sideline for a moment before he was helped partway across the field, then trotted without any assistance the rest of the way to the Kansas City sideline. He was examined there but did not miss a play, eventually helping the Chiefs to another touchdown in regulation and the winning drive in overtime for a 30-24 victory over the Bucs.",
      "\u201cIt's doing good,\" Mahomes said of his ankle Wednesday. \"Obviously went on a little bit of a roll. It's a little sore. But I'm able to move around and looking forward to getting out in practice and seeing how I can push it as the week goes on.\u201d",
      "Mahomes has plenty of experience nursing ankle injuries.",
      "The most high-profile one occurred during the playoffs two seasons ago, and he needed every bit of help recovering in time to face the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Mahomes tweaked it again in the first half but returned to lead the Chiefs to victory.",
      "\u201cWe won't have to back off,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said of the two-time NFL MVP. \u201cHe manages it. He stays on top of it.\u201d",
      "That process began immediately after Monday night's game, then continued at home \u2014 every day made more important by the fact that Kansas City is facing the Broncos on a short week Sunday. Mahomes was in the practice facility early Tuesday to watch game film and get additional treatment, and he was ready for the first practice of the week Wednesday.",
      "\u201cYou can only do so much,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt was pretty late getting some stuff in the training room after the game, getting some stuff to take home. Stuff you can put on overnight to reduce swelling. You come in early in the morning \u2014 it was a long day of watching film and getting treatment, and preparing yourself for a short week.\u201d",
      "In other injury news, Reid said wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster still would not practice as he nurses a hamstring injury that has kept him out of most of the past three games. Defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton also was out with a bruised knee.",
      "Reid also had no update on Charles Omenihu and Isiah Pacheco, both of whom the Chiefs hope to get back for the stretch run.",
      "Omenihu tore the ACL in his right knee in their AFC title win over Baltimore and had surgery in February, and he has spent the entire season on the physically unable-to-perform list. Pacheco has been out since Week 2, when he fractured his fibula in a win over Cincinnati and landed on injured reserve following surgery.",
      "The Chiefs have been able to overcome a host of injuries \u2014 including devastating ones to Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown that thinned out their wide receiver corps \u2014 by making some savvy moves in the front office.",
      "Kansas City traded for Patriots defensive end Joshua Uche just before the deadline, and he made his debut as a pass-rushing specialist in Monday night's win over the Buccaneers. The Chiefs also signed Kareem Hunt after Pacheco's injury, and their one-time star has delivered: He has logged at least 21 carries in each of the last four games, scoring touchdowns in all of them, and has twice eclipsed 100 yards, including the winning two-yard TD plunge in overtime against Tampa Bay.",
      "Perhaps none of the moves has been as high-profile as the Chiefs' trade with Tennessee for DeAndre Hopkins, though.",
      "The three-time All-Pro wide receiver practiced just two days before playing a limited role in a win in Las Vegas. Then, he logged a full week of work and showed out Monday night, catching eight passes for 86 yards and two scores against the Bucs.",
      "\u201cYou just continue to get him more and more comfortable in the offense,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cWe move him around and let him do what he's special at, and that's catching the football and winning those one-on-one matchups.\u201d",

      "Jayden Daniels has not thought much about his rookie year",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- Jayden Daniels has not given much thought to how he has handled half a season playing quarterback in the NFL.",
      "\"I still have some ways to go,\" he said. \"I\u2019ll sit back and reflect after my rookie year is done.\"",
      "That's OK. The rest of the sport has plenty to say about Daniels taking the league by storm, leading the Washington Commanders to their first 7-2 start since 1996 and becoming not only the favorite to be the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year but putting himself firmly in the MVP conversation.",
      "\u201cYou guys got to stop calling him a rookie quarterback,\" veteran tight end Zach Ertz said. \"He may be a rookie quarterback in terms of years in this league. But his maturity, his poise is that of a 10-year vet.\u201d",
      "Daniels' breakout season has come as no surprise to those who knew the San Bernadino, California, native during stints at Arizona State and then LSU, where he blossomed into the 2023 Heisman Trophy winner and the second pick in the draft. Teammates turned friends and coaches over the years have seen a player determined to be the best and a person humble enough to make these past nine weeks look like just the start of a lengthy career with no limit on what Daniels could accomplish.",
      "Inheriting the pressure of being Washington's face of the franchise for an organization decades removed from its glory days did not seem to get to Daniels, who teammates have said has had the same approach since the first day of offseason workouts through throwing a Hail Mary touchdown pass to Noah Brown in Week 8 to beat Chicago.",
      "That is one of his first 163 completions on 228 attempts \u2014 a success rate of 71.5% that ranks among the best QBs in the NFL of any experience level. He has thrown for nine touchdowns, run for four more and has just two interceptions.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn the ball over a lot,\u201d said Herm Edwards, who coached Daniels for three seasons at Arizona State. \u201cThat isn\u2019t part of his DNA. That\u2019s not what happens. You never worry about that as far as him with the football in his hand, whether he\u2019s throwing it or running. He\u2019s become a smarter runner, obviously, and that\u2019s needed in this league.\"",
      "The biggest blip for Daniels came when he injured his ribs getting tackled and landing awkwardly at the end of a long run. He left that game \u2014 a 40-7 rout of Carolina \u2014 and might have played if the stakes were higher, then he was right back on the field a week later.",
      "Daniels, even with sore ribs, has thrown for 535 yards and three TDs and ran 16 times for 87 yards.",
      "\"It\u2019s not a surprise to me,\" said San Francisco receiver Brandon Aiyuk, a teammate of Daniels' at Arizona State. \u201cHe\u2019s just nice. He\u2019s real good. He\u2019s just always been that good.\u201d",
      "Malik Nabers heard the chatter about Daniels when he was transferring to LSU in 2022, and that first season finished with some great numbers: 17 touchdowns, three interceptions and a 10-4 record. Then, after training with C.J. Stroud and others in California, Nabers noticed a shift in Daniels' mindset and demeanor.",
      "\u201cHe was just like picking defenses apart,\u201d said Nabers, the sixth pick in the draft and now the No. 1 receiver for the NFC East-rival New York Giants. \"He was working extra, staying extra long, making sure we got the plays after practice. He was the ultimate leader. I think that\u2019s what he changed: He became like the ultimate leader and started leading by example, leading by vocalness and just taking the offense over.\u201d",
      "Daniels led the country with 40 TD passes in 2023, ran for 10 more and won the Heisman as the final accomplishment of his college career. But the arriving early and staying late did not stop, from walkthroughs in the team's practice bubble before spring workouts with rookie receiver Luke McCaffrey to nights coach Dan Quinn observed Daniels studying film well after dark during the Commanders' week in Arizona between games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any magic that\u2019s going into this. ... He really puts in the work,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic pixie dust that we\u2019re throwing into him. It is absolutely grinding, working, and a lot of confidence comes from that.\u201d",
      "It's not just sweat equity. At LSU, Daniels underwent cognitive processing tests on a computer, and with the school's director of performance innovation, Jack Marucci, developed a program with a virtual reality headset to work on his anticipation.",
      "\u201cYou could see his efficiency and speed improving and how he was scanning,\" Marucci said, pointing out it was like Daniels got another 250 snaps a week and 2,600 over the course of a season. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing and anticipating where he\u2019s going to end up and now you have to hit a spot on the field.\u201d",
      "Daniels still uses the VR device, which offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury is \u201call-in on.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a great tool, not just for me, but the other quarterbacks \u2014 the guys that want to use it to get an edge and get the reps without having to go out there and physically do stuff,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "Kingsbury interviewed for multiple jobs around the NFL. After coaching Patrick Mahomes at Texas Tech, Kyler Murray with the Arizona Cardinals and then (as an adviser) with Caleb Williams at Southern California, the chance to work with Daniels \u2014 who was drafted a few months after he was hired in Washington \u2014 and the Commanders made too much sense.",
      "\u201cKliff Kingsbury is an outstanding fit for him,\" LSU coach Brian Kelly said. \u201cAnd the kind of offense that they run, it\u2019s something that I think is seamless for him.\"",
      "Cam Taylor-Britt derided it as \u201csimple\u201d and a \u201cnice college offense.\u201d Daniels burned the Cincinnati Bengals cornerback and his teammates on 21 of 23 passing for 254 yards and two touchdowns in a 38-33 victory in prime time on \u201cMonday Night Football.\"",
      "When the Bears-Commanders game was flexed to national TV, it provided Daniels' signature moment so far when he scrambled for nearly 13 seconds and lofted up a pass that sailed 65 yards in the air before tipping up and into Brown's hands in the end zone.",
      "Edwards, who still texts Daniels on a regular basis, almost foreshadowed it talking about the 23-year-old two weeks before the Chicago game.",
      "\u201cHe has the ability to extend plays, and what he does \u2014 and people can already see it and it\u2019s not luck \u2014 he can throw the deep ball,\u201d said Edwards, who's now an ESPN analyst. \u201cHe can throw it with accuracy on the run or from the pocket. He has a feel for throwing the ball down the field.\u201d",
      "The Hail Mary exemplified what everyone around Daniels raves about: his poise under pressure. Edwards calls it Daniels' \u201cability to keep his composure when the lights got the brightest.\u201d",
      "Terry McLaurin, who has been Washington's top receiver since being drafted in 2019, said Daniels came into the league more ready than most rookies at the most important position in sports.",
      "That has been obvious even to opponents. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson after outdueling Daniels said his counterpart has been proving himself and playing amazing.",
      "\u201cWashington is in good hands with him,\u201d Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith said \u201cHe\u2019s the truth.\"",
      "Only Jackson, Buffalo's Josh Allen, Mahomes and Detroit's Jared Goff have shorter MVP odds on BetMGM Sportsbook, which now has Daniels at 10-1. Nabers, who initially made a friendly $10,000 bet with Daniels about which one would be AP Offensive Rookie of the Year before canceling it, said his friend's success stems from a desire to win that he doesn't see in many others.",
      "\u201cI know when he is in that moment, he\u2019s not scared of it,\u201d Nabers said. \"He\u2019s not scared of the hype, the big plays to be made. If it is crunch time, he wants to ball.\u201d",

      "Whenever a team is trailing by seven points late in a game and driving, the talk quickly turns to whether it will go for 2 and the win if it happens to score a touchdown.",
      "Tampa Bay, New England and Seattle all opted against it in Week 9 and ended up as overtime losers.",
      "The situations weren't entirely identical, with the Seahawks scoring with 51 seconds left, the Patriots on the final play with an exhausted Drake Maye and the Buccaneers with 27 seconds left and Patrick Mahomes on the other side. But the decisions and the outcomes were the same.",
      "Were those necessarily bad decisions?",
      "The data says maybe not, with teams opting to kick the extra point in the final minute of regulation having a slightly higher winning percentage than teams that go for 2 historically.",
      "According to numbers tracked by Sportradar back to 2000, teams that attempted the extra point have a 37-49-2 (.432) record in those scenarios even after the three losses this week.",
      "That includes two defeats when the kicker missed the extra point, 10 more losses when the opposing team scored before the end of regulation and six wins when the team got the ball back and scored \u2014 with five of those following turnovers.",
      "Teams that tried for 2 had a 10-15 (.400) record, having made 12 of the 2-point tries. But two of those makes led to losses when the opposing team drove for a late field goal \u2014 including a game in 2019 when the Bears converted a fourth down after giving up the go-ahead 2-point try to Denver on the way to kicking a game-winning field goal.",
      "Complicating the decision this year is that teams are converting 2-point tries at a record-low rate. From 2010-23, making the 2-point try had been essentially a coin-flip proposition, with teams converting 48.7% of tries. That has dropped to 32.4% during the first half of this season.",
      "Kansas City's overtime victory against Tampa Bay delivered another tight win to a Chiefs team that just seems to have a knack for pulling out nail-biters.",
      "The Chiefs improved to 8-0, becoming the sixth Super Bowl champion to start the following season with eight straight wins \u2014 with six of those victories coming by seven points or fewer.",
      "The Chiefs are the 41st team overall to start a season 8-0 and their average margin of victory of 7.0 points per game is the lowest of any of those teams, beating out the 2006 Colts, who were at 7.4 points per game on the way to winning it all.",
      "Kansas City has won 14 straight since a Christmas loss to Las Vegas last year for the longest NFL winning streak since Carolina began the 2015 campaign with a 14-0 record. A win on Sunday against Denver would give the Chiefs the first 15-game streak since Green Bay won 19 in a row from 2010-11.",
      "Winning close games is nothing new for Mahomes, who has a 49-12 (.712) career record in the regular season and playoffs in games decided by seven points or fewer. Only Daryle Lamonica has a better win percentage (.771) among quarterbacks who have started in at least 30 close games.",
      "When it comes to \u201c perfect\u201d passer ratings, Lamar Jackson now stands alone.",
      "Jackson completed 16 of 19 passes for 280 yards, three TDs and no interceptions in Baltimore's win over Denver on Sunday to record his fourth career game with the highest attainable passer rating of 158.3.",
      "Jackson has the most career regular-season games with at least 15 attempts and a perfect rating, having also done it once last season and twice in his first full season as a starter in 2019.",
      "Four other QBs have done it three times: Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger. Manning also had a fourth in the playoffs, doing it in a 2003 wild-card win over Denver.",
      "Jackson has seven straight games this season with a rating of 100 or better, tied for the eighth-longest streak ever.",
      "Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown have an almost perfect connection this season.",
      "St. Brown has caught his last 30 targets from Goff after the two went 7 for 7 in Detroit's win over Green Bay. That is tied with Buffalo's Khalil Shakir for the longest streak of catches without an incompletion for a wide receiver since NextGen stats began tracking the stat in 2016.",
      "Zebra Sports calculated the probability that a player would have caught all of those targets based on the difficulty of each throw and said it had a probability of about 1 in 780,000.",
      "For the season, St. Brown has caught 48 of 59 passes from Goff, with the 133.3 passer rating on those throws ranking No. 1 among all duos with at least 40 attempts, according to Sportradar.",

      "The Cleveland Cavaliers are returning home in rare air",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Taking their cues from Jarrett Allen, the Cleveland Cavaliers celebrated the first 9-0 start to a season in franchise history by pouring water bottles over coach Kenny Atkinson's head in the locker room.",
      "There will be much bigger games, with higher stakes, than the Cavs' 131-122 victory in New Orleans on Wednesday night.",
      "But Atkinson didn't mind taking a moment to enjoy something no other Cavs team had done in the 55 years since Cleveland joined the NBA for the 1970-71 season.",
      "\u201cYou have to,\u201d said Atkinson, who also became the first NBA coach to win his first nine games with a new team. \u201cThis season\u2019s so long. It's so hard to win in this league. So, when you do have moments like this, you have to celebrate a little.\"",
      "After hitting 54.2% of their shots in the Big Easy \u2014 including 48.6% (17 of 35) from 3-point range \u2014 the Cavs are shooting an NBA-best 52.6% on the season from the field.",
      "\u201cWe're playing good basketball,\u201d said All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, who had a team-high 29 points in New Orleans, while five other teammates scored 11 or more. \"We've done it in so many different ways. We've had blowouts, close games, come-from-behind wins.",
      "\u201cIt's just the habits that really get me excited about what we're doing,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cMy biggest thing is just being consistent. Let's continually be this team.\u201d",
      "Cleveland next plays at home Friday night against the Golden State Warriors, who set the NBA record for the best start to a season by winning their first 24 games during the 2015-16 campaign.",
      "Against the Pelicans, the Cavs got 50 points from reserves while four of five starters scored 14 or more.",
      "\u201cAgain, everyone contributes,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cIt's what good teams do. We're in a good place physically. We're in a good place mentally.",
      "\u201cWhen you win nine in a row, it's not one or two guys; it's the whole roster,\u201d he added.",
      "In his four previous seasons as a head coach with Brooklyn, Atkinson had just one winning record, going 42-40 in 2018-19.",
      "He spent the past four seasons as an assistant \u2014 the first with the Los Angeles Clippers and the last three with Golden State.",
      "Now, he's off to a rather auspicious start in his second head coaching stint, albeit with a team that won a playoff series a season ago and was expected to be in the Eastern Conference postseason picture again this season.",
      "\u201cThe vibes are great, energy's great, he's done a phenomenal job with us and we've also bought in,\" Mitchell said. \"He's given us input but also allowed us to give input ourselves and I think that's what's special.\u201d",
      "Atkinson, meanwhile, sounds gratified by the synergy he's sensed not only among his players, but between them and himself.",
      "\u201cWhat I think about is this team and the camaraderie they have, and the chemistry we have going and how connected they are,\u201d Atkinson said. \"I've been fortunate to land with a really good group, a group that's been really successful in the past and I'm happy for them \u2014 and I think they're happy for me in the locker room.",
      "\u201cThere's a bond between the head coach and a team,\u201d Atkinson continued. \u201cYou've got to celebrate those moments and it's pretty cool.\u201d",

      "Fans booed George when he was introduced at Intuit Dome, the Clippers\u2019 new arena that seats 18,000 but drew announced attendance of 15,627. They got vocal each time he touched the ball throughout the game. Early on, he responded by hitting back-to-back 3-pointers.",
      "\u201cBoo him tonight and love him afterwards,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said before the game.",

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

    "story": [
      "The Australian government has announced what it describes as world-leading legislation that would set 16 years as the minimum age for children to use social media and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",

      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",

      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "Since the beginning of the 2024 school year in August, students in Broward County Public Schools, the country\u2019s sixth largest district, have been barred from using cellphones during the school day, including during lunch and breaks, unless given special permission.",
      "The schools are some of the many across the country wrestling with how to crack down on cellphones, at a time when experts say social media use among young people is nearly universal \u2013 and that screen time is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression among kids.",

      "A small facility in Cyprus is hosting senior government officials from as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",

      "A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it survived a massive earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant has been shut down again due to an equipment problem",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it had survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant was shut down again Monday due to an equipment problem, its operator said.",
      "The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan\u2019s northern coast was put back online on Oct. 29 and had been expected to start generating power in early November.",
      "But it had to be shut down again five days after its restart due to a glitch that occurred Sunday in a device related to neutron data inside the reactor, plant operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said.",
      "The reactor was operating normally and there was no release of radiation into the environment, Tohoku Electric said. The utility said it decided to shut it down to re-examine equipment to address residents' safety concerns. No new date for a restart was given.",
      "The reactor is one of three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation.",
      "The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami triggered by the quake but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns.",
      "All of Japan\u2019s 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 was the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to restart.",
      "Japan's government last year adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy and is pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024. killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. It caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:38:20 -0500",
    "summary": "It&rsquo;s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

While you can still block accounts, those accounts will now be able to see your posts unless you have made your account private. They won't, however, be able to reply to them or repost them. Blocked accounts also won't be able to follow you and you won't be able to follow them, as has been the case before the policy change.",

      "But critics say the changes could harm victims and survivors of abuse, for instance.

When a nonprofit research group documented a rise of hate speech on the platform, X sued them. The lawsuit was dismissed.",

      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",

Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",

      "The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 4-kilometer (2.4 mile) radius of the crater.",

      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",
      "The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or \u201cknowingly\u201d employed people with \u201cproclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\"",
      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",
      "The company \u201chas grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,\u201d Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. \u201cIt is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.\u201d",
      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI \u2014 marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \u201c100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\u201d",
      "In a Friday post on X sharing Spiro's letter, Donaldson wrote that he \u201cwas asked to refrain from making public statements to enable a detailed and unbiased investigation.\u201d",
      "Pansino, one of Donaldson\u2019s most vocal critics, responded on X that the findings of \u201cworkplace harassment and misconduct\u201d and \u201cmultiple firings\u201d mean \"it might be time for a bigger investigation.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's level of fame and growth place him in \u201cpretty rare company,\u201d said advertising lawyer Robert Freund, whose practice helps creators resolve disputes. He said he suspects the letter was released in attempt to assure stakeholders \u201cthat he's running a professional operation.\u201d",

      "Conservationists and a Native American advocacy group are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "Eds: This story has been corrected to show the Western Shoshone Defense Project is a Native American advocacy group, not a recognized tribe."

      "Japan is planning an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka to make up for a shortage of truck drivers",
      "TOKYO -- Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a \u201cconveyor belt road\u201d by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers.",
      "The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries.",
      "A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an \u201cauto flow road,\u201d in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s.",
      "\u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.",
      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",
      "In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports.",
      "The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height, or nearly six feet, and are 110 centimeters, or 3.6 feet, by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet.",
      "The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future.",
      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",
      "Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.",
      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",
      "Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls.",
      "As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing.",
      "In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer.",
      "The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers.",
      "Trucks carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, and about 60% of Japan\u2019s fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems.",
      "\u201cThat means the 2024 problem isn\u2019t just a transportation problem but really a people\u2019s problem,\u201d Yano said.",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to clarify remarks he made at a New York campaign rally where he suggested that Republicans may try to repeal legislation that has spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Republicans \u201cprobably will\u201d try to repeal legislation that spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips, a statement he quickly tried to walk back by saying he would like to instead \u201cstreamline\u201d it.",
      "Johnson made the initial comment while campaigning for a vulnerable New York GOP congressman in a district that is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant.",
      "A reporter asked Johnson whether he would try to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had disparaged last week. \u201cI expect that we probably will, but we haven\u2019t developed that part of the agenda yet,\" Johnson replied.",
      "Democrats quickly jumped on the Republican speaker\u2019s comments, warning that it showed how Johnson and Trump are pursuing an aggressive conservative agenda bent on dismantling even popular government programs. The White House has credited the CHIPS Act for spurring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris has pointed to the legislation on the campaign trail as proof that Democrats can be entrusted with the U.S. economy.",
      "Johnson, who voted against the legislation, later said in a statement that the CHIPS Act, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, \u201cis not on the agenda for repeal.\"",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill\u2014to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements,\u201d the speaker's statement said.",
      "It wasn't the first recent comment Johnson has had to walk back. Earlier this week he had to clean up comments he made saying he wanted to \u201ctake a blow torch to the regulatory state\u201d and make \u201cmassive\u201d changes to the Affordable Care Act. After facing political blowback, he said that repealing the health care law was \u201cnot on the table.\u201d",
      "The incident was emblematic of Johnson's struggle working closely with Trump and at the same time campaigning for his House colleagues, especially those locked in tough reelection battles that are crucial to Republicans holding a narrow majority. The speaker was campaigning for Rep. Brandon Williams, a New York Republican who worked in the tech industry before running for Congress and supported the CHIPS Act.",
      "Williams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after he suggested that the act could be repealed.",
      "\u201cHe apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Williams' district is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company has said it received grants of $6.1 billion from the CHIPS Act to support its plans.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday, \u201cAnyone threatening to repeal the CHIPS & Science Act is threatening more than 50,000 good-paying jobs in Upstate New York and $231 billion worth of economic growth nationwide.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping that the comments give them a late boost as they try to court working class voters in regions that depend on factory jobs. Harris, during a campaign stop in Saginaw, Michigan earlier this week, toured another semiconductor factory to bring attention to the 2022 law.",
      "In response to Johnson's comments Friday, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, Ammar Moussa, said, \"Harris is running to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and make us competitive globally. The only way to guarantee these Republicans never get a chance to repeal these laws that are creating jobs and saving Americans money is to elect her president.\u201d",
      "As of August, the CHIPS and Science Act had provided $30 billion in support for 23 projects in 15 states that would add 115,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, according to the Commerce Department. That funding helped to draw in private capital and would enable the United States to produce 30% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, up from 0% when the Biden-Harris administration succeeded Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "Viet Shelton, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, \u201cMost politicians usually go to a community promising to create jobs in the town they\u2019re visiting\u2026 Mike Johnson, ever the trendsetter, decided to visit a town and promise to kill jobs in that town.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 23:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats hoped that voters wanted to move on from Donald Trump. Instead, they wanted more of him.",
    "story": [
      "\"Clearly, voters thought the country was on the wrong track,\" one Democrat said.",
      "In the end, most voters did want to go back.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats pounded away at a message of turning the page on former President Donald Trump and his brand of politics, promoting former aides who questioned his commitment to democracy and producing their own plans to combat things like price gouging and high home costs.",
      "Wednesday morning, though, they were reckoning with a stunning sweep by Trump, who as the now-president-elect, appeared set for a swing-state sweep and left Democrats wondering how it all went so wrong.",
      "\"Complete, unmitigated disaster,\" Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said when asked about the results. \"That was a wholesale repudiation of the Democratic message, the Democratic strategy, Harris' candidacy. There is no way to sugarcoat what an abject disaster this was.\"",
      "Trump's victory was thorough. He was projected to win or on pace to take all seven swing states up for grabs, while cutting down his margins in blue states from Minnesota to Virginia to New York. He lost women by 10 points after losing them by 15 in 2020, even after fury erupted over the scrapping of constitutional abortion protections. And he cut Harris' margin among Latino voters to 8 points after losing them by 33 points four years ago.",
      "Democrats, still licking their wounds as they spoke to ABC News Wednesday, had a laundry list of prescriptions for the party's woes, both strategically in how the 2024 race was waged and more fundamentally in how the party is perceived coast to coast and the state of its coalition.",
      "Harris took over in a particularly hectic series of events, taking over as Democrats' nominee from Joe Biden after the president's ruinous June debate poured jet fuel on concerns over his age and fitness for office.",
      "Many expressed dismay and frustration, distressed that Harris' historic candidacy and the party brand overall held insufficient appeal to win over voters who instead backed a twice-impeached former president convicted of 34 felonies whose closing message was so unfocused that it included riffing on a famous golfer's genitalia.",
      "Logistically, most pointed out the compressed timeline. In a country where elections have begun to run nearly two years long, Harris had about 100 days, leading some to point the finger at Biden for staying in the race as long as he did over the summer -- or even running for reelection at all.",
      "\"He never should've\" run for reelection, said Jim Kessler, the founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. \"Democrats and the Biden White House did not do a good enough job listening to the people, and they were saying loud and clear, 'your age is a concern.' And they chose to ignore that. They were also saying, the border's a concern, and so is crime. And they got to the right place on all of those things, including Biden's age. But it took them too long.\"",
      "Harris and Biden for weeks before the election touted policies they said would help Americans deal with rising costs and hammered Trump for essentially killing a bipartisan bill that would've strengthened border enforcement.",
      "But for months before that, the White House had insisted that the economy was strong, noting low unemployment numbers and the stock market while batting down worries over things like grocery costs, and was frustrated over the inability to stem the rise in unauthorized border crossings before leaning on executive orders that echoed those Trump himself had enacted.",
      "Trump and his allies went to work to paint Harris as out of touch on even more issues, blanketing the airwaves with ads highlighting Harris' policies from her 2019 run, including one underscoring her support for surgeries for transgender inmates, with a narrator saying that she was \"for they/them\" while Trump is \"for you.\"",
      "All the while, Harris, a loyal No. 2, appeared uncomfortable distancing herself from her boss.",
      "Later in the race, she insisted that her administration would not be a \"continuation\" of Biden's and that she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, which Biden hadn't done. But a viral clip on ABC's \"The View\" in which she said she couldn't think of anything substantively she'd do differently helped cement the existing link she had to a president whose approval rating was historically low enough to sink his party in a presidential race.",
      "\"Clearly, voters thought the country was on the wrong track, and she became the status quo candidate,\" said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville. \"And the history of status quo candidates\u2026is not good.\"",
      "Some Democrats boiled it down to a phrase that Carville himself made famous: it's the economy, stupid.",
      "A Gallup poll conducted in September 2020 -- the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic -- found that Americans said they were better off than they were four years ago by a 22-point margin. The same poll conducted last September fond that Americans believed they were worse off than they were four years ago by a 13-point margin -- a 35-point swing.",
      "\"It's the inflation, stupid, right?\" said one source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking. \"At the end of the day, the biggest driver of people's voting behavior is their economic self-interest, and they felt, by a wide margin, that they were doing pretty well under Donald Trump and that they were not doing well under the current administration. Not to say that other stuff wasn't important, but it was all superseded by their own economic conditions.\"",
      "Beyond her association with Biden, Harris also leaned into one of his favorite arguments against Trump -- that he posed a threat to democracy.",
      "She had shunted the theme early in her campaign, instead working to introduce herself in an atmosphere of \"joy.\" But as old administration aides like John Kelly rebuked him as undemocratic, she pounced on a message that Democrats ultimately said felt unconnected to voters' everyday struggles.",
      "\"Democrats often make the mistake of focusing on long term problems at a time when voters have immediate concerns. And democracy seems like a long-term issue, and it's not quite tangible. But gas prices, grocery prices, border crossings, a sense that crime is rising, those you feel every day,\" Kessler said.",
      "Some Democrats saw deeper troubles.",
      "Gone were the days when Democrats appealed to working and middle-class Americans they said. In their place were rallies with Beyonce and concerts with Bruce Springsteen, while Democrats, in critics' telling, lectured voters on why the party was right on the issues instead of empathizing with their underlying concerns.",
      "In short, philosophizing rather than fighting.",
      "\"It was the economy, was inflation, it was concerned about the border, and those were, for the most part, the top two issues,\" Kofinis said. \"We had no strategy in order to address that. And as a result, we just fed that alienation. Then in classic Democratic presidential campaign strategy that was eerily reminiscent to 2016, we embrace celebrities and the elites to somehow influence and dictate to the average voter how they should vote.\"",
      "\"I joined the Democratic Party because I wanted to fight NAFTA trade deals. I joined the Democratic Party because I wanted to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I joined the Democratic Party because I was tired of seeing my tax dollars go to foreign wars while my community was crumbling. That sounds like Donald Trump today. We have to take that message back,\" added Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha.",
      "For Republicans, everything went right this election.",
      "Rather than deepen opposition, Trump's controversies and legal struggles deepened loyalties among his base. Rather than gin Democratic turnout, abortion ballot measures appeared to offer voters an off-ramp to fight for reproductive autonomy while separately registering their discontent with the current administration. And instead of running against a candidate who offered a fresh vision from the current White House, Trump faced the second-highest ranking official in it.",
      "Now, the struggle will be continuing the success.",
      "Trump's romp has the wind at Republicans' backs, and, should the GOP take the House of Representatives, he'll have at least two years to cement a string of accomplishments with a pliant Congress. But term limits bar Trump from running again, and replicating his coalition is easier said than done.",
      "\"That's what's going to be very, very difficult,\" said GOP pollster Robert Blizzard, who worked on the 2024 presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- one of several Republicans who ran for the White House adopting Trump's pugilistic style only to be overwhelmingly rejected by primary voters this year.",
      "Yet in recognition of the gravitation pull that Trump has on the country's politics, even some Democrats said their path back to electoral success lies in part on the president-elect.",
      "Voters \"are hoping to get a repeat of the economy that they liked in his first term. If they get that, the path back for Democrats in 2028 is going to be quite difficult. But if his tariffs drive up inflation and his recklessness really demonstrates to voters that he does not have the special sauce on the economy that many think that he does, that will create a real opening,\" said the source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.",
      "\"It's tough, but it's just the reality of Trump in many ways.\"",

    "title": "Dismantling the Department of Education? Trump's plan for schools in his second term",
    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 20:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump has proposed featuring prayer in public schools and dismantling the Department of Education.",
    "story": [
      "Trump has previously proposed dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "Former President Donald Trump -- now projected to be the next president of the United States -- has proposed sweeping reform for the nation's educational systems.",
      "Here's a look at what areas of education his second term might impact:",
      "Department of Education",
      "Trump's Agenda47 campaign proposed eliminating the Department of Education -- which, according to the DOE website, \"establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education.\"",
      "The DOE, established by President Jimmy Carter, provides programs such as Title I funding for low-achieving or high-poverty K-12 schools in need of support, as well as Pell Grants for undergraduate students in high financial need.",
      "Throughout Trump's first presidency, he proposed billions in cuts to the Department of Education's budget.",
      "In a campaign video, Trump said he wants states -- not the federal government -- to have control over schools.",
      "However, he has also outlined plans to further restrict content or classroom discussion in schools based on guidelines that would be executed at the federal level.",
      "Content restrictions",
      "Trump's campaign has outlined a plan that features prayer in public schools, an expansion of parental rights in education, patriotism as a centerpiece of education and an emphasis on the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "He has also called for the dismantling of diversity initiatives in education and federal funding cuts for schools or programs that feature \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.\" Republican-backed legislation across the country has similarly sought to limit these topics, and the efforts have been criticized for being vague and leading to \"censorship\" in schools and classrooms on topics concerning race, gender and politics.",
      "Similar policies and rhetoric against school content concerning race, gender, sex and more have coincided with the removal of more than 10,000 books from library shelves over the 2023-2024 school year, according to the free-expression advocacy group PEN America.",
      "Trump has also suggested that he would create a new credentialing body to certify teachers \"who embrace patriotic values and support the American Way of Life\" and reinstate his administration's 1776 Commission to align the teaching of history with the \"values\" of the founding of the United States -- though Agenda47 does not elaborate further on what such values are or define the criteria for embracing the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "School choice",
      "Trump also backs nationwide universal school choice programs, which allow a student's allotment of public education funds to be transferred to nonpublic schooling options -- including private schools or homeschooling.",
      "This comes as voters in three states -- Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado -- have rejected efforts to codify or expand this kind of school choice.",
      "Teacher pay and tenure",
      "Trump's Agenda47 also anticipates an end to teacher tenure laws. These laws are described by the United Federation of Teachers as state laws that prevent a school district from dismissing a tenured teacher without due process. Most states have tenure laws in place; however, at least 10 states have zero or limited tenure laws, according to the National Education Association.",
      "He also said he will adopt a merit pay for teachers. Some studies have shown that merit pay programs improve student outcomes, but critics argue there is not enough evidence and that various factors impact student performance -- including funding and resource inequity.",
      "Higher education",
      "Trump's agenda for higher education includes creating a new, free university called the \"American Academy\" and fund it by \"taxing, fining and suing\" private universities.",

      "She is set to be the first Indian American second lady in the White House.",
      "The White House is set to see another history-making vice presidential spouse.",
      "With Ohio Sen. JD Vance set to become the next vice president, his wife, Usha Vance, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, is set to be the first Indian American second lady in the White House. She will also be the first Hindu second lady.",
      "That will follow Doug Emhoff's history-making mark as the first second gentleman in the White House. He is also the first Jewish person in the role.",
      "JD Vance thanked \"my beautiful wife for making it possible to do this\" on social media on Wednesday, after multiple news organizations, including ABC News, projected that former President Donald Trump will win the presidential match-up against Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "At 38, Usha Vance is set to be the youngest second lady since the Truman administration, when then-38-year-old Jane Hadley Barkley, wife of former Vice President Alben Barkley, assumed the role in 1949.",
      "She was raised in a Hindu household in San Diego, where her parents are academics.",
      "The Vances met during their time at Yale Law School and got married in Kentucky in 2014. They have three children together.",
      "An attorney who once clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, she left her law firm, Munger, Tolles & Olsen, after her husband was formally announced as former President Donald Trump's running mate on the Republican party ticket in July.",
      "Usha Vance was in the spotlight at the Republican National Convention, where she introduced her husband.",
      "\"My background is very different from JD's. I grew up in San Diego, in a middle-class community with two loving parents, both immigrants from India, and a wonderful sister,\" she said at the convention. \"That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country.\"",
      "She has since taken on a more behind-the-scenes role on the campaign trail, not delivering any remarks at a public campaign event since the RNC.",
      "\"Obviously, at the convention, I was asked to introduce JD, and so that was an active role,\" she told NBC News in October. \"But the thing that JD asked, and the thing that I certainly agreed to do, is to keep him company.\"",
      "She told NBC News at the time that she hadn't given much thought to what causes or initiatives she might focus on if she became the second lady.",
      "\"You know, this is such an intense and busy experience that I have not given a ton of thought to my own roles and responsibilities,\" she said.",
      "\"And so I thought, what would I do? See what happens on Nov. 5, and collect some information myself and take it from there,\" she said. \"There are certainly things I'm interested in, but I don't really know how that all fits into this role.\"",
      "In her first interview after JD Vance was named Trump's running mate, Usha Vance discussed with \"Fox & Friends\" how she and her husband share different political views and suggested that their opinions influence each other in a \"nice give and take.\"",
      "\"I mean, we're two different people. We have lots of different backgrounds and interests and things like that, so we come to different conclusions all the time,\" she said. \"That's part of the fun of being married.\"",
      "She was also asked to respond to her husband's widely criticized \"childless cat ladies\" comment, which was directed at Harris and others in a recently resurfaced 2021 Fox News interview.",
      "\"He made a quip in service of making a point that he wanted to make that was substantive,\" she said. \"And I just wish sometimes that people would talk about those things and that we would spend a lot less time just sort of going through this three-word phrase or that three-word phrase.\"",
      "She told \"Fox & Friends\" that she never thought she'd be in politics, that they planned to be lawyers with a family, and that they have agreed to keep their children out of the spotlight.",
      "\"Through his Senate candidacy, we had a lot of serious conversations, because, you know, we do have three children, and giving them a stable, normal, happy life and upbringing is something that is the most important thing to us,\" she said.",

      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketed 3.6%, its biggest one day jump since November 2022. The S&P 500 shot up 2.5% while the Nasdaq climbed nearly 3%.",
      "The biggest winners were companies and sectors that investors are betting will benefit from President-elect Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "Bank stocks, including JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) rallied on the promise of lower taxes and less regulation. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RUT), which includes some regional banks, soared nearly 6%.",
      "It was the biggest surge for the U.S. dollar since 2020, and Carl Icahn, the activist investor and billionaire, said it will lead to less regulation and more mergers and acquisition.",
      "Elon Musk was perhaps the day\u2019s biggest winner. Shares of his Tesla Corporation (TSLA) rocketed nearly 15%. The world\u2019s wealthiest person has been a staunch Trump proponent, donating more than $130 million toward Trump\u2019s election efforts. In his victory speech, the president-elect referred to Musk as a \u201csuper genius\u201d and has promised him a role in his administration.",
      "\u201cThe biggest positive from a Trump win would be for Tesla and Musk,\u201d wrote Dan Ives, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Wedbush. \u201cWe believe a Trump presidency would be an overall negative for the EV industry as likely the EV rebates/tax incentives get pulled. However, for Tesla we see this as a huge positive. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players from flooding the US market,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "The cryptocurrency market also cheered Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) notched a record close, climbing above $75,000. Trump has said he wants the U.S. to be the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and plans to create a \u201cstrategic reserve of bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In September, he even launched his own crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Donald Trump saw his personal wealth balloon during Wednesday\u2019s stock market rally, at least on paper. Shares of his Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of his social media platform Truth Social, soared more than 30% at the market\u2019s open but pulled back considerably to finish just 6% higher. Still, that gave the company a market cap of about $7.2 billion, with Trump\u2019s majority stake worth about $4.1 billion.",

      "This is what a second Trump term would mean for health care policies including health insurance and reproductive rights.",
      "Future of the ACA and Medicare",
      "Trump has been inconsistent on what his plans are regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the landmark law signed in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried several times to repeal the ACA but was unsuccessful. In November 2023, he also vowed to replace it in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Since then, he has shifted course. In March, Trump said is \"not running to terminate\" the ACA but said he wanted to make it \"better\" and \"less expensive,\" in a post on Truth Social.",
      "During the September presidential debate, he said he had \"concepts of a plan\" and said it would be \"better health care than Obamacare,\" but offered few details.",
      "There could also be changes to Medicare, a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 or older and younger people with disabilities.",
      "Trump has promoted Medicare Advantage, which is run by commercial insurers. What's more, Project 2025 -- a plan of conservative policy proposals proposed by the Heritage Foundation and not endorsed by Trump -- has proposed Medicare Advantage be the default option for Medicare coverage.",
      "Experts have said this could privatize the program and prevent people from receiving care from doctors and hospitals that don't accept Medicare Advantage.",
      "Also at risk are those with pre-existing conditions. Under the ACA, insurers cannot charge more or deny coverage to someone or their child because of a pre-existing health condition.

      "In an interview with NPR on Wednesday morning, Kennedy doubled down on his promise that the Trump administration will recommend that local governments remove fluoride from their water supplies.",
      "He has claimed that fluoride in drinking water affects children's neurological development and that other countries which have removed fluoride from their water supplies have not seen an increase in cavities.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says fluoride prevents cavities and repairs damage to teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth. Fluoride also replaces minerals lost from teeth due to acid breakdown, according to the agency.",
      "Additionally, Kennedy told NPR he would work \"immediately\" to increase research into the safety of vaccines, though he insisted, \"We're not going to take vaccines away from anybody.\"",
      "\"We are going to make sure that Americans have good information,\" he said. \"Right now, the science on vaccine safety, particularly, has huge deficits in it.

    "summary": "While ABC News had not projected a winner by early Wednesday morning, Trump's performance broke the mold across a variety of measures.",
    "story": [
      "ABC News has not projected a winner in the presidential race.",
      "Former President Donald Trump leveraged economic discontent, extended his appeal beyond his core support groups and overturned long-term political trends in the 2024 presidential election, driving his unique political style to a remarkable comeback.",
      "While ABC News had not projected a winner by early Wednesday morning, Trump's performance broke the mold across a variety of measures.",
      "Among them, Hispanic voters, long a solidly Democratic group, voted for Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by just 53-45% -- the closest margin since exit polls began in 1976. That 8-point win for Harris compares with 33 points for President Joe Biden among Hispanic voters four years ago.",
      "Trump's gain chiefly was among Hispanic men -- a win by 10 points, after losing them by 23 points in 2020. Given the country's increasingly diverse population, Republican competitiveness among Hispanic voters could represent a sea change in the nation's political landscape.",
      "At the same time, diversity declined in this election: It was the first time since 1996 that racial and ethnic minorities did not increase their share of the electorate, even if by a scant point or two. In all, they went from just 13% of voters in 1992 (with the rest, 87%, white) to 33% in 2020 (with 67% white). In this election, white voters accounted for 71%, a 4-point increase; minority voters moved down to 29%.",
      "The main gain among white people was those who don't have a four-year college degree, +4 points as a share of the electorate and a broadly pro-Trump group.",
      "White people overall voted 55-43% for Trump. That compared with Harris wins of 53-45% among Hispanic people (an historically tight margin, as noted) 56-38% among Asian voters and 86-12% among Black voters, a typical result for Democrats.",
      "Another break from the past was in terms of straight-ahead partisanship. Thirty-four percent of voters identified themselves as Republicans, 32% as Democrats and 34% as independents. However tight the margin, it was the first time in exit polls that Republicans outnumbered Democrats nationally.",
      "There was a huge gap between young men (roughly evenly split, 49-47%, Harris-Trump) and young women (+27 points for Harris, 63-36%). Still, Harris' vote from young women was down 4 points from Biden's in 2020.",
      "Harris won women by 54-44%; Trump won men by an identical margin. That 20-point gender gap almost exactly matches the average since 1996. Tellingly, though, Harris' support from women was 3 points lower than Biden's in 2020.",
      "In another dramatic shift, Harris underperformed Biden by 19 points among first-time voters (even if a small group, 8% of the electorate). They went 54-45% for Trump over Harris, after backing Biden over Trump by 64-32%. Trump doubled his support in this group.",
      "College-educated voters were about as good for Harris as they were for Biden \u2013 but Trump did 4 points better among non-college voters than he did four years ago. Non-college voters, notably, are more economically vulnerable: Fifty-three percent in that group said they'd gotten worse off financially under Biden's presidency. Just 33% of college-educated voters said the same.",
      "One more departure in the 2024 election bears note: Even with her overall outcome, independent voters went 49-46 percent Harris-Trump. Independents often \u2013 but not always \u2013 vote with the winner.",
      "On issues, the most striking result by far was the share of people overall saying they've gotten worse off financially under the current administration, 45%. That was the highest in exit polls that have asked the question, even surpassing the 42% worse off in 2008, in the teeth of the Great Recession. It was up from 20% four years ago, a more than doubling of the worse-off population under the administration in which Harris is No 2.",
      "Conversely, a mere 24% this year said they'd become better off under Biden, a question Trump asked repeatedly at his campaign rallies.",
      "Biden took the heat, with just a 40% job approval rating, with 58% disapproving, the lowest approval for an incumbent president in exit polls since President George W. Bush's 27% as he left office in 2008.",
      "But Harris took the heat, as well.",
      "Brief state-by-state results from exit polls in the seven battleground states follow.",
      "Arizona",
      "Biden narrowly won in Arizona four years ago helped by gains among college-educated white voters and among a growing share of independents. This year Harris maintained Biden\u2019s advantage with college-educated white voters, winning them by 53-45%. But independents, 40% of voters, split 49-45%, Trump-Harris.",
      "In another key result, Maricopa County voters divided 50-47%, Trump-Harris, compared with 50-48%, Biden-Trump, in 2020. Maricopa County is crucial, as it's home to 59% of the state\u2019s electorate.",
      "Georgia",
      "Harris was unable to replicate Biden\u2019s performance among independents that helped make him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry Georgia since 1992.",
      "Key to Trump\u2019s victory here, independents swung toward Trump by 11 points, 54-43%, compared with Biden\u2019s 9-point margin in 2020. Trump also won white men with college degrees by 30 points, 64-34%, more than doubling his 12-point lead among them 2020. And although he lost moderates to Harris by 18 points, that was far narrower than his 32-point loss against Biden in 2020.",
      "Michigan",
      "In 2020, Biden flipped Michigan back to the Democratic column by making gains from Clinton's 2016 showing among independents, suburbanites and those in union households.",
      "In key shifts this year, under-30s divided 51-46% Trump-Harris, a sharp turn from Biden's 24-point advantage (61-37%) in this group in 2020. In partisan terms, the share identifying as Democrats fell 6 points to 32%, the lowest on record in exit polls since 1984.",
      "Nevada",
      "In a stronger-than-usual showing among Hispanic voters, Trump divided evenly with Harris in this group, 47-47%; Democrats had 21- to 54-point advantages among Hispanic voters in Nevada exit poll data since 2000.",
      "Other factors kept the race up in the air. Independents divided evenly, 47-46%; as did white women, a group Trump won by 53-45% in 2020.",
      "But Trump eroded usual Democratic margins in Las Vegas\u2019 Clark County, splitting the vote, 49-48%, Harris-Trump, the best showing for a GOP presidential candidate in available exit poll data since 2004.",
      "North Carolina",
      "Trump was aided in North Carolina by the broad 69% of voters who rated the national economy negatively \u2013 a group that supported him by 46 points over Harris, 72-26%. His economic message cut across racial lines. A third of voters were people of color, and 60% of them gave the nation\u2019s economy bad ratings; they went for Trump by 26 points, 61-35%.",
      "Trump lost 4 points vs. 2020 among white voters, while Harris gained 5 points over Biden\u2019s margin. Still, that wasn\u2019t enough to mitigate slips in groups that brought Biden close in 2020. Voters under 30 went +1 for Harris this year vs. +17 for Biden in 2020, men went +17 for Trump vs. +9 for him in 2020 and Black voters went for Harris by +74 points this time, down from Biden's +85.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "Exit poll results in Pennsylvania pointed to a growing educational divide, with Harris leading by 60-39% among voters with a college degree, the widest Democratic win in this group in exit polls since 1988. Conversely, Trump had a 57-41% lead among non-college voters, the largest Republican victory on record. The gender gap also sharpened since 2020, with women breaking for Harris by 55-43% while men went for Trump by 57-41%.",
      "Harris made inroads among voters from union households, winning them by 54-45% after this group split 51-49% for Trump in 2020. But, as elsewhere, she lost ground among Hispanic voters, +15 points at the end of night, compared with Biden\u2019s 42-point lead in 2020; and among voters younger than 30, winning them by 9 points compared with Biden\u2019s 27 points.",

      "Harris lost ground among Wisconsin voters younger than 30; they went 53-45 Harris-Trump compared with a 59-36 percent Biden win four years ago. While they comprised just 6% of the electorate, Black voters went for Harris by 78-21%, down from a much wider 92-8% for Biden in 2020. At the same time, Harris was boosted by an increase in the share of voters with college degrees, up 4 points from 2020 to 38%; she won them 57-41%, matching Biden\u2019s margin in 2020. The share of moderates also increased, up 6 points to 44%, with this group breaking 56-43% Harris-Trump.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts.",
      "When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target.",
      "These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.",
      "Here are some of the measures.",
      "This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming years.",
      "It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty. One major way it does so is by giving credits to businessespeople who build new solar and wind farms.",
      "But it's not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as long as they don't earn too much to qualify.",
      "Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats\u2019 \u201cgreen new scam\u201d in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change.",
      "He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the landmark 2022 climate law.",
      "If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing, because it is perceived as \u201cAmerica first and pro-U.S. business,\u201d said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he added.",
      "In a call Wednesday morning, Scott Segal, head of a communications group at the law firm Bracewell LLP, which represents the energy industry, said the climate law is not likely to be repealed.",
      "Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown, said repealing parts of the climate law could backfire because most of the investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts.",
      "The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing the climate change that comes from making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard said.",
      "It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-controlled states have filed legal challenges to a host of EPA rules including this one and Trump\u2019s victory means the Justice Department is unlikely to defend it.",
      "Under a Trump presidency, it is unlikely to survive, Shepheard said.",
      "The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "\u201cI hope that we don\u2019t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the climate. It\u2019s about our lives and our health.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger hurricanes \u2014 methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too expensive to transport.",
      "The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-leaning states have challenged the rule in court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards.",
      "The EPA said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks under the Biden administration.",
      "While it is unclear who will head the EPA under Trump, the agency is considered likely to begin a lengthy process to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle \u201cmandate.\u2033 Trump rolled back more than 100 environmental laws as president and that number is likely to grow in a second term.",
      "Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don\u2019t work in cold weather and aren\u2019t able to travel long distances. Trump softened his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.",
      "Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars.",
      "Trump is almost certain to reinstate oil drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears, caribou and other wildlife. Trump opened the area to drilling in a 2017 tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. No drilling has occurred in the refuge, although the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday proposed a lease sale by the end of December that could lead to oil drilling. The sale is required under the 2017 law.",
      "Trump, who has cast climate change as a \u201choax,\u201d has said he will also eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.",
      "Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate action will continue to move forward at the state and local level.",
      "Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the federal level on climate, she\u2019s optimistic that states including California will continue to lead.",
      "Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said on Wednesday that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record installations of wind and solar energy.",
      "Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said.",
      "Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden\u2019s first national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power.",
      "\u201cNo matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,\u2033 McCarthy said. Advocates for clean energy are bipartisan, well-organized \u201cand fully prepared to deliver climate solutions, boost local economies, and drive climate ambition,\u2032 she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 14:00:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr -- the state's first openly trans lawmaker -- ran for reelection to the state House after she was censured.",
    "story": [
      "Zephyr was censured over her protests against a trans youth care ban.",
      "Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr -- the first openly trans lawmaker in the state -- has won her bid for reelection to the Montana House of Representatives after she was censured and barred from the House floor for almost two years. Her win allows Zephyr to take to the House floor for debate once more.",
      "Zephyr's censure stemmed from her pleas on the House floor against a gender-affirming care ban for transgender youth.",
      "\"If you are denying gender-affirming care and forcing a trans child to go through puberty, that is tantamount to torture, and this body should be ashamed,\" Zephyr said in the April 18, 2023 debate. \"If you vote yes on this bill, I hope the next time you bow your heads in prayer, you see the blood on your hands.\"",
      "She later elaborated on the comments in an April 2023 interview with ABC News, arguing that gender-affirming support and care improves the mental health of trans children, who face higher rates of discrimination and bullying.",
      "\"I have lost friends to suicide this year,\" Zephyr said. \"I've had families call me when there have been ... suicide attempts by trans youth, including one trans teenager who attempted to take her life watching one of these hearings on legislation targeting the transgender community.\"",
      "Republican lawmakers responded to her comments on the House floor by refusing to allow her to speak or comment on the House floor, she said. Some legislators, including House Speaker Matt Regier, argued she had broken House rules of decorum.",
      "Demonstrators in support of Zephyr interrupted House business several days later to protest her silencing, and she showed her support by holding up her mic.",
      "\"Let her speak,\" protesters chanted.",
      "House Republicans voted to censure her in response, representing just over the two-thirds needed to bar her from the House floor.",
      "\"All representatives are free to participate in House debate while following the House rules. The choice to not follow House rules is one that Representative Zephyr has made,\" said Regier in a statement to reporters following the censure. \"The only person silencing Representative Zephyr is Representative Zephyr.\"",
      "Several of her colleagues argued that Zephyr was inciting \"violence\" and showing \"flagrant disregard for the safety and well-being\" of those at the House, according to one statement from the Montana Freedom Caucus.",
      "Zephyr argued the real violence is the negative impact gender-affirming care bans may have on transgender youth.",
      "The day after her censure, Zephyr could be found seated in the public area of the state capitol building, voting and participating with her laptop as close to the House floor as she was allowed.",
      "\"The people sent me here to do the work, and much of that work is on the House floor,\" she told ABC News at the time. \"I need to be as close as possible, so I can have the conversations with legislators and make sure that I can, at least in some way, make sure the voice of my constituents can be discussed.\"",
      "Zephyr filed a lawsuit against the state, Regier and Sergeant at Arms for the Montana House of Representatives Bradley Murfitt in an attempt to reinstate her legislative privileges and duties. The lawsuit was dismissed.",
      "\"The recent actions violate my 1st amendment rights, as well as the rights of my 11,000 constituents to representation,\" Zephyr said in a tweet Monday. \"Montana's State House is the people's House, not Speaker Regier's, and I'm determined to defend the right of the people to have their voices heard.\"",
      "Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen's office, which represented the state against the lawsuit, denounced the effort as \"political activism masquerading as a lawsuit.\"",
      "\"The ACLU is trying to use the courts to interfere with the legislature as it carries out its constitutional duties on behalf of Montanans,\" said Emily Flower, Knudsen's press secretary. \"Any relief granted by the court would be a gross violation of the separation of powers.\"",

    "summary": "How big will the Republicans' U.S. Senate majority be?",
    "story": [
      "How big will their majority be?",
      "We entered Election Day filled with ample uncertainty, but one thing we could say with relative confidence was that Republicans were clear favorites to gain control of the U.S. Senate. Helped out by former President Donald Trump's edge in most (if not all) of the seven pivotal swing states, the GOP appears to have done more than just grab control \u2014 the party could have its largest majority in at least a decade, if not more.",
      "As of early this morning, ABC News has projected Republican gains in three states, while Republican candidates hold the lead in two other seats currently held by Democrats. In addition, no GOP-held seats are projected to change hands, so the GOP should move to at least a four-seat edge in the Senate, with several more opportunities to add to the GOP caucus as returns continue to roll in.",
      "Entering this election, Democrats held a wafer-thin 51-to-49 seat majority in the Senate, aided by the four independents who caucus with them. That meant the GOP needed a net gain of one seat to get to a 50-50 tie \u2014 in which case the party controlling the vice presidency would control the Senate \u2014 or two seats to attain outright control. Helpfully for them, Republicans had a number of juicy pickup opportunities, including three Democratic-held seats in states that former President Donald Trump carried in 2016, 2020 and, as it turned out, in 2024, too. Meanwhile, Democrats had few realistic possibilities of gaining ground from the GOP. Understandably, 538's final Senate forecast gave Republicans slightly better than a 9-in-10 shot of winning the chamber.",
      "Republicans got their 50th seat with their easiest pickup of the night in West Virginia, where the retirement of Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin all but ensured a GOP flip in the Mountain State. Popular Republican Gov. Jim Justice appears to have cruised to landslide victory, as he's ahead of Democrat Glenn Elliott 69 percent to 28 percent. In a state that Trump is carrying by more than 40 percentage points, this was anything but a surprise.",
      "The 51st seat for Republicans came in Ohio. Republican Bernie Moreno is projected to defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown: With 95 percent of the expected vote reporting, Moreno currently holds a 50 percent to 46 percent lead. Brown ran ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris, who trails Trump 55 percent to 44 percent in Ohio, but the incumbent couldn\u2019t capture enough Trump voters to hold onto his seat.",
      "Republicans are also projected to win in Montana, the third red-state seat held by Democrats. There, Republican Tim Sheehy leads Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by around 8 points, 53 percent to 45 percent (with 88 percent of the expected vote reporting). Like Brown, Tester also ran ahead of Harris, who has won only about 38 percent in Big Sky Country.",
      "And it looks like perhaps as many as four other Democratic-held seats are in play for Republicans. As of this writing, Republican Mike Rogers narrowly trails Democrat Elissa Slotkin by less than 1 point in Michigan, with about 4 percent of the expected vote outstanding. In Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick leads Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr. by less than 1 point, 49.1 percent to 48.3 percent, with 4 percent of the expected vote remaining to be counted. In Nevada, Republican Sam Brown holds a very narrow edge over Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen with around 88 percent of the expected vote reporting. Republicans could even compete for Arizona, although Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego leads Republican Kari Lake by about 2 percentage points even as Trump holds a slim edge in the state, with more than 60 percent of the expected vote reporting. One bright spot for Democrats: In Wisconsin's competitive seat, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin currently holds a lead of just under 1 percentage point with 99 percent of the expected vote reporting, even as Trump is projected to narrowly carry the state.",
      "As we discussed in our introduction to the Senate forecast in October, the GOP is going to have a good shot at retaining this majority, too, unless Democrats can win in some places where they've come up short in recent years. In 2026, Republicans are only defending one seat in a state that Trump looks likely to lose in this election (Maine), while only a couple of other seats are in red states that perhaps could be competitive in a midterm cycle (North Carolina and, at least based on 2018, Texas). Then in 2028, Democrats have to defend swing-state or potentially competitive seats in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the GOP will only be defending two seats that year that look potentially endangered based on their recent history: North Carolina and Wisconsin.",
      "Some things will inevitably change based on the public's response to the next Congress and Trump's second term as president. Democrats may have opportunities we don't currently see. But if Republicans end up with 55 or more seats after this election, that will be their largest majority since they reached the 55-seat mark in the 2004 election.",

Read\u2019s attorneys argue she is being framed and that other law enforcement officers are responsible for O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. A judge declared a mistrial in June after finding jurors couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. A retrial on the same charges is set to begin in January, though both sides asked Monday for it to be delayed until April. 1.",
      "\u201cToday's appeal goes to the core issues regarding double jeopardy protection that safeguard defendants, in this case Ms. Read, from the risk of reprosecution for the very same offenses for which a prior jury was discharged,\u201d Read\u2019s attorney, Martin Weinberg, told judges at the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.",
      "Weinberg went onto to say four jurors and fifth indirectly came forward after her mistrial to say that they were deadlocked only on a manslaughter count and had agreed that she wasn\u2019t guilty on the other charges of charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. But they hadn\u2019t told the judge.",
      "As a result of the the revelations about the jurors, Weinberg argued for the court to allow holding of an a evidentiary hearing where jurors could be asked whether they had reached final not guilty verdicts on any charges.",
      "The judges questioned Weinberg over the the merits for holding inquiry. Associate Justice Frank Gaziano noting that such inquiries are usually reserved for \u201cextraneous information\u201d such as \u201cracisms in the jury room\" while Chief Justice Kimberly Budd wondered about the limits of allowing an inquiry, which she suggested could open the door for other defendants to argue a juror came to them to say \u201c that's not really what happened.\u201d",
      "Other justices raised concerns about juries having to discuss their deliberations during an inquiry while others questioned the merits of holding an inquiry when three notes from the juror made it clear they were at an impasse.",
      "\u201cYou have an exhausted jury writing this very eloquent message saying we've done our best, we haven't been able a verdict on the charges,\u201d Justice Scott Kafker said. \u201cThere is no inkling in that that they have reached verdicts on charges or that this only relates to the second charge.\u201d",
      "Weinberg also argued that Judge Beverly Cannone abruptly announced the mistrial in court without first asking each juror to confirm their conclusions about each count or to give defense counsel a chance to weigh in.",
      "But Associate Justice Serge Georges said Read had seasoned defense attoreys who must have sensed that a mistrial was possible when Cannon gave juries what is called Tuey-Rodriguez charge, a last ditch effort to get them to reconsider their positions before a mistrial was declared.",
      "\u201cThere isn't any lawyer that's worth their salt that wouldn't think they might get a mistrial on this,\" George said, pushing back on the contention that the defense didn't have an opportunity to be heard. \u201cHow do we factor in that you've got to know that is going to be on the table, a mistrial. What obligation is there on counsel to say, hey, before you declare a mistrial, let's talk about alternatives to that.\u201d",
      "In August, a judge ruled Read can be retried on those charges. \u201cWhere there was no verdict announced in open court here, retrial of the defendant does not violate the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d the judge, Beverly Cannone, said in her ruling.",
      "Prosecutors have maintained that there\u2019s no basis for dismissing the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of the accident. In court, they argued defense counsel should have sensed a mistrial was \u201cinevitable or unavoidable\u201d and that they had every opportunity to be heard.",
      "Still, Gaziano asked Assistant District Attorney Caleb Schillinger whether Cannone had \u201ceither the discretion or an obligation to ask the jury after the last note about continued deliberatios or a verdict on any lesser included offense.\u201d",
      "Schillinger responded that Cannone had no obligation to question the jurors further, though he acknowledged she had discretion. But argued the Cannone had \u201cno doubt\u201d basd on the juries note that they \"had not reached agreement on any charges\" and that probing further risked coercing the jury into reaching a verdict.",
      "\u201cYou have a jury that has sat through a gruelling 10-week trial, nearly 100 witnesses, hundreds of exhibits now four or five days of deliberation,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cThey've returned three times indicating they are deadlocked at an impasses and they do not want to continue to deliberate.\u201d",
      "But George said Schillinger's argument lent support to the idea of Cannone telling defense attorneys about the last note and getting their thoughts.",
      "\u201cYou've spent a lot of time, energy and money, anxiety, angst in this trial,\u201d George said. \u201cWhy wouldn't we talk about what potentially we could do short of saying mistrial, let's start again.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, and O\u2019Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police, had been drinking heavily before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow Boston officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away. An autopsy found O\u2019Keefe had died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.",
      "The defense portrayed Read as the victim, saying O\u2019Keefe was actually killed inside Albert\u2019s home and then dragged outside. They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a \u201cconvenient outsider\u201d who saved them from having to consider law enforcement officers as suspects."

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "The Republican challenger has conceded after a close contest for North Carolina's only toss-up congressional district",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout conceded the race for North Carolina's only toss-up congressional district on Wednesday following a tight, closely watched race against incumbent first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis.",
      "The Associated Press has not yet called the race. With the vast majority of precincts reporting, Davis and Buckhout were separated by a narrow margin in one of the few competitive districts across the Southeast.",
      "Buckhout issued a statement on X announcing her loss and calling on Davis to work with President-elect Donald Trump's administration on immigration and economic issues. She said she phoned Davis early Wednesday to congratulate him on \u201chis hard-fought victory.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile Don and I have different visions, it is obvious to everyone he cares about this district,\u201d she said.",
      "Davis also put out a statement declaring victory and thanking his supporters. He said he looks forward to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in his second term.",
      "\u201cI'm wholeheartedly dedicated to understanding and addressing the challenges and aspirations over everyday citizens in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "The contest between Davis and Buckhout has attracted millions of dollars from both parties to either flip or maintain the district, which extends from Currituck County to a small portion of Granville County in the state's northeast.",
      "The district's political landscape is a bit different for Davis compared to when he defeated Republican opponent Sandy Smith in 2022. Last year, the GOP-controlled state legislature added a handful of conservative-leaning counties to the district, making it less blue than it once was.",
      "Davis was born and raised in Snow Hill and has held various political positions in the region, including as his hometown's mayor and a state senator. He also is a U.S. Air Force veteran.",
      "Buckhout served in the U.S. Army for more than 25 years before retiring and starting a Virginia-based military technology consulting company. She sold the company and moved to Edenton a few years ago.",
      "Both Davis and Buckhout have sought to tie each other to the unpopular policies or controversial behaviors of other candidates in their respective parties.",
      "Buckhout's campaign has repeatedly tried to tie Davis with Vice President Kamala Harris' economic and immigration policies as a way to win over voters dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration. Davis voted with House Republicans in July to condemn Harris' work at the U.S.-Mexico border, then endorsed her presidential run a day later. He has also campaigned with her, speaking at one of her rallies in Greenville in October.",
      "Democratic groups supporting Davis, meanwhile, have tried to draw connections between Buckhout and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, whose gubernatorial campaign has been fighting back against a CNN report alleging that he made several graphic sexual and racist comments on an online pornography forum about a decade ago. Robinson has denied the claims, and The Associated Press has not independently verified them.",
      "Those groups also have used photos in which Buckhout appears with Robinson to tie her to the lieutenant governor's shifting stance on abortion restrictions. Buckhout has previously said that she's focused on her own race rather than Robinson's."

And Trump appeared on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for the White House \u2014 even after two impeachments, felony convictions and his attempt to overturn his previous election loss.",
      "Despite her stark warnings about Trump, Harris reached for optimism on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it\u2019s going to be OK,\" she told supporters as some of them wiped tears from their eyes.",
      "Biden released a statement praising Harris after her speech, saying: \u201cShe will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, was in the audience with his family. So were Reps. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, and Barbara Lee, both from Harris\u2019 home state of California.",
      "Before her speech, Harris called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. She told the crowd that \u201cwe will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,\" an implicit reference to Trump's unwillingness to do the same four years ago.",
      "Some in the audience expressed disappointment that Harris was not able to make history as the country's first Black female president. Harris would also have been first U.S. president of South Asian descent",
      "Gregory Pate, 38, said he appreciated that Harris said she was \"committed to the fight and not looking at this as a permanent defeat, but just another obstacle that we have to go through as Black people.\u201d",
      "\"I think it was perfect. I think that it was timely, and it was a message that I came to hear,\u201d said Pate, of Fairfax, Virginia.",
      "Jay Evans, of Greenbelt, Maryland, said after Harris' spoke that he's wistful for what could have been.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re partly sad, because hearing her speak, she would have been an amazing person to bring the country together and to keep us in a better path,\u201d Evans said.",
      "After Trump lost to Biden, he directed his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol, leading to a violent insurrection that interrupted the ceremonial certification of the election results.",
      "Now Harris is expected to oversee the same certification process to finalize Trump's victory as voters brush off concerns about the future of American democracy and return the former Republican president to the White House.",
      "Biden plans to address the election results on Thursday. The White House said he spoke with Harris and Trump on Wednesday, and he invited the president-elect to meet with him soon.",
      "David Plouffe, a top Harris adviser, said campaign staffers \u201cleft it all on the field for their country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe dug out of a deep hole but not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cA devastating loss.\"",
      "Harris became the Democratic candidate after Biden, who was already struggling to convince voters that he could serve as president until he was 86 years old, stumbled badly in his June 27 debate with Trump.",
      "He dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy.",
      "It was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign had flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed \u201cthe female Barack Obama.\u201d Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.",
      "Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party's future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House's leading advocate for abortion rights.",
      "Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden's departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket.",
      "But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden's political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change.",
      "Although Harris pitched \"a new way forward,\" she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary.",
      "Democrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it's unclear what role Harris will play in her party's future.",
      "\u201cThe work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,\" wrote Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign chair, in a letter to staff. \"I know the Vice President isn\u2019t finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.\u201d"

      "A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid",
      "WASHINGTON -- A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said Wednesday.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "Unless government prosecutors or others attempt to challenge the plea deals again, McCall's ruling means that the three 9/11 defendants before long could enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, taking a dramatic step toward wrapping up the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the risk of the death penalty in exchange for the guilty pleas.",
      "Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had approved the agreements.",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others after they were made public this summer.",
      "Within days, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary.",
      "The New York Times first reported the ruling.",
      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. However, a legal blog that long has covered the prosecutions from the Guantanamo courtroom said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals.",
      "The ruling also calls the timing of Austin's move \u201cfatal,\u201d coming after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals, according to the blog, called Lawdragon.",
      "Abiding by Austin\u2019s order would give defense secretaries \u201cabsolute veto power\u201d over any act they disagree with, which would be contrary to the independence of the presiding official over the Guantanamo trials, the law blog quotes McCall as saying in the ruling.",
      "While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it's not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals.",
      "The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin\u2019s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by \u201cclean teams\u201d of FBI agents that did not involve violence.",

      "U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes has won reelection to a second term representing a northeast Ohio district targeted by Republicans, but fellow Democrat Marcy Kaptur\u2019s race remains too early to call",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes won reelection to a second term representing a northeast Ohio district targeted by Republicans, but fellow Democrat Marcy Kaptur's race remained too early to call Wednesday.",
      "Sykes, 38, defeated Republican Kevin Coughlin in a district centered on her native Akron, where she comes from a family steeped in state politics. Her father, Vern, is a sitting state senator and her mother, Barbara, is a former state lawmaker and statewide candidate.",
      "\u201cI want to congratulate Congresswoman Sykes on her re-election,\u201d Coughlin tweeted Wednesday morning. \u201cWhile the result is not what we had hoped for, the values that drove this campaign \u2014 safety, security, and affordability \u2014 will still motivate us to create change.\u201d",
      "Sykes still awaits a tie-breaking decision on whether an 11th hour challenge to her residency will proceed.",
      "A political activist challenged her residency in the days before the election on grounds that her husband, Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce, had listed Sykes as a member of his household in Columbus. Sykes called the allegation that she doesn\u2019t maintain residence in Akron \u201ca deeply offensive lie.\u201d",
      "The Summit County Board of Elections tied 2-2 along party lines on Oct. 24 on whether the challenge should be taken up. Board members had 14 days to deliver details of its disagreement to Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who then, the law states, \u201cshall summarily decide the question.\u201d",
      "Kaptur, 78, had a slight lead over Ohio state Rep. Derek Merrin and declared victory based on leading the vote count in the wee hours of Wednesday, but The Associated Press has not called that race. Mail-in, overseas and military ballots have until Saturday to be returned.",
      "Kaptur entered the election cycle as among the most vulnerable congressional incumbents in the country. Her race for Ohio\u2019s 9th Congressional District attracted some $23 million in spending, as challenger Derek Merrin, a fourth-term state representative, won the backing of both House Speaker Mike Johnson and Donald Trump, the former and future president.",
      "Her campaign cast her as overcoming \u201cmillions in outside spending from dark-money super PACs,\u201d and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee congratulated Kaptur as \u201ca proven champion for the Midwest.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs the longest serving woman in Congress, Marcy has never forgotten where she came from and never stopped fighting for Northwest Ohio,\u201d chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement. \"She is a one-of-a-kind legislator, and leaders like her are few and far between. We are all better off with her in office.\u201d",
      "The two parties spent more than $23 million in ads on the race between the March 19 primary and Tuesday, according to AdImpact, which tracks campaign spending. Democrats had a slight edge, spending more than $12 million to Republicans\u2019 $11 million. Merrin received more support from outside GOP groups than Kaptur, who spent about $3.7 million of her own campaign funds on the race after the primary.",
      "A loss for Merrin would mark a rare failure of Trump's endorsement to lift a favored candidate to victory in the state, which he has won three times and stripped of its bellwether status. It worked to elect both U.S. Sen. JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, and Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, who unseated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown on Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin won Michigan\u2019s shotgun-tight race for U.S. Senate, defeating former Republican congressman Mike Rogers in a battle of attrition",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin won Michigan's razor's-edge race for U.S. Senate, defeating former Republican congressman Mike Rogers in a battle of attrition. In the end, Slotkin carried the state after there were not enough ballots left to be counted for Rogers to overtake her roughly 18,000-vote lead when The Associated Press called the race at 3:12 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "The outcome was a reversal of fortune for Rogers, who jumped out to a significant early lead that continued into Wednesday's early hours. But population-dense Democratic strongholds, including Wayne County, home to Detroit, still had large amounts of ballots to count. And as Wednesday wore on, Slotkin improved her standing by winning many of the subsequent updates as election officials continued to tabulate the vote and release new numbers.",
      "Though the race is tight, Rogers would need to collect over 64 percent of the remaining vote to overtake Slotkin's lead. His campaign has not said whether he will request a recount, which he is allowed to do under Michigan law.",
      "Slotkin joined Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin in holding two \u201cblue wall\u201d Senate seats for Democrats in states that Trump won.",

      "WINNER: Slotkin",
      "POLL CLOSING TIME: 8 p.m. & 9 p.m. ET.",
      "ABOUT THE RACE:",
      "There was a time in the not-too-distant past when Republicans were a dominant force in Michigan, controlling the governor\u2019s office and both chambers of the Legislature while holding a majority of the state\u2019s congressional seats. But they have long struggled when it came to the U.S. Senate. This year was no exception, though the came close.",
      "Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, has been a strong campaigner throughout her career in Congress. Rogers, meanwhile, was coaxed out of retirement in Florida to run. The race determined who would replace longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, whose decision to retire after five terms had turned what was once a safe seat into a pickup opportunity for Republicans. The GOP reclaimed a three vote Senate majority, but a win in Michigan would have helped pad their numbers.",
      "Rogers, the former House Intelligence Committee chairman, gave Michigan Republicans a chance to end their 24-year drought in races for U.S. Senate. Though Rogers served Michigan in the House for years, he retired to the Miami area and has been accused by Democrats of allowing his Michigan ties to atrophy.",
      "The Republican Party in Michigan is also in disarray, with a pro-Trump faction often feuding with the state\u2019s moderate, pro-business establishment that was once the party\u2019s secret to success in the state. That success, however, evaporated several years ago, when Democrats reclaimed the governor\u2019s office, the Legislature and a majority of congressional seats.",
      "Rogers nearly overcame that drama.",
      "WHY AP CALLED THE RACE: Slotkin led by about 18,700 votes when AP called the race after determining there weren\u2019t enough votes left to count that would allow Rogers to catch up. Rogers had led before late-reporting votes from Wayne, home to Detroit, and other big Democratic-leaning counties lifted Slotkin ahead. She joined Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin in holding two Blue Wall Senate seats for Democrats.",

      "Some Democratic officials expressed relief that their numbers didn\u2019t diminish as Republicans enjoyed big wins nationally, with former President Donald Trump winning a second term and the GOP winning control of the U.S. Senate. In Tennessee, Trump and Republican U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn both ran up their margins to almost 30 percentage points, outpacing their previous statewide elections.",
      "Blackburn defeated state Rep. Gloria Johnson.

      "With the GOP ranks unharmed, Republican Gov. Bill Lee and legislative leaders wasted no time restarting their push for a universal school voucher program. On Wednesday, Lee and other key lawmakers unveiled a voucher proposal that would allow families to use public funds for private school tuition.",
      "Lee had pitched a sweeping voucher proposal earlier this year, but abandoned it due to Republican infighting over how it would be implemented.",
      "It's unclear if he'll have more consensus in 2025. Lee took the extra step during the August primary election of endorsing Republican school choice proponents, and none of those candidates lost on Tuesday.",
      "In neighboring Kentucky on Tuesday, voters soundly rejected a voucher-style ballot measure intended to allow state lawmakers to allocate public tax dollars to support students attending private or charter schools.",

      "The investigation into the stolen and forged ballots was announced by Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold last month.",
      "At the time, she said at least 12 mailed ballots were stolen in Mesa County and sent in with fraudulent votes, three of which slipped past county election officials and were counted for the election that ended Tuesday. Because ballots themselves are not signed, once they are removed from the signature envelope, there is no way to identify them.",
      "According to the arrest affidavits, victims are still being located and confirmed, and investigators believe there could be over 20 people whose ballots were stolen.",
      "Mesa County is where former county clerk Tina Peters was recently sentenced to prison for a data-breach scheme spawned from false claims about voter machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race."

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "NEW YORK -- A man charged with fraud for claiming to own a storied Manhattan hotel where he had been living rent-free for years has been found unfit to stand trial, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "Doctors examining Mickey Barreto deemed he's not mentally competent to face criminal charges, and prosecutors confirmed the results during a court hearing Wednesday, according to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.",
      "Judge Cori Weston gave Barreto until Nov. 13. to find suitable inpatient psychiatric care, Bragg's office said.",
      "Barreto had been receiving outpatient treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues, but doctors concluded after a recent evaluation that he did not fully understand the criminal proceedings, the New York Times first reported.",
      "Barreto dismissed the allegations of a drug problem to some \u201cpartying,\u201d and said prosecutors are trying to have him hospitalized because they did not have a strong case against him. He does see some upside.",
      "\u201cIt went from being unfriendly, \u2018He\u2019s a criminal,\u2019 to oh, they don\u2019t talk about crime anymore. Now the main thing is, like, \u2018Oh, poor thing. Finally, we convinced him to go seek treatment,\u2019\u201d Barreto told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "Brian Hutchinson, an attorney for Barreto, didn't immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. But during Wednesday's hearing, he said he planned to ask his client's current treatment provider to accept him, the Times reported.",
      "In February, prosecutors charged Barreto with 24 counts, including felony fraud and criminal contempt.",
      "They say he forged a deed to the New Yorker Hotel purporting to transfer ownership of the entire building to him.",
      "He then tried to charge one of the hotel's tenants rent and demanded the hotel\u2019s bank transfer its accounts to him, among other steps.",
      "Barreto started living at the hotel in 2018 after arguing in court that he had paid about $200 for a one-night stay and therefore had tenant\u2019s rights, based on a quirk of the city's housing laws and the fact that the hotel failed to send a lawyer to a key hearing.",
      "Barreto has said he lived at the hotel without paying any rent because the building\u2019s owners, the Unification Church, never wanted to negotiate a lease with him, but they also couldn\u2019t legally kick him out.",
      "Now, his criminal case may be steering him toward a sort of loophole.",
      "\u201cSo if you ask me if it\u2019s a better thing, in a way it is. Because I\u2019m not being treated as a criminal but I\u2019m treated like a nutjob,\u201d Barreto told the AP.",
      "Built in 1930, the hulking Art Deco structure and its huge red \u201cNew Yorker\u201d sign is an oft-photographed landmark in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Muhammad Ali and other famous boxers stayed there when they had bouts at nearby Madison Square Garden, about a block away. Inventor Nikola Tesla even lived in one of its more than 1,000 rooms for a decade. And NBC broadcasted from its Terrace Room.",
      "But the New Yorker closed as a hotel in 1972 and was used for years for church purposes before part of the building reopened as a hotel in 1994."

      "Special counsel Jack Smith is evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases against Donald Trump before he takes office in light of longstanding Justice Department protocol that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted",
      "WASHINGTON -- Special counsel Jack Smith is evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases against Donald Trump before the president-elect takes office in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.",
      "Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Trump's election defeat of Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no longer face prosecution in accordance with department legal opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in office.",
      "The person familiar with Smith's plans was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.",
      "By moving to wind down the cases before the inauguration in January, Smith and the Justice Department would be averting a potential showdown with Trump, who said as recently as last month that he would fire Smith \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of taking office. It would also mean Trump would enter the White House without the legal cloud of federal criminal prosecutions that once carried the potential for felony convictions and prison sentences.",
      "NBC News first reported Smith's plans.",
      "Smith\u2019s two cases charge Trump in a conspiracy to undo the election results in the run-up to the Capitol riot, and with retaining top secret records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing FBI efforts to recover them. He was appointed to the position in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "The classified documents case has been stalled since July when a Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, dismissed it on grounds that Smith was illegally appointed. Smith has appealed to the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the request to revive the case is pending. Even as Smith looks to withdraw the documents case against Trump, he would seem likely to continue to challenge Cannon's ruling on the legality of his appointment given the precedent such a ruling would create.",
      "In the 2020 election interference case, Trump was scheduled to stand trial in March in Washington, where more than 1,000 of his supporters have been convicted of charges for their roles in the Capitol riot. But the case was halted as Trump pursued his sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution that ultimately landed before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Trump could be emboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in July, which granted former presidents expansive immunity from prosecution for acts taken in the White House and explicitly put off-limits any alleged conduct involving Trump\u2019s discussions with the Justice Department. That included his efforts to use the Justice Department to conduct sham election fraud investigations as part of his bid to stay in power.",
      "The conservative-majority Supreme Court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which of the other allegations in the indictment, if any, could move forward to trial.",
      "In response, Smith\u2019s team last month filed a 165-page brief laying out new evidence to persuade the judge that the actions alleged in the indictment were taken in Trump's private capacity as a candidate \u2014 not as commander-in-chief \u2014 and therefore can remain part of the case. Trump\u2019s lawyers are scheduled to file their response later this month.",
      "In New York, meanwhile, Trump could seek to leverage his newfound status as president-elect in an effort to set aside or expunge his felony conviction and stave off a potential prison sentence.",
      "Trump has been fighting for months to overturn the May 30 verdict, which involves a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. It is the only one of his criminal cases to go to trial.",
      "Tried as a private citizen, his impending return to the White House could compel a court to step in and avoid the unprecedented spectacle of potentially locking up a former and future president.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers haven\u2019t signaled their plans. Before the election, the attorneys were rejected in a bid to move the case from state court to federal court, where he could more easily dispose of it. They are now appealing.",
      "Judge Juan M. Merchan has said he will rule next Tuesday on whether to uphold or toss the verdict in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling that presidents have broad protections from prosecution.",
      "The judge has penciled in Nov. 26 for sentencing, \u201cif necessary.\u201d Punishments range from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.",
      "Though Trump technically has no authority as president to shut down a state-level prosecution like the one in New York, his victory nonetheless calls into question that case as well as a separate pending case in Fulton County, Georgia charging him with plotting to subvert that state\u2019s election in 2020.",

      "Lawyers for Randy Halprin have contended that former Judge Vickers Cunningham in Dallas used racial slurs and antisemitic language to refer to him and some of his co-defendants.",
      "Halprin, 47, was among the group of inmates known as the \u201c Texas 7,\u201d who escaped from a South Texas prison in December 2000 and then committed numerous robberies, including the one in which they shot 29-year-old Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins 11 times, killing him.",
      "By a vote of 6-3, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that Halprin\u2019s conviction be overturned and that he be given a new trial after concluding that Cunningham was biased against him at the time of his trial because he is Jewish.",
      "The appeals court found evidence showed that during his life, Cunningham repeated unsupported antisemitic narratives. When Cunningham became a judge, he continued to use derogatory language about Jewish people outside the courtroom \u201cwith \u2018great hatred, (and) disgust\u2019 and increasing intensity as the years passed,\u201d the court said.",
      "It also said that during Halprin\u2019s trial, Cunningham made offensive antisemitic remarks outside the courtroom about Halprin in particular and Jews in general.",
      "\u201cThe uncontradicted evidence supports a finding that Cunningham formed an opinion about Halprin that derived from an extrajudicial factor \u2014 Cunningham\u2019s poisonous antisemitism,\u201d the appeals court wrote in its ruling.",
      "The court previously halted Halprin\u2019s execution in 2019.",

      "The order for a new trial came after state District Judge Lela Mays in Dallas said in a December 2022 ruling that Cunningham did not or could not curb the influence of his antisemitic bias in his judicial decision-making during the trial.",
      "Mays wrote that Cunningham used racist, homophobic and antisemitic slurs to refer to Halprin and the other escaped inmates.",
      "Cunningham stepped down from the bench in 2005 and is now an attorney in private practice in Dallas. His office said Wednesday that he would not be commenting on Halprin\u2019s case.",

      "U.S. stocks stormed to records as investors made bets on what Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, banks and bitcoin all stormed higher Wednesday as investors made bets on what Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation.",
      "The S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks.",
      "The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean.",
      "\u201cThe markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,\u201d Peter Esho of Esho Capital said.",
      "Of course, how much change Trump effects in his second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that\u2019s still to be determined. That could leave room for snaps back in some of Wednesday\u2019s big knee-jerk movements.",
      "Nevertheless, the market is cleaving between rather clear winners and losers following Trump\u2019s dramatic win. Among them:",
      "Bank stocks led the market higher, in part on hopes that a stronger economy would mean more customers getting loans and paying them back with interest. They also rallied on hopes for lighter regulation from a Republican White House. JPMorgan Chase soared 11.5%, and financial stocks had the biggest gain by far among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market's biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump.",
      "Trump has pledged to make the country \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase\u2019s 31.1% leap.",
      "Musk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president\u2019s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%.",
      "The company behind Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump\u2019s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier.",
      "A Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation\u2019s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%.",
      "Trump\u2019s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500\u2019s gain.",
      "Investors see Trump\u2019s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government\u2019s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It\u2019s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%.",
      "Investors also see Trump\u2019s policies likely adding to future inflation, particularly tariffs, which can add costs to U.S. households\u2019 bills.",
      "\u201cTrump keeps openly telling people that he will increase tariffs not just on China but with every trade partner,\u201d said Andrzej Skiba, head of BlueBay U.S. Fixed Income at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re talking 10% tariffs across all global partners. This is a big deal because this could add 1% to inflation. If you add 1% to next year\u2019s inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts.\u201d",
      "A drop-off in immigration could also mean a crunch of available workers for employers, which could force companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on inflation.",
      "Much of Wall Street\u2019s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, now that inflation seems to be heading back down to its 2% target. Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump and his Republican allies spent months seeding doubt in the integrity of American voting systems and priming supporters to expect a 2024 election riddled with massive and inevitable fraud",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump and his Republican allies had spent months seeding doubt in the integrity of American voting systems and priming supporters to expect a 2024 election riddled with massive and inevitable fraud.",
      "The former president continued laying that groundwork even during a mostly smooth day of voting Tuesday, making unsubstantiated claims related to Philadelphia and Detroit and highlighting concerns about election operations in Milwaukee. Shortly before polls began closing, he took to his social media platform to announce, without providing details, \u201cA lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia.\u201d The declaration produced immediate denials from city leaders who said there was zero evidence of any wrongdoing.",
      "Yet Trump's grim warnings abruptly ended in the later hours of the evening as early returns began tipping in his favor. During his election night speech, the president-elect touted a \u201cmagnificent victory\u201d as he claimed ownership for the favorable results and expressed love for the same states he\u2019d questioned hours earlier.",
      "The messaging pivot was part of a Trump playbook that many in his party have adopted: To preemptively defy a loss with claims of widespread cheating but be ready to quickly disregard them in the event of a win.",
      "In 2020, when he lost to Joe Biden, Trump carried out the other side of that strategy \u2014 spending the following four years doubling down on the false notion that the election was stolen, straining to convince supporters he was the rightful winner. The campaign was successful in changing minds: Polls show that more than half of Republicans still believe Biden was not legitimately elected in 2020.",
      "In the weeks and months leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election, many Trump supporters propped up supposed evidence of fraud that they stopped highlighting when it became clear Trump was in the lead.",
      "Several Republicans in Congress had also fought to require proof of citizenship for voter registration and argued there was no way the election could be fair without that extra layer of security. Yet the biggest proponents of the legislation congratulated Trump overnight without repeating those concerns.",
      "It\u2019s become a common trope to see candidates only focus on claims of potential fraud if they\u2019ve lost or believe they will lose, said David Becker, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who serves as executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s somewhat telling that we\u2019ve seen fewer fraud claims in the aftermath of an election in which former President and future President Trump won,\u201d Becker said Wednesday.",
      "The strategy sets a problematic precedent that \u201cif your preferred candidate doesn't win, it must mean that the entire system is illegitimate,\u201d said Leah Wright Rigueur, a history professor at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "As Republicans have often pointed out, it\u2019s not only their party that has refused to accept races they\u2019ve lost. They often highlight the example of Democratic activist and former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, who ended her 2018 campaign for governor without explicitly conceding defeat to her Republican opponent, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.",
      "Still, Trump is the only American president who has taken steps to try to overturn the results of an election he squarely lost. The part he played in the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, after he urged his supporters to \u201cfight like hell,\u201d has been condemned by democracy advocates in both political parties.",
      "Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on his election victory and in a concession speech later in the day at Howard University, her alma mater, she pledged to assist Trump with a peaceful transfer of power.",
      "\u201cA fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\u201d she said.",
      "Her concession hasn\u2019t stopped numerous left-leaning users on social platforms such as X and TikTok from calling for a recount or raising unsubstantiated suspicion about the outcome of her race with Trump. Some amassed tens of thousands of shares promoting baseless claims that Harris\u2019 vote totals showed something was amiss. While there is no longer a path to the presidency for Harris, the presidential vote totals are still incomplete as several states continue to count ballots.",
      "Meanwhile, for some right-leaning election skeptics, even their candidate's decisive win didn't prove that the election was aboveboard.",
      "\u201cThey rigged 2020. We weren\u2019t ready. They tried to rig 2024. We were ready,\u201d David Clements, a former public prosecutor and conservative public speaker, wrote in a social media post.",
      "It remains to be seen exactly how the next Trump administration might seek to reform U.S. elections. MyPillow founder and election denier Mike Lindell sent an email to supporters Wednesday saying he had discussed with Trump plans to discard machines and go \"back to paper ballots, hand-counted.\u201d",
      "Nearly every ballot cast in American elections already has a paper record, and election officials warn that hand-counting all ballots would be costlier, more prone to error and far more time-intensive than machine counting.",
      "Becker said even though the absence of fraud allegations in Trump's victory speech showed his hand, it was a positive development.",
      "\u201cIf we can get to the point now where President Trump and his supporters believe in the integrity of our elections ... I will take it,\u201d Becker said. \u201cWe wake up this morning with less likelihood that election officials around the country are going to be targeted \u2013 by name in many cases \u2013 for potential violence, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",

      "Interest rates are widely expected to be cut by the Bank of England on Thursday, in a move closely watched by businesses and consumers.",
      "Most analysts predict that the benchmark rate will fall from its current level of 5% to 4.75% when the decision is announced at 12:00 GMT.",
      "That would make borrowing money cheaper, but is likely to reduce the returns available to savers.",

      "Later in the day, the US central bank - the Federal Reserve - will also publish its latest interest rate decision.",
      "It will come just a day after Donald Trump won the presidential race.",
      "Bank of England expectation",
      "The Bank of England cut interest rates from 5.25% to 5% in August, which was the first drop in more than four years following a string of increases.",
      "Since then, official figures have revealed that the UK inflation rate - which charts the rising cost of living - dropped unexpectedly to 1.7% in September.",
      "That was the lowest rate for three-and-a-half years and below the 2% target set by the government. Interest rates are the main tool for the Bank to control the level of inflation.",
      "Subsequent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that wage growth slowed to its lowest pace for more than two years.",
      "That gave more impetus to the likelihood of a Bank rate cut.",
      "Bank Governor Andrew Bailey also told the Guardian last month that it could be a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d at cutting borrowing costs, depending on the rate of inflation.",
      "How it affects borrowers and savers",
      "The Bank's base interest rate heavily influences the rates High Street banks and other money lenders charge customers for loans, as well as credit cards.",
      "Lenders have mostly \"priced in\" the impact of a base rate cut when making decisions on their own interest rates.",
      "Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.4%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts. A five-year deal has an average rate of 5.11%.",
      "However, more than one million borrowers on tracker and variable deals could see an immediate fall in their monthly repayments if the Bank cuts rates.",
      "Savers would likely see a reduction in the returns offered by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year.",
      "Rachel Springall, of Moneyfacts, said: \"Savers are the ones who feel the force of cuts to interest rates. Those savers who use their interest to supplement their income will feel overlooked if rates plummet.\"",
      "Budget and US election impact",
      "Political events will feed into the Bank's decision on Thursday, specifically last week's Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Donald Trump's sweep to victory.",
      "The government's official, but independent, forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said, in the short term, measures announced in the Budget would push inflation and interest rates higher than they would otherwise have been.",
      "This has created more doubt about whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates again following its meeting in December.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts' forecasts suggest US inflation will be higher under the expectation that Trump will introduce higher tariffs on all imports next year.",
      "This would give the Federal Reserve less scope to ease interest rates, and could affect decisions made around the world, they said.",
      "What are my savings options?",

      "The first drop in rates for more than four years came in August, but borrowing costs remain high for many.",
      "What are interest rates and why do they change?",
      "An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.",
      "The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.",
      "This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts.",
      "The Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is the increase in the price of something over time.",
      "When inflation is high, the Bank may decide to raise rates to keep it at or near the 2% target.",

      "Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",
      "When will UK interest rates go down further?",
      "The current Bank rate is 5%, after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years.",

      "Inflation is now far below the peak of 11.1% in October 2022.",
      "The main inflation measure, CPI, rose by 1.7% in September which was down from 2.2% in August. This means prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023.",
      "Announcing the decision to hold rates in September - which had been widely predicted - Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said slowing inflation meant the Bank should be able to cut interest rates gradually over the upcoming months.",
      "But, he added, \"it's vital that inflation stays low, so we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much\".",
      "The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, and some of these remain higher than it would like.",
      "Some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - were still seeing more significant price rises in recent months.",
      "It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards.",
      "In October, Mr Bailey said that the Bank could be a \"bit more aggressive\" about cutting interest rates, meaning they could fall more quickly.",
      "However, he also said that the Bank was watching developments in the Middle East \"extremely closely\", in particular any movement in oil prices which could fuel inflation.",
      "Given the sharper than expected drop in the September inflation figure, many analysts now expect the Bank to cut rates.",
      "How much could interest rates fall?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as this depends whether inflation remains consistently below the Bank's target.",
      "In May, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended that UK interest rates should fall to 3.5% by the end of 2025.",
      "The organisation, which advises its members on how to improve their economies, acknowledged that the Bank had to balance the risk of not cutting too quickly before inflation is under control.",

      "Competition in recent weeks has brought some rates down.",

      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",

      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban will not apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus will be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",

    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "Shoplifting is at \"unacceptable\" levels and not being tackled properly, a Lords inquiry has found.",
      "The crime is seriously under-reported and the problem is so urgent police forces need to take \"immediate action\", according to the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee.",
      "It says retailers need to be able to report crimes more easily, more funding is needed for offender rehabilitation, and regulations should be introduced to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods online anonymously.",
      "The Home Office said it was making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence and deploying \"thousands\" of police officers dedicated to tackling shoplifting.",
      "The Lords committee held an inquiry into tackling shoplifting in which it heard evidence from police chiefs, retailers and industry experts in May and September.",
      "In a letter published today, it said there were more than 443,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March 2024 \u2013 the highest ever since records began 20 years ago.",
      "But they were \"a drop in the ocean\" when compared with likely real figures estimated at 17 million annually \u2013 which has \"devastating consequences for businesses and families\".",
      "Shop theft has evolved from \"individualised offending to relentless, large-scale, organised operations accompanied by unprecedented levels of violence\", it added.",
      "Tracey Robertson, co-owner of Paw Prints \u2013 a small chain of pet shops across Yorkshire \u2013 says shoplifting costs her business around \u00a38,000 a year.",
      "\"It\u2019s a financial impact on a family business. It\u2019s bad in the fact that it affects the staff that work for us because sometimes it\u2019s aggressive and violent,\" she said.",
      "The committee supported schemes like Project Pegasus - a partnership between retailers and police to tackle organised shoplifting gangs - but said there needs to be a strategy to deal with local prolific offenders too.",
      "\"The scale of the shop theft problem within England and Wales is totally unacceptable and action, like that under way in the Pegasus scheme, is vital and urgent,\" said Lord Foster of Bath, chair of the committee.",
      "The committee found there is a widespread perception that shop theft is not treated seriously by the police which \"risks undermining confidence in the police and wider criminal justice system\".",
      "It said shoplifting cost the retail sector nearly \u00a32bn last year \u2013 which resulted in price rises impacting individuals, families and communities.",
      "\"We acknowledge the pressures on police resources, but we believe that the urgency of the situation relating to shop theft requires immediate action within existing police staffing levels,\" the letter said.",
      "It has made a series of recommendations to the government which it says would \"help tackle the problem and keep the public and our economy safer\".",
      "These include:",
      "Phasing out the use of the outdated term \"shoplifting\" which serves to trivialise the severity of the offenceDeveloping improved reporting systems to enable retailers to report crime to the police quickly and easilyIncreasing funding to community-based reoffending and rehabilitation initiativesIntroducing regulations to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods on online marketplaces anonymouslyIntroducing regulations and best practice guidance for the use of facial recognition technology by private companies",

      "\"If adopted by the police, the industry and the government it will certainly do a huge amount to begin to turn the tide on the tsunami of shop theft that has impacted the retail sector across the UK.\"",
      "The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said it welcomed the report which further highlights the significant impact retail crime has on its victims.",
      "\"We are doing all we can to reduce thefts and pursue offenders, especially those prolific and habitual offenders, who cause misery within the community,\" said Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman, the NPCC\u2019s lead for acquisitive crime.",
      "The Home Office said it understands the \"devastating impact\" of shop theft has on communities.",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We are taking immediate action through our commitment to scrap the \u00a3200 shop theft threshold, and making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence.",
      "\"We will also put thousands more dedicated police officers on our streets, and establish a Retail Crime Forum for retailers to confidently implement tactics against shop theft.\""

    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "UK students will pay more for university in England next year, as undergraduate tuition fees rise to \u00a39,535 a year.",
      "It is an increase of \u00a3285 on the fees, which have been frozen at a maximum of \u00a39,250 since 2017.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told MPs in Parliament on Monday that maintenance loans would also go up to help students manage the cost of living.",
      "The National Union of Students called the tuition fees rise a \"sticking plaster\", but said higher maintenance loans \"will make a real difference to the poorest students\".",
      "For universities, the higher fees are a cash injection to assist with their most immediate financial challenges.",
      "However, the announcement only affects fees and loans in the 2025/26 academic year \u2013 and vice-chancellors will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",
      "Phillipson said the government would announce further \"major reform\" for long-term investment in universities in the coming months.",
      "She said the government was having to \"take the tough decisions needed to put universities on a firmer financial footing\".",

      "In the Commons on Monday, Conservative shadow education secretary Laura Trott called the tuition fee rise \u201ca hike in the effective tax graduates have to pay\u201d.",
      "Next year both tuition fees and maintenance loans will be linked to a measure of inflation called RPIX, which counts the cost of everything except mortgage interest costs.",
      "It is currently set at 3.1%.",
      "That will increase maintenance loan caps from \u00a310,227 to \u00a310,544 for students living away from their parents outside of London, and from \u00a313,348 to \u00a313,762 in London.",
      "Maintenance grants, which were non-repayable, were scrapped in 2016.",
      "In their analysis of the changes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the tuition fees increase would spare universities a further real-terms cut to their teaching resources.",
      "But they urged the government to say whether fees would continue to increase after next year, \"to provide some certainty to universities and prospective students alike\".",
      "They also said that, under current repayment terms, around a quarter of the extended loans would eventually be written off and paid by the taxpayer.",
      "Although students taking out the highest possible maintenance loans would be getting more money next year, the IFS said they would still be borrowing 9% less in real terms than they would have done in 2020/21.",
      "The changes announced on Monday will affect students starting university next year, as well as current students - although universities can have contracts that protect their students from fee hikes part-way through a course.",
      "Students Shay and Zay, both in their first year studying product design at Manchester Metropolitan University, said higher fees could put off prospective students.",
      "Zay said tuition fees were \"already quite a big factor playing on a lot of people's minds\" when deciding whether to go to university.",
      "Shay said university was \"already expensive as it is\", but added that he was more worried about his maintenance money being able to cover the cost of living.",

    "summary": "He was in a gang as a child but became Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra's favourite collaborator.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones lived for 50 years after attending his own memorial service.",
      "When the musician suffered a brain aneurysm in 1974, his chances of survival were said to be so slim, and his stature so high, that his famous friends started planning a tribute concert.",
      "Then aged 41, Jones had already made an indelible mark on American music as a performer, arranger, songwriter, producer, soundtrack composer and record executive.",
      "He started out in the jumping jazz clubs of the 1950s; mastered soul, swing and pop on recordings by Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra and Lesley Gore; and reached the top 10 in his own right.",
      "Some of the biggest entertainers in America agreed to perform at his memorial.",
      "When he pulled through, the show went ahead anyway.",
      "Jones went along, accompanied by his neurologist, who gave strict instructions not to get too excited.",
      "\"That was hard to do with Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan and Sidney Poitier singing your praises,\" he told Newsweek in 2008.",
      "Even more exciting things were yet to come.",
      "Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop.",
      "Few branches of American popular music were immune to his influence.",
      "Jones had always been a survivor.",
      "He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago. His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.",
      "Young Quincy wanted to be a gangster too. \"You want to be what you see, and that's all we ever saw,\" he said.",
      "He and his brother were \"street rats\" and, when he strayed into the wrong neighbourhood at the age of seven, a rival gang member \"nailed my hand to a fence\". Another injury came from an ice pick to the face.",
      "His father took the family to Washington state, where one night Quincy and some friends broke into a community centre, looking for food. Inside, there was a piano.",
      "\"I touched it and every cell in my body said, this is what you'll do [for] the rest of your life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2016.",
      "The encounter \"changed my life\", he said in conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for a 2018 Netflix documentary, adding that, \"I would have been dead or in prison a long time ago\" if he hadn't discovered music.",
      "Quincy immediately began experimenting with instruments at school, settling on the trumpet, and began playing in nightclubs.",
      "At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.",
      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",
      "Jones also worked with many other big names of the age, including Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong and Sammy Davis Jr, while his solo album Body Heat reached the US top 10.",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "Quincy Jones, giant of US music, has died aged 91",
      "Meanwhile, he was forging a career writing soundtracks for TV shows and films including In Cold Blood, The Italian Job and Roots.",
      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "Frustrated, Layla began speaking about her experience with other former clients and Alexa Morden, host of The 98%, a podcast which explores the reality of work for jobbing actors.",
      "The most important thing Layla wanted to draw attention to though, was the operation of Jamie\u2019s agency for child actors, Luna Kids Casting.",
      "Kids agency",
      "Luna Kids Casting held auditions in April, July and October 2023, with pop-up banners in the Wigan studio suggesting children signed by Jamie went on to work for Cbeebies, Sky, Disney and Fox.",
      "Sarah Wilson\u2019s 10-year-old daughter was successful during busy auditions and a photoshoot day was scheduled for those children asked to join the books.",
      "Parents were asked to pay \u00a3180 in cash to Jamie's Mum on the reception desk.",
      "While this was \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d, Sarah says she felt reassured by the amount of paperwork requested prior to signing her daughter up.",
      "But costs kept mounting. They included a \u00a366 charge for a child\u2019s details and images to be uploaded to the agency\u2019s website and a fee of \u00a3120 to sign them up to Spotlight, a platform where actors are submitted for jobs.",
      "Agreements also outline a monthly fee of \u00a314.40. These charges were described as non-refundable.",

      "Despite paying just under \u00a3500 to Luna Kids Casting, Sarah says only one audition opportunity was sent to them. She moved her daughter to another agency.",
      "\u201cIt wasted a year of opportunity [and] it raised her hopes, a little girl\u2019s dreams.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis outcome is hugely disappointing. Mr Fisher and his rogue agency have treated its clients appallingly, leading to the loss of significant amounts of money owed to them.\u201d",
      "Others have questioned the role of the platform Spotlight. In 2019, former employers warned Spotlight alleging that Jamie was submitting fake credits for his own clients, as well as \u201cconcocting\u201d productions that never existed.",
      "They claimed his \u201cconsistent fabrications\u201d could cause damage to the industry, but said they heard little back.",
      "In response, Spotlight told the BBC it was provided with verified references from casting professionals who had been positive about their business dealings with Jamie Fisher.",

      "He suggests that actors should look for established agencies, read any contracts carefully and speak to current clients if looking for representation.",
      "Alongside Equity, actors we spoke to said they were in the process of, or had, submitted reports to the EASI, the government-backed watchdog which polices UK employment agencies. It has the power to bar individuals from practicing.",
      "The BBC understands it is currently investigating complaints around Luna Kids Casting and the Bodhi Talent Agency.",
      "In the meantime, Thea and Jack have been left wondering if they will ever see any of the money they say they are owed.",

      "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not shorten or lengthen the life expectancy of those taking it to ease menopause symptoms, says the health assessment body NICE in updated guidance.",
      "Its conclusion comes after a detailed analysis of data on links between HRT and conditions such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers and dementia.",
      "The guidance includes a new discussion aid to help GPs give patients the most useful information they can about the drugs and what they do.",
      "And it says talking therapy could be offered alongside HRT, to help women cope with symptoms.",
      "HRT replaces the hormones oestrogen or progestogen, or both, when women's periods stop - normally between the ages of 45 and 55.",
      "It is administered using gels, creams, pessaries, tablets or sprays.",
      "In updated menopause guidelines, NICE (the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence) says healthcare professionals should take into account a woman's personal situation, and provide all the information needed to help her make the best choice on treatment.",
      "The guidance highlights that while there are some increased risks linked to taking HRT, it is unlikely to lengthen or shorten overall life expectancy.",
      "Easy-to-read illustrations of the likelihood of developing certain health conditions are featured. These are intended to help GPs have informed conversations with patients.",
      "Dr Marie Anne Ledingham, consultant clinical adviser to NICE, explained that an independent panel assessed available scientific evidence to come up with the information.",
      "She said the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and ovarian and endometrial cancer was no higher among women aged 45 and over taking combined HRT, compared to those who had never taken it.",
      "And HRT actually reduced the risk of fractures linked to the bone condition osteoporosis, which is more likely to develop after the menopause.",
      "But the risk of breast cancer for women did rise slightly, affecting:",

      "The risk of dementia was also slightly higher if women started taking HRT after the age of 65. In younger patients there was no elevated risk of developing dementia.",
      "\"The risks are very low in the population, and HRT can provide huge benefits at a very difficult point in many women's lives,\" Dr Ledingham said.",
      "The guidance is clear that HRT is the go-to treatment option for hot flushes and night sweats caused by the menopause.",
      "Talking therapy known as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) is to be offered to women over 40 alongside HRT or, if the patient's individual circumstances call for it, in place of it.",
      "That is a change from draft guidelines, published in late 2023, which caused controversy by suggesting that talking therapy could replace HRT as a treatment.",

    "summary": "The government says it wants to mitigate the \"harm\" social media is inflicting on children.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban will not apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus will be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",
      "\"These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.\""

    "title": "Bill to ban police cell mental health detentions",
    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The move is part of an overhaul of decades-old mental health legislation in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Police will no longer be able to hold people who are being detained for mental-health reasons in police cells, under government plans for England and Wales.",
      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"outdated\" system was in need of changes to bring it \"in line with the 21st Century\".",
      "'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on'",
      "'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauled",
      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

      "The NHS will review whether to change its advice on testing for prostate cancer in light of Sir Chris Hoy's \"powerful\" call for more younger men to be checked, the health secretary has said.",
      "Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris, 48, has advanced cancer that has spread to his bones and is terminal.",
      "In his first TV interview since announcing his condition, Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast how people with a strong family history should consider seeing their GP for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test to help spot the disease.",
      "PSA tests are not routinely offered to men under 50 without symptoms but who may be at risk. Doctors are instead told to use their judgement.",
      "Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast: \"To me it seems a no-brainer. Why would they not reduce the age? Bring the age down and allow more men to go in and get a blood test.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that Sir Chris makes a powerful argument. \"That's why I've asked the NHS to look at the case for lowering the age.\"",

      "I'm more grateful for each day, Sir Chris Hoy tells BBC",
      "NHS guidelines for England say anyone can request a PSA test if they are over the age of 50.",
      "And men of any age who have symptoms can also ask for one.",
      "Routine PSA testing or screening is not offered on the NHS, because experts say the test is not accurate enough on its own to rule in or out cancer reliably. Doctors are looking at whether adding in MRI scans to PSA tests might improve the situation.",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "The charity Prostate Cancer UK backs the call, saying doing more checks could potentially save thousands of lives each year.",
      "Spokeswoman Chiara De Biase said: \"One in eight men will get prostate cancer, but there's currently no screening programme for the disease.",
      "\"If your dad or brother has had prostate cancer, or you're black, you have the highest risk of getting the disease, and we strongly recommend you talk to your GP about testing from 45.",
      "\"Right now, you need to be aware of this and bring it up with a GP yourself. As prostate cancer often has no symptoms in its earlier stages this is leading to too many men getting a late, incurable diagnosis - like Sir Chris.\"",
      "Sir Chris spoke of the \"absolute shock and horror\" he felt at his initial diagnosis.",
      "The news that he had a terminal illness, in September 2023, came \"completely out the blue\".",
      "\"No symptoms, no warnings, nothing. All I had was a pain in my shoulder and a little bit of pain in my ribs.\"",
      "And he spoke of the \"nightmare\" of learning wife Sarra had multiple sclerosis, and having to break the news to their two young children.",
      "\"We just tried to be positive and tried to say 'Do you know what? This is what we're doing and you can help because when I'm not feeling well, you can come and give me cuddles, you can be supportive, you can be happy, you can be kind to each other'.\"",
      "He said he was grateful for the outpouring of support they had received and that he was focusing on the positives and the good he hopes can come from it.",
      "'It's been the toughest year'",
      "His news prompted a near eight-fold increase in NHS searches for prostate cancer symptoms over the following days.",
      "\"It's been the toughest year of our lives so far by some stretch,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Maybe people seeing this or hearing about my story - just by them asking their GP - will create enough of a surge of interest that people that make the decisions will go 'you know what, we need to address this'. And in the long term this will save potentially millions of lives.\"",
      "He added: \"I know what the end result will be. Nobody lives forever. Our time on this planet is finite. Don't waste your time worrying about stuff that isn't that important. Focus on the things that are.",
      "\"My perspective on life has changed massively. I am more thankful, I'm more grateful for each day. It's been a tough year and it's going to be tough ahead in the future too but for now, right here right now, we're doing pretty well.\"",
      "The NHS advises men to speak to a doctor if they think they are higher risk of prostate cancer. A man's risk of this cancer increases with age.",
      "Cancer Research UK says the evidence so far suggests that routinely screening people using PSA would not greatly help prevent deaths and might instead lead to men having unnecessary treatment that could cause undue stress and potential side effects.",
      "PSA is not diagnostic. A raised PSA level does not necessarily mean there is cancer. It can be elevated with other conditions too, such as inflammation.",
      "If you ask for a PSA test, your doctor may advise you to think carefully about the benefits and disadvantages.",
      "The full interview - Sir Chris Hoy: Finding Hope - will be shown on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday, 5 November and will then be available to watch on BBC iPlayer. You can also listen in full on BBC Sounds.",

      "The fertility rate - which measures how many children are born per woman during her child-bearing years - is the lowest on record at 1.44. Scotland's is even lower at 1.3.",
      "Britain is not unique - most countries are experiencing declining fertility and some are even going to great lengths to create a baby boom.",
      "So what's causing the fall-off in fertility? There's the high cost of bringing up children, the pressure to stay in work and the challenge of finding the right partner.",
      "But there's also evidence that more and more young adults don't plan on having any children at all.",

      "It means despite Kari's above-average salary, he has had less time to save for a property - something he thinks is essential before becoming a parent because of the \"relatively insecure\" nature of renting.",
      "He also cites the costs of childcare. According to a recent report by children's charity Coram, the average weekly price for a full-time childcare place for children under three in the UK is about \u00a3300, compared with nearly \u00a3430 in inner London.",

      "Ellie says she 's concerned about the additional financial pressure on single-parent households.",

      "Since then, official figures have revealed that the UK inflation rate - which charts the rising cost of living - dropped unexpectedly to 1.7% in September.",
      "That was the lowest rate for three-and-a-half years and below the 2% target set by the government. Interest rates are the main tool for the Bank to control the level of inflation.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The move is part of an overhaul of decades-old mental health legislation in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Police will no longer be able to hold people who are being detained for mental-health reasons in police cells, under government plans for England and Wales.",
      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"outdated\" system was in need of changes to bring it \"in line with the 21st Century\".",
      "'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on'",
      "'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauled",
      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",

      "But it also highlights the scale of the task when it comes to increasing the supply of renewable energy, and connecting it to the grid.",
      "Meeting the pledge, it finds, would require a significant boost to offshore wind capacity, alongside increased electrification of heat, transport and industry.",
      "Nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of new power lines would be required to connect new renewable energy to the grid, along with 4,800 km of undersea cables, it said.",
      "The report points out that this would be more than double over five years what has been built in total in the last 10, requiring many projects to begin construction in the next 6 months to two years.",
      "It added that this \"challenging\" timescale will require changes to the planning system to cut down the time new projects take to get approval.",
      "The construction of hundreds of miles of new pylons is also likely to run into political opposition, with a number of schemes facing fierce local opposition.",

      "The GMB union, which represents oil and gas workers and donates to Labour, said any government plans to boost wind and solar power should come with a \"cast iron commitment to delivering quality jobs here\".",
      "Impact on bills",
      "NESO's report estimated that the 2030 clean energy plan would require an average of \u00a340bn in investment a year, most of it from the private sector, requiring a significant boost from current levels.",
      "It did not model the impact of its blueprint on consumer bills \"given the heavy dependence on policy choices\".",
      "But the report predicts wholesale energy prices are likely to fall with decreased reliance on gas, which often spikes unpredictably.",
      "The exact timing of any drop in costs depends on how quickly clean energy infrastructure can be built and related policy decisions, the report said.",
      "It argued that consumer costs were unlikely to rise, as fixed prices for renewable projects would offset reduced natural gas needs.",
      "It also said the 2030 target would depend on a four to fivefold expansion of its demand flexibility service, under which households and firms are encouraged to save money by using less electricity at busy times.",
      "The authority will also begin consulting on plans to overhaul the system for connecting new renewable power stations to the grid, to prioritise projects that are ready to be built.",

      "And \"reforming the licence fee, replacing it, or coming up with a whole new mechanism\" of funding all remain on the table.",

      "In his speech, Dr Shah also said public service broadcasters (PSBs) like the BBC were a \"very British success story\", but that ministers must ensure they do not become a thing of the past.",
      "He said \"the fight is on\" for the future of public service broadcasting amid growing competition from streaming.",

      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said the concept of reparations for former colonial nations affected by slavery \"is not about the transfer of cash\".",
      "In his first comments since 56 Commonwealth leaders signed a statement saying the time had come for a conversation about reparations, Lammy told the BBC that was not \"the debate people are wanting to have\".",
      "The UK government previously ruled out paying reparations for slavery and Downing Street said its position included \"other forms of non-financial reparatory justice too\".",

      "Lammy said he believed developing nations would benefit as part of that through things such as the transfer of technical skills and science expertise from the UK.",
      "Lammy spoke to the BBC at the beginning of a trip in which he will visit Nigeria and South Africa - among the continent's biggest economies.",

      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",

      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",

    "title": "Badenoch's win and Labour's big Budget mean we now have sharper left-right divide",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 15:21:21 GMT",
    "summary": "With the government announcing big spending and tax, the differences between the two main parties feel sharper, writes Laura Kuenssberg.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like week zero,\u201d a government insider suggests. A new Conservative leader today. A whopper of a Budget on Wednesday.",
      "Add those two events together and it feels like this is the week that everything changed \u2013 the clock restarts.",
      "The tramlines are now set for the battles ahead, a member of the cabinet tells me. A Labour government that\u2019s now unabashed in the big choices it\u2019s made, the winners and losers they\u2019ve picked.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative boss, is unashamed in saying what the softer fringes of the Tory party has felt squeamish about until now.",
      "And maybe we\u2019ve entered a new era when the fabled centre ground of politics feels a bit emptier \u2013 and the differences between the two main parties are sharper.",
      "The consequences of the Budget are still emerging, and the real effect won\u2019t be clear for many months. There has been no huge unravelling, but ministers are still incredibly aware they\u2019ll still need to explain it.",
      "If your doorbell rings this afternoon and it\u2019s a grinning person with a red rosette and a leaflet, you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re up to.",
      "The party knows the decisions, particularly to whack billions on employers\u2019 national insurance, have caused some anxiety among some voters. This will also hit GP practices and charities, which have flagged fears about the cost of the change - and no government wants to go to war with them.",
      "No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election.",
      "The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers.",
      "But Labour is having to learn what it\u2019s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there\u2019s confidence the public is broadly onside.",
      "Insiders say No 10\u2019s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage.",
      "One government source says, \u201cpeople looked at the Budget and said, \u2018that makes sense\u2019. That is a platform we can build on.\u201d",
      "The decisions, and the government\u2019s true motivations \u2013 are out there now in black and white. The source says \u201cit\u2019s the first time \u2013 certainly in government, probably in the whole project \u2013 we have been able to show, rather than just tell.\u201d",
      "However, after all of Labour\u2019s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there\u2019s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday.",
      "Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon.",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t mind if you don't like her Budget",
      "A senior business leader told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation \u2013 that still needs work.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Labour\u2019s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects.",
      "But there\u2019s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be \u201craised in every negotiating room\u201d, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.",
      "But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for?",
      "And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by \u2013 economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list.",
      "Starmer\u2019s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives\u2019 mantle for being the party you can trust with public money.",
      "But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle.",
      "A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise.",
      "\u201cTraditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election \u2013 ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour in its veins,\u201d says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what\u2019s been described as a \u201cprogramme for government\u201d that will make it even more clear.",
      "New Conservative chapter",
      "The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.",
      "It\u2019s more straightforward perhaps if Labour\u2019s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue.",
      "Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It\u2019s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. \u201cIt\u2019s back to the future,\u201d one Tory source tells me.",
      "\u201cWe can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,\u201d opposing bigger government and bigger taxes.",
      "Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, \u201cthe government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour.",
      "\u201cIt is workerist, it\u2019s not very nice to farmers or rural areas \u2013 with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.\u201d",
      "Badenoch\u2019s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don\u2019t have an automatic right to get attention.",
      "One supporter was convinced that \u201cwhatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.\u201d But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader.",
      "It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government\u2019s tax rises in the Budget. But it\u2019s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services.",
      "It\u2019s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make.",
      "Labour\u2019s decisions mean, despite Badenoch\u2019s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on.",
      "A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has \u201cset up a public services Parliament \u2026 you can\u2019t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.\u201d",
      "As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July\u2019s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now.",
      "The party is described by sources as \u201cfractious\u201d, and  \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm.",
      "One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they\u2019d even been told by one former minister: \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.\u201d",
      "Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before.",
      "There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: \u201cShe has the potential to be Heineken \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.\u201d",
      "But her style has risks - \u201clike a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,\u201d and make a terrible mess.",

      "Chris Mason: Badenoch will need all her political savvy to transform Tory fortunes",
      "A Labour government that has expressed its priorities with big borrowing, big spending and big tax that believes the public is on board, after years when Budgets at home and in Whitehall have been under so much pressure.",
      "And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don\u2019t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too.",
      "But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now.",
      "For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash.",
      "Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all.",
      "A former cabinet minister suggests now we\u2019ll be much less like \u2018the stepping stone\u2019 between America and the rest of Europe. Politics is an ever-shifting kaleidoscope but Labour\u2019s enormous Budget has set new terms.",

      "Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch - who is the new Conservative leader - divides opinion even within her own party.",
      "Her robust views, \"anti-woke\" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots and they have chosen her over fellow right-winger Robert Jenrick.",
      "As the first black woman to lead a major UK political party she has made history, but she is no fan of identity politics and is not likely to make much of that as she sets to work on the formidable task of restoring her party's battered fortunes.",
      "The former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they \"talked right, but governed left\", and need to \"stop acting like Labour\" to win back power.",
      "It is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.",
      "Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.",
      "Badenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured.",
      "She returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere.",
      "After completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law.",
      "She then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank  Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.",
      "According to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming \"radicalised\" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.",
      "She later described student activists there as the \"spoiled, entitled, privileged metropolitan elite-in-training\".",
      "Badenoch and Jenrick wait for results of Tory leadership race",
      "Chris Mason: Challenges ahead for Kemi Badenoch",
      "Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012.",
      "When two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat.",
      "She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.",
      "Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.",
      "To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.",
      "What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.",
      "Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.",
      "Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.",
      "Rishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.",
      "Her time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues.",
      "As a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.",
      "In an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.",
      "\"I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here.",
      "\"I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,\" she added.",
      "She calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity.",
      "As the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",
      "Responding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been \"hijacked by ideologues\" while critics were \"gagged\", resulting in children being harmed.",
      "She has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.",
      "In 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to \"consider her position\" over the failure to deliver a manifesto pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.",
      "Badenoch is often labelled a \"culture warrior\" but she disputes the tag.",
      "Sometimes accused of wanting to start a fight in an empty room, she says she does not like to fight - but is prepared to fight to defend Conservative principles.",
      "That is simultaneously what endears her to Conservative MPs and what makes some of them anxious.",
      "During the early stages of the leadership election several Conservative MPs told the BBC they were inclined to support Badenoch but were put off by fractious interactions while she was in government.",
      "To her supporters, that\u2019s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.",
      "On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were \"equally valid\", citing as an example \"cultures where women are told that they should not work\".",
      "She also got attention in Birmingham for quipping that 5-10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. She has previously strongly denied bullying officials.",
      "But she backtracked after an interview in which she appeared to suggest the current level of maternity pay was \"excessive\". She claimed her words had been \"misrepresented\", saying she had been talking about excessive business regulation and maternity pay was \"a good thing\".",
      "In 2018, Badenoch admitted that, a decade earlier, she had hacked into the website of then-Commons leader and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as a prank. Harman accepted her apology.",
      "Among public spats, in February, she accused the Post Office chair she had sacked of seeking \"revenge\" by \"making up\" claims he been told to delay compensation payments for sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.",

      "Appearing before a Commons committee, she told chair Caroline Nokes \"loads of people\" wanted to use equalities law as \"a tool for different personal agendas and interests\".",
      "During her leadership campaign, Badenoch has spoken of Conservatism being \"in crisis\" - under attack from a new \"progressive ideology\" involving \"identity politics\" (politics based on a particular identity such as race, religion or gender), constant state intervention, and \"the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals\" or elected politicians.",
      "Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.",
      "She rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's \"system is broken\" and requires a reset.",
      "The Conservative Party, she adds, needs to return to its core values and come up with new policies that recognise this reality."

    "title": "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 19:47:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "We've seen a range of claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "The largest estimate - 70,000 - relates to the total number that could ever be affected. But the number of farms likely to be impacted each year is likely to be around 500.",
      "Will 70,000 farms be affected?",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change, claiming it would impact around 70,000 farms.",
      "That figure comes from the Country Land and Business Association. Its president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "That's not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it's an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at University of Reading, Whiteknights pointed to various sources including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "An alternative way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "Sally Shortall, professor of rural economy at Newcastle University, points out they will not be evenly distributed across the country because of differing land values. \"Farms in England are likely to be the hardest hit,\" she said.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Is it 500 farms a year?",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "The Treasury estimates that 500 estates including agricultural land will be affected by the agricultural property relief reform per year.",
      "Dan Neidle, an independent tax expert, says the number of actual farms affected is likely to be below 500 per year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value).",
      "However, as Mr Neidle points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is an \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it's being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "Now the Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are insufficient to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (which is the percentage return that they are making from things like land and machinery) is only about 0.5%, which is very low.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

    "summary": "It is also set to be the world's first breach of 1.5C of warming across an entire calendar year.",
    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's election will hit immediate efforts to tackle climate change, experts say - but the longer-term effect is less certain.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House will have a hugely negative effect on climate change action in the short-term but the longer term impact is less certain, experts say.",
      "With world leaders meeting next week for the latest UN climate talks, COP29, the Trump victory will be seen as a huge roadblock to progress in both cutting emissions and raising cash for developing countries.",
      "The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a \"scam\".",
      "But with renewable energy gaining a strong foothold in the US and popular support for wind and solar, Trump's efforts to ramp up oil and gas instead may be less effective.",
      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",
      "This was ratified by the US Senate, almost unanimously, in 1992. Legal experts are unclear on the process of leaving the treaty, but any effort by the US to leave would be seen as a body blow to the principle of multi-lateral action to tackle the world's greatest threat.",
      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",
      "\"You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy,\" Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News.",
      "\"You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers.\"",
      "There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.",
      "But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for  coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.",
      "For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.",
      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",
      "According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.",
      "With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.",
      "Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration.",
      "\"The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action,\" said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:59:31 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says it wants to mitigate the \"harm\" social media is inflicting on children.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban will not apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus will be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",
      "\"These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.\""

      "The regulator says a merger between Vodafone and Three could go ahead - if both companies make price promises for consumers and commit to boosting the UK's 5G rollout.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously said that creating what would be the country's biggest mobile network could drive up prices and harm competition.",
      "But it has now provisionally concluded those concerns could be addressed - and the merger could proceed - if the firms agree to its proposed remedies.",
      "A Vodafone spokesperson said both companies would need to study the CMA's proposal more closely but believed on first impressions it \"provides a path to final clearance\".",
      "They insisted, as they have throughout, that the deal was in everyone's interests.",
      "\"It will bring significant benefits to businesses and consumers throughout the UK, and it will bring advanced 5G to every school and hospital across the country,\" they said.",
      "The CMA's findings are the latest step in its probe into the merger, which began in January.",
      "Vodafone and Three announced their plans to merge their UK-based operations in June last year.",
      "Their combined network would have around 27 million customers.",
      "\"We believe this deal has the potential to be pro-competitive for the UK mobile sector if our concerns are addressed,\" said Stuart McIntosh, who is leading the CMA panel investigating the merger.",
      "\"We anticipate in the longer term that the significant commitment to upgrade the merged companies network over the next 10 years or so will ultimately create a competitive environment that will maintain the competition we've seen in mobile in recent years,\" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four.",
      "But he also made clear that short term commitments not to increase the price of certain existing mobile tariffs and data plans for at least three years were also key to making sure consumers did not lose out.",
      "The regulator also said upholding pre-agreed deals or prices with Mobile Virtual Network Operators such as Sky Mobile, Lyca and Lebara could protect consumers and and wholesale customers alike.",
      "Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told the BBC it marked \"another key step towards approval\" and showed all concerned were trying to find a way to make the deal happen.",
      "The two largest players in the market are currently EE and 02 - Mr Pescatore said a merged Vodafone and Three would be in a better place to take them on.",
      "\"To date, both parties are demonstrating that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and users which paves the way for a far stronger three-player market than the current imbalance,\" he said.",
      "The CMA is seeking responses to its proposed remedies by 12 November, with a deadline of 7 December for a final decision on the merger."

      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",

      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",

      "He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.",
      "In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.",
      "Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.",
      "Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?",
      "The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.",
      "Perhaps there\u2019s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.",

      "Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.",

      "What happens to the DNA?",
      "Companies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.",

      "\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.",

      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",

      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",

    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

    "story": [
      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "Publicly, she conceded the race late on Wednesday afternoon, telling supporters \"do not despair\".",
      "But soul-searching over where she went wrong and what else she could have done will likely take longer as Democrats begin finger-pointing and raising questions about the future of the party.",

      "Biden's baggage",
      "After Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate performance, Harris was anointed to the top of the ticket, bypassing the scrutiny of a primary without a single vote being cast.",
      "She began her 100-day campaign promising a \"new generation of leadership\", rallying women around abortion rights and vowing to win back working-class voters by focusing on economic issues including rising costs and housing affordability.",
      "With just three months until election day, she generated a wave of initial momentum, which included a flurry of memes on social media, a star-studded endorsement list that included Taylor Swift and a record-setting donation windfall.

But Jamal Simmons, the vice-president's former communication director, called it a \"trap\", arguing any distance would have only handed Republicans another attack line for being disloyal.",
      "\"You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,\" he said.",
      "Harris tried to walk the fine line of addressing the administration's record without casting shade on her boss, showing a reluctance to break with any of Biden's policies while also not outwardly promoting them on the campaign trail.",

      "The same survey found that 4 in 10 voters said immigrants living in the US illegally should be deported to their country of origin, up from around 3 in 10 who said the same in 2020.",
      "And though Harris tried to spend the home stretch of her campaign underlining that her administration would not be a continuation of Biden's, she failed to clearly outline her own policies, often skirting around issues instead of addressing perceived failures head on.",
      "Struggle to build on Biden's network of support",
      "The Harris campaign had hoped to reassemble the voting base that powered Biden's 2020 victory, winning over the core Democratic constituencies of black, Latino and young voters as well as making further gains with college-educated suburban voters.",
      "But she underperformed with these key voting blocs. She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends.",
      "Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton and the 2020 primary to Biden, said in a statement it was \"no great surprise\" that working class voters abandoned the party.",
      "\"First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" he said. \"And they're right.\"",
      "While women largely threw their support behind Harris over Trump, the vice-president's lead did not exceed the margins that her campaign had hoped her historic candidacy would turn out. And she was unable to deliver on her ambitions of winning over suburban Republican women, losing 53% of white women.",
      "In the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Democrats had hoped her focus on the fight for reproductive rights would deliver a decisive victory.",

    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban will not apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus will be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "At least 40 people were killed in Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "An Israeli official said the strikes, in the governorates of Baalbek and Bekaa, targeted operatives of the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.",
      "Lebanon's culture minister said one of the strikes also seriously damaged an Ottoman-era building in the vicinity of the Roman ruins in the city of Baalbek, which is a Unesco World Heritage site.",
      "Israeli strikes also hit southern Beirut on Wednesday, after the IDF issued evacuation warnings. The military said it struck Hezbollah command centres, weapons stores and other infrastructure.",
      "A later IDF warning covered four neighbourhoods in southern Beirut including an area near Lebanon's international airport, which has continued to operate despite Israel's air strikes on the capital city.",
      "Soon after, pictures showed a large fireball and thick black smoke rising into the night sky above Beirut.",
      "Meanwhile, a rocket fired by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon killed an Israeli man near a kibbutz in northern Israel, paramedics said.",
      "Lebanon's Civil Defence agency has also said the bodies of 30 people were recovered from a four-storey apartment building hit by an Israeli strike on Tuesday evening that destroyed one side of the building and sparked a fire.",
      "The building, in Barja, a predominantly Sunni Muslim coastal town south of Beirut, was reportedly housing displaced people.",
      "The Israeli military said it had struck \"terror infrastructure\u201d belonging to Hezbollah.",
      "A man who lived on one of the upper floors of the apartment building that was hit said his son and wife were injured by falling masonry.",
      "\"These rocks that you see here weigh 100kg, they fell on a 13kg kid,\" Moussa Zahran told Reuters news agency as he surveyed the damage.",
      "\u201cI removed [the rocks] and... handed my son to the civil defence through the window. I carried my wife and came downstairs and got out behind the building... I thank God, glory be to Him, for this miracle.\u201d",
      "An Irish Times correspondent cited a member of the civil defence at the scene as saying that those killed whose bodies were found complete included seven women and three children - a seven-month-old baby and two girls aged seven and 12.",
      "Neighbours also said the building was housing displaced people who had fled from other areas, she added.",
      "There was no evacuation warning ahead of the strike, according to Reuters.",
      "The Lebanese health ministry gave a preliminary death toll of 20 from the strike on Barja late on Tuesday but did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the ministry said 40 people had been killed and 53 others injured in a series of Israeli strikes in Bekaa and Baalbek governorates, which make up most of the eastern Bekaa Valley. They included 16 people killed in the village of Nasriyah and 11 in Baalbek city, it added.",
      "Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada also told the director-general of Unesco that one of the strikes had \"caused serious damage to the ancient Manshiya building\" in Baalbek city, which he said dated back to the Ottoman period and was located in the vicinity of the ruins of several Roman temples.",
      "\"The destruction of this exceptional monument next to a Unesco World Heritage site is an irremediable loss for Lebanon and for world heritage,\" he warned.",
      "An AFP news agency correspondent also reported that the famous 19th Century Palmyra Hotel near the Roman ruins was damaged by nearby strikes, which the health ministry said killed two people.",
      "An Israeli military official said its aircraft had carried out strikes based on precise intelligence indicating the presence of Hezbollah operatives in the Baalbek area.",
      "Chaos and destruction as Israel strikes deep in Lebanon\u2019s valley",
      "'We are not military - why are we being hit?'",
      "The military also said it had killed the commander of Hezbollah\u2019s forces in the southern border region of Khiam, and that a number of other Hezbollah fighters had been killed by air strikes and by troops operating inside southern Lebanon over the past day.",
      "Meanwhile, Hezbollah\u2019s new secretary general, Naim Qassem, said in a speech that the group had \u201ctens of thousands of trained resistance combatants\u201d ready to fight and that nowhere in Israel was \u201cbeyond the reach of our drones and missiles\u201d.",
      "\"I will tell you very clearly, our conviction is that only one thing can stop this war of aggression, and that is the battlefield,\" he declared, adding that he did not believe \"political action\" would end the conflict.",
      "The Israeli military said Hezbollah fired about 170 rockets into northern and central Israel on Wednesday.",
      "In the evening, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said a man was killed by a rocket near the kibbutz of Kfar Masaryk, which is south of the coastal town of Acre.",
      "Paramedics said the man was found in a field with severe shrapnel wounds and that he was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "Later, Israeli media identified him as Sivan Sade, an 18-year-old resident of Kfar Masaryk who had been working in the field.",
      "Also on Wednesday, Israeli media said one rocket hit a car park near Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, but the Israel Airport Authority said its operations were not affected. Hezbollah said it targeted the Tzrifin military base near the airport.",
      "A large section of a rocket also hit a parked car in the town of Raanana, just north of Tel Aviv.",
      "Since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah six weeks ago, at least 2,400 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million displaced across Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.",
      "Israeli air strikes have eliminated most of the group\u2019s leadership, including Qassem\u2019s predecessor Hassan Nasrallah, and caused widespread destruction in parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence.",
      "Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza.",
      "It says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.",
      "Israeli authorities say more than 70 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights over the past year."

      "Australian scientists have solved a mystery which has gripped Sydney: what were the sticky dark blobs which washed up on some of the city's famed beaches last month?",
      "Initially believed to be tar balls, they were in fact a \"disgusting\" combination of human faeces, cooking oil, chemicals and illicit drugs, researchers say.",
      "Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of the black deposits started appearing from 16 October.",
      "Testing by chemists has determined the balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill, though their exact origin remains unknown.",
      "Last month authorities in New South Wales (NSW) said they suspected the objects were a mixture of fatty acids, fuel oil and chemicals found in cleaning and cosmetic products.",
      "But further testing found the material is unlikely to have originated solely from an oil spill or waste from a ship, as some had thought.",
      "Each ball was slightly different but had a firm surface - hardened partially by accumulating sand and minerals like calcium - and a soft core.",
      "Inside was everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs.",
      "\"They smell absolutely disgusting, they smell worse than anything you've ever smelt,\" lead investigator Associate Professor Jon Beves, from the University of NSW, told 9News.",
      "Professor William Alexander Donald said they resembled fat, oil, and grease blobs - often called fatbergs - which are commonly formed in sewerage systems.",
      "Detecting this along with recreational drugs and and industrial chemicals had \"pointed us to sewage and other sources of urban effluent\", he explained.",
      "The researchers said they had received unconfirmed reports of smaller but otherwise similar balls washing up over the past two years.",

      "Gunn - who is known as B-girl Raygun - failed to get on the scoreboard in all three of her competition rounds in August, with a routine that included unorthodox moves, such as the sprinkler and a kangaroo hop.",
      "The 37-year-old university lecturer's moves catapulted her to global attention and ridicule, spawned conspiracy theories about her qualification, and reignited criticism of breaking's inclusion in the Olympics.",
      "Gunn had initially planned to keep competing but said the saga had been so \"upsetting\" that she changed her mind.",

      "Gunn received a torrent of violent messages after the Olympics, and was the subject of an anonymous petition demanding she apologise. It falsely accused her and her husband of manipulating her selection at the expense of other Australian talent.",
      "She was vigorously defended by Olympic officials, but her performance split opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the sport.",
      "How Raygun made it to the Olympics and divided breaking world",
      "It also revived questions over whether breaking - which debuted in Paris but is not on the programme for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles - should have ever been included in the Olympics, due to the creative nature of the genre, which doesn't necessarily suit organised competition.",
      "Gunn has previously said the backlash took the joy out of the sport for her, which she again alluded to on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has won the presidency of the United States, gaining a historic second term.",
      "Votes are still being counted, but a picture is emerging of what tipped the balance in Trump\u2019s favour: relatively small shifts in support in many different places.",
      "The map below shows in red the states where Trump won. Kamala Harris\u2019s victories are shown in blue.",
      "For the data in the map, click here",
      "Trump gathered the 270 electoral college votes needed to win after capturing three battleground states from the Democrats: Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, shown in red stripes.",
      "His margin of victory was slim in all three, but in Wisconsin he won by less than one percentage point - just over 28,000 votes at latest count.",
      "It is difficult to identify a single group or area in the state that moved the needle towards Trump.",
      "Neither party increased its share of the vote by more than 5% in any county across the state, compared with 2020. If you look at the map below the change is almost imperceptible.",
      "Harris did well in her traditional urban strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison. Voters did come out for her in large numbers, yet it was Trump\u2019s small but widespread gains in counties across the state that did the trick.",
      "In 2020, Biden\u2019s wins in Georgia and Pennsylvania were key to clinching the presidency.",
      "This election, Trump took both states. The precise reason is unclear as votes are still being counted, but what is emerging is a similar pattern of slight but widespread shifts towards Trump.",
      "Trump gains with Hispanic Nevadans",
      "In the western battleground of Nevada, Trump is leading. In the vote tally so far, there has been little change among the largest groups of voters.",
      "Black voters chose Harris in similar numbers as they did Biden, while white voters maintained their support for Trump.",
      "Yet the exit poll suggested Trump saw a substantial increase in support among Hispanic and Asian voters, with Harris losing ground compared with Biden four years ago.",
      "Trump raised his share among Hispanic voters by 13 points compared with 2020, which meant he and Harris ended up in a tie, both securing 48% of that vote.",
      "He also enjoyed a very substantial swing among Nevada\u2019s Asian voters, from 35% in 2020 to 57% in 2024.",
      "While the Asian community accounts for just 4% of voters surveyed, we\u2019ve seen how similarly small shifts made the difference elsewhere.",
      "Margins of victory",
      "A picture seems to be forming once again of a divide between rural and urban voters, as shown in the county level map below, although counting continues in many states particularly in the west.",
      "Harris led by tens of thousands of votes in major cities across the country.",
      "But Trump dominated the rural counties that lie between them. His wins may not appear to be as sizeable, but they are pervasive. And those margins add up.",
      "People voted for change",
      "While the picture in the states that flipped will become clearer in the coming days, we can see some emerging trends on how different groups of people voted across the nation from US exit polls.",
      "These cut across demographic groups and regions.",
      "On immigration and the economy, Trump was seen as the overwhelming favourite among voters for whom either was the most important issue.",
      "For voters who felt strongly about abortion or the state of democracy, more than three in four voted for Harris.",
      "This suggests a stark difference in priorities across the two groups of voters.",
      "Both campaigns emphasised these diverging issues in recent weeks, and it\u2019s clear the messaging cut through.",
      "The personalities of the candidates themselves may also have played a role in how ballots were cast.",
      "For those looking for a presidential candidate who would \u201cbring needed change\u201d to the country, a large majority voted for Trump. And two-thirds of those who most valued leadership skills did the same.",
      "A large majority of Harris voters chose her because they felt she had good judgement and \u201ccared about people like me\u201d.",
      "But the desire for change can be a powerful force when it comes to the way voters choose to cast their ballot."

      "He faces charges for allegedly inciting the violent attack on the US Capitol on the 6 January 2021. And he will also make history as the first sitting president to have been convicted of a felony, after being found guilty of falsifying business records.",
      "It\u2019s not hard to see why he is a deeply polarising figure.",
      "Throughout the campaign, Trump used incendiary rhetoric \u2013 making crass jokes and threatening vengeance against his political enemies.",
      "His message on the economy touched a chord",
      "Few people have a middle ground when it comes to Trump. Most of the voters I spoke to during the course of this campaign said they wished he would \u201cshut his potty mouth\u201d \u2013 but they were able to look past it.",
      "Instead, they focused on the question he asked at every rally. \u201cAre you better off now than you were two years ago?\u201d",
      "So many people who voted for Donald Trump told me again and again that they felt the economy was much better when he was in office and they were sick of trying to make ends meet. Although much of the cause of inflation was due to outside forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they blamed the outgoing administration.",
      "Voters were also deeply concerned about illegal immigration which had reached record levels under Biden. They usually didn\u2019t express racist views or believe that migrants were eating people\u2019s pets, as Trump and his supporters had claimed. They just wanted much stronger border enforcement.",

      "When he first came into power in 2016, he was a political outsider, and, at least for a while, he surrounded himself with veteran political advisers and staff who showed him the ropes and constrained his actions. Now he doesn\u2019t seem that interested in playing by the rules of the game.",
      "Many of these same advisers and staff have spoken out \u2013 calling him a \u201cliar\u201d, a \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d. They have cautioned that if he surrounds himself with loyalists, which he is expected to do, that there will be no one to restrain him from his more extreme ideas.",
      "When he left office, he faced a litany of criminal charges related to his role in the Capitol riots, how he handled documents pertaining to national security, and hush money payments to a porn star.",
      "But since the Supreme Court ruled that the president has total immunity from prosecution for official acts in office, it will be an uphill battle for any prosecutor to charge him during the next administration.",
      "And as president, he could instruct his justice department to drop the federal charges against him relating to the 6 January riots so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a jail sentence. At the same time, he could pardon hundreds of people sentenced to prison for their part in the Capitol Riots.",
      "In the end, voters were presented with two versions of America.",
      "Donald Trump told them that their country was a failing nation that only he could Make Great Again.",
      "Meanwhile, Harris cautioned that if Trump was elected, American democracy itself would face an existential threat. That remains to be seen. But what Trump said himself during the campaign has not exactly assuaged people\u2019s fears.",
      "He has heaped praise on authoritarian leaders like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whom he said were \u201cat the top of their game, whether you like it or not\u201d.",
      "He has talked about trying to silence critics in the press. Just days before the election, he also made comments that implied he wouldn\u2019t mind if members of the media were killed.",
      "And he has continued to amplify conspiracy theories and unfounded claims of election fraud \u2013 even though the election ultimately led to his victory.",

      "The rest of the world will now discover what \u201cAmerica First\u201d really means. From the global economic consequences of 20% tariffs that he has proposed on US imports to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East that he has vowed to end \u2013 regardless of which side wins.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House will have a hugely negative effect on climate change action in the short-term but the longer term impact is less certain, experts say.",
      "With world leaders meeting next week for the latest UN climate talks, COP29, the Trump victory will be seen as a huge roadblock to progress in both cutting emissions and raising cash for developing countries.",
      "The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a \"scam\".",
      "But with renewable energy gaining a strong foothold in the US and popular support for wind and solar, Trump's efforts to ramp up oil and gas instead may be less effective.",
      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",
      "This was ratified by the US Senate, almost unanimously, in 1992. Legal experts are unclear on the process of leaving the treaty, but any effort by the US to leave would be seen as a body blow to the principle of multi-lateral action to tackle the world's greatest threat.",
      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",
      "\"You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy,\" Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News.",
      "\"You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers.\"",
      "There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.",
      "But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for  coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.",
      "For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.",
      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",
      "According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.",
      "With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.",
      "Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration.",
      "\"The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action,\" said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief.",

      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",

      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",

      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:06:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Deputy PM admits former Soviet state was until recently a 'highly corrupt country' - but insists things are changing fast.",
    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

    "summary": "The PM's decision to replace his defence minister follows sharp disagreements over Israel's war strategy.",
    "story": [
      "We\u2019ve known for months that there is no love lost between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his now former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant.",
      "But this year, there have been reports of stand-up rows and shouting matches between the two men over Israel\u2019s war strategy.",
      "Gallant has vastly more military experience than Netanyahu.",
      "He began his career as a navy commando in 1977 and rose to be a major general in Israel\u2019s Southern Command, overseeing two wars in Gaza between 2005 and 2010.",
      "The suspicion is that Gallant\u2019s military superiority and respect from within the armed forces grated with his boss.",
      "In Israel\u2019s hard-line government, the most right-wing in the country\u2019s history, Gallant was less hawkish than some of his fellow ministers. But he was no dove.",
      "After Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, the country\u2019s biggest ever military humiliation, Gallant was initially fully behind the war in Gaza.",
      "Along with Netanyahu, he faces possible war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court. Both men rejected the allegations made by the ICC's prosecutor when he sought warrants for them in May.",
      "But in recent months as defence minister, Gallant argued that Israel's government should prioritise a hostage release deal with Hamas and end the war in Gaza.",
      "Protests erupt in Israel after Netanyahu fires defence minister",
      "Netanyahu aide leaks may have harmed hostage talks, court says",
      "Stories of the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel",
      "Netanyahu hasn\u2019t listened, insisting that continued military pressure on Hamas was the best way to free the remaining Israelis being held.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, Gallant had raised concerns about the lack of a post-war strategy. Again, it fell on deaf ears.",
      "He has pushed for a comprehensive investigation into the military, political, and intelligence failings that led to the 7 October attack.",
      "The prime minister has been resistant, arguing now is not the time.",
      "Gallant was also unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students to be exempt from serving in the military.",
      "At a time of multiple wars, he said, the country couldn\u2019t afford such luxuries.",
      "Netanyahu, wary of the collapse of his coalition government which has been dependent on support from the ultra-Orthodox parties, paid no heed.",
      "The new Defence Minister, Israel Katz, who up until yesterday was the foreign minister, is more hawkish and much more in step with his boss\u2019s thinking.",
      "Following his appointment, he vowed to \u201cachieve the goals of the war\u201d, including \u201cthe return of all hostages as the most important moral mission, the destruction of Hamas in Gaza, [and] the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d.",
      "But compared to Gallant, Katz has virtually no military experience.",
      "That will raise concerns here and abroad at a time when Israel is fighting two wars, in Gaza and in Lebanon, which risk further engulfing the wider Middle East.",
      "The cabinet has now lost the last remaining minister who was willing and able to confront Netanyahu, another likely reason Gallant was shown the door.",
      "There have been rumours for months that he was on the verge of being sacked.",
      "The timing of his dismissal on the day of the United States election cannot be ignored.",
      "The former defence minister has a much better relationship with President Joe Biden\u2019s White House than Netanyahu, whose rapport is frosty at best.",
      "His sacking can be seen as one more jab in the eye to the now outgoing US administration.",
      "It will come as no surprise if the Israeli prime minister is much more willing to listen to advice on war strategy handed out by Donald Trump\u2019s team.",
      "Of course, in the merry-go-round world of Israeli politics, no-one will be shocked if this is not the last we hear from Gallant.",
      "He has been sacked as defence minister once before, back in March 2023.",
      "On that occasion, along with many high-ranking military and former military officials, he was unhappy with Netanyahu\u2019s controversial plans to overhaul the judicial system.",
      "His dismissal led to tens of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets calling for him to be reinstated.",
      "After just a few days, Netanyahu was forced to back down and return Gallant to his position.",
      "On Tuesday night, as news broke that he had been sacked again, there were again protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but not on the same scale.",
      "Gallant belongs to the same political party as Netanyahu, Likud, and could one day challenge his leadership in any future elections.",
      "But the fact he has been given his marching orders now suggests the prime minister is feeling strong.",
      "As has been the case for the past year, it is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, its most Machiavellian and successful political operator, who is calling the shots."

      "Meanwhile, the political situation has been further complicated after calls by N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o for the prime minister to declare a national state of emergency, which would centralise management of the crisis in Madrid, wresting powers from Valencia\u2019s regional government.",
      "The leader of the far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, has also backed such a measure, which has been ruled out by the government.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 13:57:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The mystery song is called \"Subways of Your Mind,\" and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
    "story": [
      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "Charlotte, N.C. \u2014 NASCAR issued $600,000 in fines and suspended nine team members from three different teams on Tuesday for alleged race manipulation at Martinsville Speedway.",
      "The penalties came down after a contentious final battle Sunday at the Virginia track in which Christopher Bell initially qualified for the championship final four but his move to hit the wall and use it for momentum violated a banned safety rule and was disallowed.",
      "That gave the final spot in this week's winner-take-all finale at Phoenix Raceway to William Byron.",
      "The race itself was won by Ryan Blanely.",
      "But, NASCAR was clear in disqualifying Bell that it would take a hard look at the actions other drivers played in the sequence of events as Bell and Byron battled for the final spot in the championship flat.",
      "In the case of Bell, NASCAR determined fellow Toyota driver Bubba Wallace faked a flat tire in order to give Bell the leeway to move out of the way and hit the wall.",
      "In the case of Byron, NASCAR ruled that Ross Chastain and Austin Dillon both ran interference to help fellow Chevrolet driver Byron not lose any position on the track that would cost him a spot in the championship.",
      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",
      "Trackhouse Racing, which fields Chastain's Chevy, said it would appeal, as did 23XI for the Wallace's Toyota.",
      "\"We feel strongly that we did not commit any violations during Sunday's race,\" 23XI said in a statement.\"",
      "The team is currently embroiled in a lawsuit against NASCAR over the charter system and has Tyler Reddick racing Sunday for the Cup Series title.",
      "The penalties that were issued",
      "A $100,000 fine for Chastain, a $100,000 fine for Trackhouse, and one-race suspensions for team executive Tony Lunders, crew chief Philip Surgen and spotter Brandon McReynolds. Chastain is the defending race winner at Phoenix. The team also lost 50 points.",
      "Dillon was fined $100,000, as was Richard Childress Racing. One-race suspensions were given to team executive Keith Rodden, crew chief Justin Alexander and spotter Brandon Benesch. The team also lost 50 points. Richard Childress Racing also said it would appeal.",
      "Wallace was fined $100,000, as was 23XI. The one-race suspensions went to team executive Dave Rogers, crew chief Robert Barker and spotter Freddie Kraft. The team also lost 50 points.",
      "Sawyer had said Sunday that NASCAR would review the Martinsville finish to see if there was indeed any race manipulation with rival drivers helping others that are aligned with the same manufacturer.",
      "But he said he hoped the penalties were harsh enough to curb the manufacturer alliances and race manipulation.",
      "\"We took and looked at the most recent penalty that we had written for an infraction very similar... we wanted to ramp this one up,\" Sawyer said, \"and we did. We did that in a way that included team leadership and this is something that we felt like we wanted to get our point across that it is a responsibility of all of us.... to uphold the integrity of the sport.\"",

      "Online bidding has started and will continue through Dec. 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday.",
      "The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.",
      "That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018.",
      "\"It's become an infamous thing for us,\" said Janie Heitz, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum. \"We will forever be known as a place where the ruby slippers were stolen, which comes with a lot of bad but can also come with some good because it put us on the map.\"",

    "summary": "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music legend who collaborated with everyone from Michael Jackson to Frank Sinatra, has died at 91, his family announced.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\"My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: Take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\" Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "Jones, the epitome of versatility",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles' soulful \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \"We are the World\" alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson - \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\" - and Donna Summer - \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) - and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \"Sanford and Son.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 10:11:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The former child actor who grew up to play Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child in \"Succession,\" is now playing a rudderless man-child in Jesse Eisenberg's poignant comedy, \"A Real Pain.\"",
    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.' She could find exactly what the right thing to make fun of you was that would get to you, but be really funny and make the room laugh. That was her.\"",
      "Sixteen years later, the loss of his sister is still devastating. \"I only knew who I was because of who my siblings are,\" Kieran said. \"So, to lose one was losing a big piece of myself. Losing one of my favorite people in the world, it doesn't get easier. But you get used to it.\"",
      "Culkin's newest project is also about family. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" he and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and the concentration camp she survived.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child \u2026 a contrast to Eisenberg's straitlaced family man.",
      "Asked why he connected with the role, Culkin replied, \"I don't really know what it was with me, but I went, I instantly knew who this guy was. I understood the dynamic, and I really wanted to play.\"",
      "Describing the character, Culkin has said, \"I'm one quick little misstep away from being that person.\"",
      "\"That's good! I said that? Good!\" he laughed. \"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path. There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Indeed, Culkin is not \"that guy.\" He's been married to his wife Jazz for 11 years. The couple has two children.",
      "Asked what he likes about being a dad, Culkin said, \"Oh, man, everything. Everything except dinnertime. Dinnertime's a terror. I've seen some kids sit and eat dinner, it's great. My kids sit and eat breakfast, they'll eat lunch, but dinner is just throwing things around the house, and it's very stressful.\"",
      "Kieran Culkin may be at the top of his game, but he says he's still figuring it out.",
      "\"There's different versions of success. I think for many years success, for me, was, like, working on projects I really like [that] nobody really sees. Fly under the radar, but keep getting to do what I do. And now I'm like, 'Well, now I gotta figure out how to do the jobs I want but also make money.' It's really hard to find the way to do that!\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 17:54:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

More than 50 fertility doctors in the U.S. have been accused of using their own sperm to inseminate patients.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election\u00a0highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 05:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will make a rate cut decision on November 7. Here's what economists expect.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September.",
      "The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. That would bring the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money \u2014 down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.",
      "If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers.",
      "\"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. \"For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?",
      "Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report.",
      "Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025. That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",
      "The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",
      "\"As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.",

      "The shares have been on a wild ride since going public in March, initially surging and giving former president's 57% stake a value of\u00a0$5.2 billion.

      "In all but two elections since 1944, the party in the White House has retained power when the U.S. stock market advances before Election Day, or the period between the end of July and Halloween, according to an election predictor devised by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",

      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",

Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",

      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump may have joined the ranks of America's richest people through his real estate holdings, from golf courses to hotels, but it's his stake in the fledgling Trump Media & Technology Group that has more than doubled his net worth to $5.5 billion this year.",
      "The money-losing social media company, which trades under the ticker symbol DJT, the same as Trump's initials, has had a volatile year since going public in March. An initial surge in the market value of Trump Media in March made the former president's 57% stake worth\u00a0$5.2 billion, but that tumbled to $1.4 billion when the stock hit a low of $11.75 in September.",
      "The wild swings in Trump Media shares has prompted comparisons to meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than revenue or profit growth, investors' favored yardsticks. Trump Media, whose main asset is the Truth Social platform, has\u00a0declining revenue and large losses, with University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter telling CBS MoneyWatch that the \"stock is incredibly overvalued.\"",
      "Even so, Trump's wealth dwarfs that of his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who with her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is worth about $8 million, according to an estimate by Forbes. Harris' wealth stems from her decades in public service, book royalties and investments.",
      "Here's what to know about Trump's wealth.",
      "Trump's DJT shares",
      "Despite the roller coast in DJT shares, Trump's stake in the social network has helped lift his overall net worth to $5.5 billion, more than double his $2.4 billion in wealth at the start of 2024, according to Forbes.",
      "His stake in DJT shares, worth about $3.5 billion based on its November 1 closing price, remains his single largest financial asset. That's down from $5.9 billion when the shares touched a recent high of $51.51 on October 29. Since then, DJT stock has shed half its value.",
      "Because Trump has vowed not to sell\u00a0any DJT shares, his stock market wealth for now remains largely on paper.",
      "Where does Trump's wealth come from?",
      "Despite his billions in DJT stock, Trump's original fortune stems from real estate, spanning residential buildings in New York City to golf courses and hotels around the globe.",
      "Trump got his start working for his father, Fred Trump, a New York City real estate developer who built more than 27,000 apartments and row houses in Queens and Brooklyn, according to the New York Times. Trump claims his dad's loan of $1 million helped him build his own business, which now includes holdings such as the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and the Trump Tower in Manhattan.",
      "One of his largest assets is his $500 million stake in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, an office building in Manhattan, while his Trump National Doral Miami Golf Resort is worth about $300 million, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Trump's earnings from crypto, NFTs and Bibles",

      "A $59.99 Bible that Trump endorsed in partnership with singer Lee Greenwood earned him $300,000 in royalties, while he booked $4.5 million for \"Letters to Trump,\" a 2023 collection of letters sent to Trump over the years from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey.",
      "The financial disclosure forms also show that Trump continues to earn money from the reality show \"The Apprentice\" and his 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal.\" He receives a pension from the Screen Actors Guild of more than $90,000 annually.",
      "Despite the investments in crypto and NFTs, Trump's investments are largely held in stocks, index funds and bonds, including U.S. Treasuries, according to the form. He also owns at least $100,000 in gold bars.",
      "Trump's liabilities",
      "The disclosure forms, which are required of all presidential candidates, outlined liabilities including several mortgages on Trump Tower and other properties, as well as newer debts related to legal judgments.",
      "Trump is appealing a trio of judgments against him for more than half a billion dollars. They include a combined $88.3 million from two cases in which juries found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll, as well as a New York State case in which a judge ruled that Trump owes more than $450 million, including interest, for a fraud scheme.

      "Why is Election Day on a Tuesday?",
      "Americans continue to vote based largely on the needs of 19th century farmers. As Bloomberg's Claire Suddath noted, Election Day lands on the day deemed most convenient for those legally allowed to vote in 1845: White men.",
      "As the most common occupation 179 years ago was farming, and many attended church on Sunday but also needed a full day to ride into town to vote, Congress went with the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, when most planting and harvesting was done.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:39:13 -0500",
    "summary": "How the U.S. election plays out could have a major impact on the millions of Americans enrolled in Medicare. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "On the campaign trail, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are eager to portray themselves as guardians of Medicare. Each presidential candidate accuses the other of backing spending cuts and other policies that would damage the health insurance program for older Americans.",
      "But the election's outcome could alter the very nature of the nearly 60-year-old federal program. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are already enrolled in plans, called Medicare Advantage, run by commercial insurers, and if Trump wins, that proportion is expected to grow \u2014 perhaps dramatically.",
      "Trump and many congressional Republicans have already taken steps to aggressively promote Medicare Advantage. And Project 2025, a political wish list produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation for the next presidency, calls for making insurer-run plans the default enrollment option for Medicare.",
      "Such a change would effectively privatize the program, because people tend to stick with the plans they're initially enrolled in, health analysts say. Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself from Project 2025, though the document's authors include numerous people who worked in his first administration.",
      "Conservatives say Medicare beneficiaries are better off in the popular Advantage plans, which offer more benefits than the traditional, government-run program. Critics say increasing insurers' control of the program would trap consumers in health plans that are costlier to taxpayers and that can restrict their care, including by imposing onerous prior authorization requirements for some procedures.",
      "\"Traditional Medicare will wither on the vine,\" said Robert Berenson, a former official in the Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton administrations who's now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research group.",
      "While the fate of Medicare has gotten scant attention so far in the campaign, the different visions under Trump versus Harris indicate the high stakes.",
      "A candidate's position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the most important health care issue, or among the most important, in determining 63% of Americans' vote in the presidential election, according to a September poll by Gallup and West Health, a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations focused on health care and aging.",
      "Medicare, which covers about 66 million people, is funded largely by payroll taxes. At age 65, most Americans are automatically enrolled in Medicare coverage for hospitalization and doctor visits, known as Part A and Part B, though others must sign up. Consumers must also sign up for other aspects of Medicare, specifically drug coverage (Part D) and supplemental plans from insurers that pay for costs that aren't covered by traditional Medicare, such as extended stays in skilled nursing facilities and cost sharing.",
      "People on Medicare pay premiums plus as much as 20% of the cost of their care.",
      "Medicare Advantage plans typically combine coverage for hospital and outpatient care and prescriptions, while eliminating the 20% coinsurance requirement and capping customers' annual out-of-pocket costs. Many of the plans don't charge an extra monthly premium, though some carry a deductible \u2014 an amount patients must pay each year before coverage kicks in.",
      "Sometimes the plans throw in extras like coverage for eye exams and glasses or gym memberships.",
      "However, they control costs by limiting patients to networks of approved doctors and hospitals, with whom the plans negotiate payment rates. Some hospitals and doctors refuse to do business with some or all Medicare Advantage plans, making those networks narrow or limited. Traditional Medicare, in comparison, is accepted by nearly every hospital and doctor.",
      "Medicare's popularity is one reason both candidates are pledging to enhance it. Last month, Harris released a plan that would add benefits including care for hearing and vision, and long-term in-home health care. The costs would be covered by savings from expanding Medicare's negotiations with drugmakers, reducing fraud, and increasing discounts drugmakers pay for certain brand-name drugs in the program, according to Harris' campaign.",
      "Trump's campaign said he would prioritize home care benefits and support unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.",
      "The Trump campaign also noted enhancements to Medicare Advantage plans during his tenure as president, such as increasing access to telehealth and expanding supplemental benefits for seniors with chronic diseases.",
      "But far less attention has been paid to whether to give even more control of Medicare to private insurers. Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning research group, said \"a Trump administration and GOP Congress would be more friendly\" to the idea.",
      "The concept of letting private insurers run Medicare isn't new. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, asserted in 1995 that traditional Medicare would fade away if its beneficiaries could pick between the original program and private plans.",
      "The shift to Medicare Advantage was accelerated by legislation in 2003 that created Medicare's drug benefit and gave private health plans a far greater role in the program.",
      "Lawmakers thought private insurers could better contain costs. Instead, the plans have cost more. In 2023, Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers about 6% \u2014 or $27 billion \u2014 more than original Medicare, though some research shows they provide better care.",
      "The Trump administration promoted Medicare Advantage in emails during the program's open enrollment period each year, but support for the privately run plans has become bipartisan as they have grown.",
      "\"It helps inject needed competition into a government-run program and has proven to be more popular with those who switch,\" said Roger Severino, lead architect of Project 2025's section on the Department of Health and Human Services. He served as director of HHS' civil rights office during the Trump administration.",
      "But enrollees who want to switch back to traditional Medicare may not be able to. If they try to buy supplemental coverage for the 20% of costs Medicare doesn't cover, they may find they have to pay an unaffordable premium. Unless they enroll in the plans close to the time they first become eligible for Medicare, usually at age 65, insurers selling those supplemental plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of preexisting conditions.",
      "\"More members of Congress are hearing from constituents who are horrified and realize they are trapped in these plans,\" said Andrea Ducas, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy organization.",
      "[Correction: This article was updated at 10:20 a.m. ET on Nov. 4, 2024, to correct the amount Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers last year compared with original Medicare.]",

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 10:00:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, said she became addicted to kratom drink \"Feel Free Classic,\" after she sought an alcohol alternative.",
    "story": [
      "When Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, decided to stop drinking in June 2022, she turned to a kratom beverage advertised as an alcohol alternative. Within a year and a half, Adeoye said she was addicted to the drink, \"Feel Free Classic,\" lured by what she calls the company's deceptive marketing tactics.",
      "The 29-year-old account manager based in Austin, Texas, said her favorite podcasters promoted the drink, which the company Botanic Tonics manufactures and sells, as \"a miracle\" beverage that could help people trying to overcome addiction and embrace sobriety. Having struggled with binge drinking in the past, Adeoye was intrigued.",
      "She said she was unaware the drink contained kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that can produce feelings of energy, ease anxiety and reduce pain\u2014 but carries a risk of addiction, seizures, and very rarely, death. Since kratom is unregulated in the U.S., some products are sold in highly concentrated forms and could contain contaminants like heavy metals and harmful bacteria, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.",
      "Eventually, Adeoye says she was drinking up to 10 two-ounce bottles a day and spending around $100 daily. The company recommends consumers drink no more than a bottle daily. By then, she said, her life revolved around the drink and she needed to make sure she had access to it wherever she went.",
      "A drink advertised an #alcoholalternative",
      "Then came the withdrawals, which some consumers compare on social media to withdrawing from an opioid.",
      "\"When I would wake up, I'd be 'dope sick', essentially, and need to go straight to the gas station and go buy Feel Free to immediately feel better,\" Adeoye said.",
      "This past March, after one bout of withdrawal symptoms was so severe, she sought medical care close to her home in Austin. She hadn't told the doctors she was struggling with kratom use, she said, and they chalked her symptoms up to a virus.",
      "\"All of a sudden, it just spirals out of control and you get to a point where you feel like you can't live without them,\" she said. \"And you become just a shell of a person.\"",
      "Adeoye, who was trying to stay sober from alcohol, said she unwittingly found herself in the throes of addiction \u2014 and she's not the only one.",
      "A forum on the social network Reddit called r/quittingkratom has more than 45,000 members while a forum dedicated exclusively to quitting Feel Free has nearly 3,000. There are podcasts, support groups and books dedicated to quitting kratom.",
      "In 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in California against Botanic Tonics alleging that the drink was advertised as a safe alternative to alcohol. The company used social media to reach its \"desired customer base,\" the lawsuit states, which included individuals who had struggled with addiction. According to the 2023 suit, Botanic Tonics posted over a thousand advertisements on Instagram using the hashtag #alcoholalternative. The suit also says that advertisements on Instagram omitted any mention of kratom or potential side effects.",
      "CBS News spoke with another consumer about their experience with Feel Free Classic who also described the drink's appeal as an alcohol alternative, and said they had become addicted to the beverage and eventually experienced withdrawal symptoms.",
      "The company told CBS News in a statement it \"fell short of the high standards of transparency and consumer education that our company now champions.\" And they've taken steps for \"continuous improvement and doing what's right for consumers.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics said they'd implemented changes including enhanced labeling, raised age restrictions to 21 and over, investing in clinical research, expanded consumer education resources and maintained rigorous manufacturing standards in FDA-registered, cGMP-certified facilities.",
      "CBS News found through an internet search that Feel Free Classic was featured in at least 22 podcasts. The company's founder, JW Ross, has spoken openly with podcast hosts about his previous struggles with alcohol, and how Feel Free Classic was developed as an alternative.",
      "\"We make a powerful product. That product works for a lot of people, but it doesn't work for everyone,\" Botanic Tonics said in a statement to CBS News. \"Our priority as a company is making sure it gets into the right hands, which is why it's so important for us to focus on informing people who have issues with substance abuse that it isn't for them.\"",
      "Upon the lawsuit's settlement in September, Botanic Tonics said it would issue clear labels and warnings \u2014 but around the time Adeoye began taking Feel Free Classic and ultimately became hooked, the website advertised the drinks to be \"used for productivity enhancement or as a healthy alcohol alternative.\" As recently as January 2024, a banner on the website read \"cheers to a dry January.\"",
      "Kratom risks not fully known by the public",
      "Kratom is used by an estimated 2 million to 15 million Americans. As kratom's use rises in the U.S., so do the risks. The FDA warns the public against consuming kratom for medical use due to the risk of liver toxicity, seizures and substance use disorder; the DEA classifies it as a \"drug of concern\" and warns that it can lead to addiction. Botanic Tonics said, \"while leaf kratom can lead to physical dependence, its risk profile is significantly lower compared to many other commonly used substances.\" The company pointed CBS News to comparative safety practices and FDA studies available on the Global Kratom Coalition website, an advocacy group promoting the use of kratom.",
      "It is rare to overdose from kratom alone \u2013 a vast majority of the overdoses typically include an accompanying substance like alcohol or cocaine. But it does happen.",
      "Wrongful death suits in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington followed. The family of a Florida woman whose death in 2021 was attributed to a chemical compound found in kratom was awarded $11 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. Last year, $2.5 million was awarded in the first kratom wrongful death trial in the United States. A kratom company based in Washington State was found liable for negligence among other claims relating to the death of a 39-year-old who was found dead in his living room after consuming kratom.",
      "Despite kratom's potential for addiction and subsequent withdrawal symptoms, it has gained a reputation among the online sobriety community as a method to self-manage opioid withdrawal \u2014 which has not yet been scientifically proven.",
      "Adeoye said even though information about the dangers of kratom was readily available, she didn't understand the associated risks. If she could go back two years, she said, she would have researched the ingredients \"as heavily as possible.\"",
      "\"To my knowledge, it was something that was similar to matcha, like a tea or a coffee,\" Adeoye said. \"So, thought it was completely harmless.\"",
      "Scrutiny grows around kratom marketing",
      "Botanic Tonics isn't the only kratom product company that has come under scrutiny.",
      "In July, the FDA issued a warning advising consumers against using OPMS Black Liquid Kratom, which \"has been linked to serious adverse health effects, including death,\" according to the agency. Shot of Joy, which sells kratom shots, was issued a warning letter by the FDA in 2023 stating the company markets their products for the \"treatment or cure of opioid addiction\"\u2014 a claim the FDA says has not been determined by the agency. In a series of Instagram advertisements viewed by CBS News, Shot of Joy promotes their beverage as an alcohol alternative. The FDA has issued warning letters to ten companies that sell kratom products between 2019 and 2023.",
      "After nearly two years of silently struggling, Adeoye told her mom, and then her husband following that medical visit. She was ready to quit.",
      "She spent the next few days detoxing at home.",
      "\"I couldn't eat anything. My mom had to force me to eat,\" she said, noting that she had to have someone with her \"around the clock.\"",
      "Though the physical withdrawals tapered off after about three days she says it took six months to feel regulated mentally.",
      "\"It's very depressing to feel this emptiness,\" Adeoye said of quitting kratom. \"You feel like life is never going to be the same.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics'\u00a0 FAQ page now includes a section addressing past marketing practices.",
      "\"Our marketing strategy has changed dramatically in the past year, but not as a reaction to the lawsuit filing,\" the statement reads. \"As our business has grown, specifically in retail, we've shifted marketing focus accordingly.\"",

      "At the center of the discussions is the Justice Department's longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and the need to enable a smooth transition to a second term in the White House for Trump, the sources said.",
      "Regulations governing the special counsel dictate that the upper echelons of the Justice Department, including possibly Attorney General Merrick Garland, are to be consulted on major decisions in an investigation overseen by a special counsel. Smith's office declined to comment.",
      "Garland appointed Smith in November 2022 to take over the Justice Department's investigations involving Trump.",

      "In the prosecution involving government documents, which was brought in South Florida, Smith and his team claimed Trump unlawfully held onto dozens of records bearing classification markings after leaving the White House in January 2021 and worked with two staffers, who were charged alongside him, to impede the Justice Department's investigation. The staffers, aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty.",
      "The former president faced 40 charges, but they were all dismissed earlier this year when the judge overseeing the case, Aileen Cannon, ruled Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Smith appealed the ruling, and both sides have submitted filings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on the issue.",

Officials in Mr. Biden's camp later attributed the president's lackluster performance to a cold, which they said he'd had for several days, but Americans and some party and government leaders questioned whether the debate was a sign the 81-year-old politician would not be fit enough to serve a second term.",
      "The Butler assassination attempt",
      "While Mr. Biden faced mounting pressures to end his reelection campaign after the debate, there was another startling turn of events as\u00a0Trump was shot while speaking to a crowd of supporters from the podium of his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The assassination attempt against the former president left him with a graze wound to his ear, and killed one spectator at the rally and critically injured two others as Secret Service agents quickly rushed Trump from the stage.

      "\"They're eating the dogs ... they're eating the cats\"",
      "Among a medley of blatant falsehoods and baseless claims made by Trump during his debate against Harris was one that stood out from the rest. While speaking about immigration, the former president repeated a story that had been circulating on social media that alleged that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating people's pets.",
      "Trump, Vance and others had already amplified those rumors prior to the debate, where Trump doubled down, saying: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs \u2014 the people that came in, they're eating the cats.

      "As the presidential race neared a close at the end of October, Trump held a campaign rally at\u00a0Madison Square Garden\u00a0in New York City and vowed to win his home state in the election (which didn't happen).

      "The stunt, he said, was crafted \"in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden\" after Mr. Biden appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage,\" although the White House and Mr. Biden clarified that his remark was meant to be about the Madison Square Garden rally comedian.",

    "story": [
      "Former President Donald Trump's election victory and looming return to the White House will likely bring changes that scale back the nation's public health insurance programs \u2014 increasing the uninsured rate, while imposing new barriers to abortion and other reproductive care.",
      "The reverberations will be felt far beyond Washington, D.C., and could include an erosion of the Affordable Care Act's consumer protections, the imposition of work requirements in Medicaid and funding cuts to the safety net insurance, and challenges to federal agencies that safeguard public health. Abortion restrictions may tighten nationwide with a possible effort to restrict the mailing of abortion medications.",
      "And with the elevation of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Trump's inner circle of advisers, public health interventions with rigorous scientific backing \u2014 whether fluoridating public water supplies or inoculating children \u2014 could come under fire.",
      "Trump's victory will give a far broader platform to skeptics and critics of federal health programs and actions. Worst case, public health authorities worry, the U.S. could see increases in preventable illnesses; a weakening of public confidence in established science; and debunked notions \u2014 such as a link between vaccines and autism \u2014 adopted as policy. Trump said in an NBC News interview on Nov. 3 that he would \"make a decision\" about banning some vaccines, saying he would consult with Kennedy and calling him \"a very talented guy.\"",
      "While Trump has said he will not try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, his administration will face an immediate decision next year on whether to back an extension of enhanced premium subsidies for Obamacare insurance plans. Without the enhanced subsidies, steep premium increases causing lower enrollment are projected. The current uninsured rate, about 8%, would almost certainly rise.",
      "Policy specifics have not moved far beyond the \"concepts of a plan\" Trump said he had during his debate with Harris, though Vice President-elect JD Vance later said the administration would seek to inject more competition into ACA marketplaces.",
      "Republicans were projected to claim a Senate majority, in addition to the White House, while control of the House was not yet resolved early Wednesday.",
      "Polls show the ACA has gained support among the public, including provisions such as preexisting condition protections and allowing young people to stay on family health plans until they are 26.",
      "Trump supporters and others who have worked in his administration say the former president wants to improve the law in ways that will lower costs. They say he has already shown he will be forceful when it comes to lowering high health care prices, pointing to efforts during his presidency to pioneer price transparency in medical costs.",
      "\"On affordability, I'd see him building on the first term,\" said Brian Blase, who served as a Trump health adviser from 2017 to 2019. Relative to a Democratic administration, he said, there will be \"much more focus\" on \"minimizing fraud and waste.\"",
      "Efforts to weaken the ACA could include slashing funds for enrollment outreach, enabling consumers to purchase more health plans that don't comply with ACA consumer protections and allowing insurers to charge sicker people higher premiums.",
      "Democrats say they expect the worst.",
      "\"We know what their agenda is,\" said Leslie Dach, executive chair of Protect Our Care, a health care policy and advocacy organization in Washington, D.C. He worked in the Obama administration helping to implement the ACA. \"They're going to raise costs for millions of Americans and rip coverage away from millions and, meanwhile, they will give tax breaks to rich people.\"",
      "Theo Merkel, director of the Private Health Reform Initiative at the right-leaning Paragon Health Institute, which Blase leads, said the enhanced ACA subsidies extended by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 do nothing to improve plans or lower premiums. He said they paper over the plans' low value with larger government subsidies.",
      "Other Trump supporters say the president-elect may support preserving Medicare's authority to negotiate drug prices, another provision of the IRA. Trump has championed reducing drug prices, and in 2020 advanced a test model that would have tied the prices of some drugs in Medicare to lower costs overseas, said Merkel, who worked in Trump's first White House. The drug industry successfully sued to block the program.",
      "Within Trump's circles, some names have already been floated as possible leaders for the Department of Health and Human Services. They include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Seema Verma, who ran the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential run and endorsed Trump, has told his supporters that Trump promised him control of HHS. Trump said publicly before Election Day that he would give Kennedy a big role in his administration, but he may have difficulty winning Senate confirmation for a Cabinet position.",
      "While Trump has vowed to protect Medicare and said he supports funding home care benefits, he's been less specific about his intentions for Medicaid, which provides coverage to lower-income and disabled people. Some health analysts expect the program will be especially vulnerable to spending cuts, which could help finance the extension of tax breaks that expire at the end of next year.",
      "Possible changes include the imposition of work requirements on beneficiaries in some states. The administration and Republicans in Congress could also try to revamp the way Medicaid is funded. Now, the federal government pays states a variable percentage of program costs. Conservatives have long sought to cap the federal allotments to states, which critics say would lead to draconian cuts.",
      "\"Medicaid will be a big target in a Trump administration,\" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Less clear is the potential future of reproductive health rights.",
      "Trump has said decisions about abortion restrictions should be left to the states. Thirteen states ban abortion with few exceptions, while 28 others restrict the procedure based on gestational duration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights. Trump said before the election that he would not sign a national abortion ban.",
      "Trump could move to restrict access to abortion medications, used in more than half of abortions, either by withdrawing the FDA's authorization for the drugs or by enforcing a 19th-century law, the Comstock Act, that abortion opponents say bans their shipment. Trump has said he generally would not use the law to ban mail delivery of the drugs.",

      "Harris was expected to address supporters from Howard, the historically Black college where she graduated in 1986, on election night, but never made it to her alma mater as the results came rolling in. Instead, campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond sent the assembled crowd home and said Harris would speak on Wednesday.",
      "Election Day on Nov. 5 capped a chaotic and historic presidential election cycle that saw two assassination attempts against Trump and was roiled by Mr. Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would exit the race following a disastrous debate performance in late June.",
      "Harris swiftly announced her own candidacy for the White House, and Democrats quickly coalesced around her as their pick to take on Trump.

      "Nava, a Democrat, won New Mexico's state Senate contest in District 9, which includes a region just north of Albuquerque. She bested Republican candidate Audrey Trujillo with 55% of the vote,\u00a0according to results shared online by the New Mexico Secretary of State's office.",

      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST Monday, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",

      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",

      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 15:58:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election\u00a0highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter.

      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department and special counsel Jack Smith's office are engaged in active discussions about how to wind down the ongoing federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "At the center of the discussions is the Justice Department's longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and the need to enable a smooth transition to a second term in the White House for Trump, the sources said.",
      "Regulations governing the special counsel dictate that the upper echelons of the Justice Department, including possibly Attorney General Merrick Garland, are to be consulted on major decisions in an investigation overseen by a special counsel. Smith's office declined to comment.",
      "Garland appointed Smith in November 2022 to take over the Justice Department's investigations involving Trump.",
      "The president-elect was indicted on federal charges in two separate cases brought by Smith last year, the first involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government records and the second stemming from his purported efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The former president pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically motivated prosecution aimed at assisting President Biden's \u2014 and then Harris' \u2014 campaign against him.",
      "In the prosecution involving government documents, which was brought in South Florida, Smith and his team claimed Trump unlawfully held onto dozens of records bearing classification markings after leaving the White House in January 2021 and worked with two staffers, who were charged alongside him, to impede the Justice Department's investigation. The staffers, aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty.",
      "The former president faced 40 charges, but they were all dismissed earlier this year when the judge overseeing the case, Aileen Cannon, ruled Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Smith appealed the ruling, and both sides have submitted filings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on the issue.",
      "In the second case, brought in Washington, D.C., prosecutors claimed Trump mounted an illegal scheme to hold onto power for a second term after losing the 2020 election to Mr. Biden. Proceedings were paused for months, though, as Trump sought to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",
      "The Supreme Court weighed in on the matter in July, ruling that former presidents cannot face charges arising from official actions taken while in the White House, and the case resumed before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in August.",

Officials in Mr. Biden's camp later attributed the president's lackluster performance to a cold, which they said he'd had for several days, but Americans and some party and government leaders questioned whether the debate was a sign the 81-year-old politician would not be fit enough to serve a second term.",
      "The Butler assassination attempt",
      "While Mr. Biden faced mounting pressures to end his reelection campaign after the debate, there was another startling turn of events as\u00a0Trump was shot while speaking to a crowd of supporters from the podium of his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The assassination attempt against the former president left him with a graze wound to his ear, and killed one spectator at the rally and critically injured two others as Secret Service agents quickly rushed Trump from the stage.

The transition was marked by a neon green banner at the top of the social media profile bearing the title \"kamala hq.\" Its style and format imitated the cover of \"Brat,\" the album by British pop star Charli XCX whose then-recent viral tweet \u2014 \"Kamala IS brat\" \u2014 swept the Internet and sparked a frenzy of memes that seemed to engage Gen Z voters in a promising new way.",

      "\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\"",

      "\"'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'\" Harris said, quoting her mother. \"You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"",

At 17, he enlisted in the National Guard, serving for 24 years. He used his GI Bill benefits to go to college, and become a teacher. He served as both the football coach and the adviser of the Gay-Straight Alliance.\"",
      "Second apparent assassination attempt",

      "Trump and Harris sparred in a contentious presidential debate in Philadelphia on Sept. 11. The debate, hosted by ABC, saw the two candidates slashing over key issues like abortion rights, immigration, the economy and foreign policy.",
      "\"They're eating the dogs ... they're eating the cats\"",
      "Among a medley of blatant falsehoods and baseless claims made by Trump during his debate against Harris was one that stood out from the rest. While speaking about immigration, the former president repeated a story that had been circulating on social media that alleged that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating people's pets.",
      "Trump, Vance and others had already amplified those rumors prior to the debate, where Trump doubled down, saying: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs \u2014 the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating \u2014 they're eating the pets of the people that live there and this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.\"",

      "As the presidential race neared a close at the end of October, Trump held a campaign rally at\u00a0Madison Square Garden\u00a0in New York City and vowed to win his home state in the election (which didn't happen).

      "The stunt, he said, was crafted \"in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden\" after Mr. Biden appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage,\" although the White House and Mr. Biden clarified that his remark was meant to be about the Madison Square Garden rally comedian.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 23:31:51 -0500",
    "summary": "A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid\u200b, a government official said Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said Wednesday.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them.",
      "Outcry over plea deal for 9/11 defendants",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others when announced in late July.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have been one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties, including years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",
      "The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary.",
      "The New York Times first reported the ruling.",
      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site.",
      "However, a legal blog that long has covered the prosecutions from the Guantanamo courtroom said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the authority to toss out the plea deals.",
      "The ruling also calls the timing of Austin's move \"fatal,\" coming after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals, according to the blog, called Lawdragon.",

    "story": [
      "Climate scientists working at the European Union's\u00a0Copernicus Climate Change Service\u00a0have announced that 2024 is \"virtually certain\" to be the warmest year on record.",
      "According to its ERA5 dataset, the agency said it was \"virtually certain\" that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, and it will likely be more than 1.55 C above.",
      "For decades, scientists have warned that average global temperatures should not get any higher than 1.5 C above pre-industrial times in order to prevent deadly weather conditions that could impact people worldwide.",
      "The world has already warmed considerably and has seen the effects with back-to-back heat waves, droughts and\u00a0unprecedented flooding and hurricane events. The way farmers are able to grow food has already started to shift, and with\u00a01.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, agricultural yields will decline and sea levels could rise up to 10 feet, researchers have found. Experts say the oceans will also be warmer, fueling more powerful hurricanes and threatening ecosystems that are fundamental for economies and help protect areas from inclement weather.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to raise ambition for the upcoming Climate Change Conference, COP29,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement.",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service said the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) is 0.71 C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.16 C warmer than the same period in 2023.",
      "\"The average temperature anomaly for the rest of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 to not be the warmest year,\" the agency said.",
      "The agency added that given that 2023 was 1.48\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level according to its ERA5 model, it was also likely that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.55\u00b0C above.",
      "European temperatures were above average over almost all of the continent, Copernicus found. Outside Europe, temperatures were most above average over northern Canada, and well-above average over the central and western United States, northern Tibet, Japan and Australia.",
      "The agency also said Arctic sea ice reached its fourth lowest monthly extent for October, at 19% below average. Sea ice extent is a measure of the surface area of the ocean which is covered by ice.",
      "Sea ice concentration anomalies were well below average in all peripheral seas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of Svalbard, the agency said.",
      "Antarctic sea ice extent was 8% below average in October, which was the second-lowest such average behind only October 2023, when it was 11% below average, Copernicus said. Those numbers continued \"a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.\"",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is funded by the EU, routinely publishes monthly climate bulletins reporting on changes observed in global surface air and sea temperatures, sea ice cover and hydrological variables. All the reported findings are based on computer-generated analyses and the ERA5 dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.",
      "In a\u00a0report\u00a0published last month, the United Nations warned that the world is now in \"climate crunch time\" as greenhouse gases \u2014 which trap heat in the atmosphere that warms global temperatures and fuels more extreme weather events \u2014 have hit \"unprecedented levels.\"",
      "\"The numbers paint a clear picture,\" the U.N. said. \"To keep emissions below the\u00a0critical 1.5-degree target\u00a0set in Paris in 2015, countries must cut emissions by 42 percent overall by 2030 and achieve a 57 percent reduction by 2035.\"",

      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 04:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "From enthusiasm from Israel's leader to thinly veiled anxiety from some of America's oldest European allies, foreign reaction to Trump's election victory is rolling in fast.",
    "story": [
      "With former President Donald Trump set to reprise his role as the commander in chief of the world's most powerful military and largest economy \u2014 and with him wasting no time in claiming victory in the\u00a0U.S. presidential election \u2014 leaders around the world started reacting Wednesday to the reality of a second term in the White House for the businessman-turned politician.",
      "From enthusiasm voiced by Israel's leader as he wages an expanding, multi-front war to anxiety from some of America's closest, generations-old European allies, the reaction to Trump's election performance started rolling in long before the final votes were counted across the U.S.",
      "Below is a look at how some foreign leaders and governments around the world have taken the news of the American electorate's apparent rebuke of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party at the polls.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to Trump on Wednesday, calling his election performance \"history's greatest comeback!\"",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a huge victory!\"",
      "Later Wednesday Netanyahu's spokesperson said the Israeli prime minister had been among the first foreign leaders to call Trump and offer his congratulations personally.",
      "\"The conversation was warm and cordial,\" Netanyahu's office said, adding that the two men had \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Despite Trump's criticism of the Israeli leader's handling of the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu was widely believed to favor the former U.S. leader in the U.S. election. Tension between Washington and Tel Aviv has risen sharply over the last year, with President Biden and others criticising Israel's tactics in its multi-front war with Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap about 250 others, has now killed more than 43,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also significantly ramped-up its assault on Hezbollah, Hamas' fellow-Iranian backed allies in Lebanon. The Israeli offensive there has killed more than 3,000 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "The Biden administration has continued pushing for cease-fires on both fronts, to no avail, and demanding that Israel do more to mitigate the devastating impact of the wars on civilians.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",
      "Ukraine's war-time President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Trump Wednesday for what he called an \"impressive election victory,\" and said he looked forward to \"an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.\"",
      "\"I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that his country was interested \"in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.\"",
      "\"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" said the Ukrainian leader. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"",
      "Zelenskyy offered no comment on Trump's repeated vows to \"quickly\" end the nearly three-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. His government and his commanders on the battlefield have voiced growing concern that Trump could dramatically reduce or even halt the huge American support for Ukraine's military effort to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy has warned that if the resolve of Ukraine's Western backers crumbles and Russia is allowed to seize Ukrainian territory, the war his country is fighting could spread, with direct implications for Americans.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" he told CBS News early this year.",
      "Hungary's President Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
      "One of the first foreign leaders to offer congratulations to Trump on Wednesday was one of the very few who openly backed him long before the final votes were cast in the U.S. Hungary's far-right President Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who's been accused during his decades-long leadership of the eastern European nation of eroding its democratic institutions by giving himself more power and limiting that of the country's courts and civil society institutions, called Trump's apparent success \"a much needed victory for the World!\"",
      "In a message posted on social media, Orb\u00e1n said Trump had pulled off \"the biggest comeback in US political history,\" and he congratulated him on his \"enormous win.\"",
      "Orban has made himself an outsider among European Union leaders by endorsing anti-immigrant policies and maintaining close ties with President Vladimir Putin amid Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 all while touting his close ties to Trump.",
      "In a speech over the summer, Orb\u00e1n suggested he had even helped to craft Trump's future statecraft, claiming to have \"entered the policy-writing system of President Donald Trump's team,\" with \"deep involvement there.\"",
      "Russia, but not Putin himself",
      "Leonid Slutsky, who heads the Committee on International Affairs in Russia's State Duma, or parliament, was quoted Wednesday by the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency as saying a Trump victory offered \"a chance for a more constructive approach to the Ukrainian conflict.\"",
      "\"Can we expect changes in approaches to the role of the U.S. in the Ukrainian conflict, which has been fueled by the Democratic administration since 2014? Judging by the election rhetoric (if it can still be believed), the Republican team is not going to send more and more American taxpayers' money into the furnace of a proxy war against Russia,\" Slutsky was quoted as saying. \"Perhaps there is a chance for a more constructive approach here.\"",
      "Slutsky did not comment on Trump's repeated vows to end the war in Ukraine quickly if reelected \u2014 something European and Ukrainian leaders fear he could do by halting America's vast military support for Kyiv and forcing Ukraine to accept Russia's takeover of significant Ukrainian territory.",
      "Slutsky did predict, however, that if the next American administration does cut off that support, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fall \"in a matter of months, if not days.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from President Vladimir Putin, who never spoke in favor of either candidate during the U.S. election campaign process, but whose leadership Trump has lauded previously.",
      "In remarks later to journalists in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of any plans for Putin to congratulate Trump directly, saying the former U.S. leader had made \"quite harsh statements\" about Russia during the campaign and calling the U.S. an \"unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.\"",
      "In a statement issued later, Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed that stance, saying: \"We have no illusions about the elected American President, who is well known in Russia, and the new composition of Congress, where the Republicans, according to preliminary data, are gaining the upper hand. The ruling political elite in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, adheres to anti-Russian attitudes and a line on 'containing Moscow.' This line is not subject to fluctuations in the domestic political barometer in the United States.\"",
      "The ministry said Russia would \"work with the new Administration when it 'settles' in the White House, firmly defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the goals of the special military operation.\"",
      "In his remarks, however, Peskov left room for any change in the U.S. stance during Trump's second term, saying: \"After victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone.\"",
      "\"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,\" he said, adding that it would be \"practically impossible\" for Trump to damage U.S. relations with Moscow, as they're \"at their lowest point in history.\"",
      "China, via the Foreign Ministry",
      "\"We will continue to view and handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and cooperation for win-win,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday. \"We respect the choice of the American people and congratulate Mr. Trump on his election as president.\"",
      "There was no immediate public reaction from President Xi Jinping. Trump has often described China as a primary U.S. adversary, and he's has pledged to continue a tit-for-tat tariff feud with the Asian nation.",
      "trUnder President Biden, the U.S. tightened export controls to try to\u00a0keep some sensitive U.S. technology out of China, and tension between Washington and Beijing has increased in recent years over China's stance on Taiwan, the democratically ruled island off its east coast that Xi has vowed to bring back under the control of the Chinese government for the first time in about 70 years.",
      "The U.S. is bound by American law to defend Taiwan from any military aggression, but Trump has never committed to doing so in the case of a Chinese invasion.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Trump on Wednesday, saying he was \"confident that the longstanding\u00a0#Taiwan-#US\u00a0partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.\"",
      "The United States is bound by domestic law to back Taiwan, an island off China's eastern coast that's claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory but which has had its own democratic government for decades, if it faces military aggression.",
      "China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under the rule of his Communist Party, by force if necessary, creating one of the most risky global military standoffs on the planet. Chinese and Taiwanese military vessels and aircraft have regularly entered each others' territory in recent months, increasing the tension as U.S. vessels continue \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the region.",
      "During and before the campaign, Trump dodged questions about whether the U.S. would come to the aid of Taiwan if China launched an invasion with him in the White House. In a July interview with The Associated Press,\u00a0he said\u00a0Taiwan should pay the U.S. more for helping ensure its defense.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Trump's reelection was \"no cause for concern\" for Mexico, despite the president-elect's recent threat to impose a massive 25% tariff on Mexican imports unless her government halts what he called an \"onslaught of criminals and drugs\" coming across the southern U.S. border.",
      "\"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that she felt it was \"prudent to wait\" to extend congratulations to the U.S. election winner until the official results were announced.",
      "\"For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the U.S.], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen, there is no cause for concern,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did his best Wednesday, despite a clear delineation between his own policies and those expected of another Trump administration, to maintain the decorum of the storied \"special friendship\" between the two nations.",
      "In a social media post, Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump \"on your historic election victory,\" adding that he looks forward to \"working with you in the years ahead.\"",
      "\"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" said Starmer, who came to power only months ago as Britain's left-leaning Labour Party won national elections in a landslide after a decade and a half of Conservative Party rule.",
      "\"I know that the US-UK special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,\" added Starmer.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,\" France's President Emmanuel Macron said in a brief statement posted on social media Wednesday. He declared his administration \"ready to work together\" again as it did during Trump's first term in office, \"with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.\"",
      "But an hour later, the French president issued another statement that hinted at the concerns he and many of his European colleagues are likely to share about Trump's commitment to the transatlantic NATO alliance, America's future backing of Ukraine in the war with Russia, and his stance on foreign import tariffs.",
      "In his second tweet, Macron said he had just spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, and that the leaders of the EU's two biggest economies had agreed to \"work towards a more united, stronger, more sovereign Europe in this new context. By cooperating with the United States of America and defending our interests and our values.\"",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte",
      "\"I just congratulated @realDonaldTrump on his election as President of the United States,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday, adding in his social media post that Trump's \"leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO.\"",
      "Trump has criticized many of the NATO alliance's European members for failing to commit at least 2% of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "Trump shocked many of America's closest allies during and after his first term by openly criticizing\u00a0their funding commitments, and during the 2024 presidential campaign he said calling on allies to increase their defense spending would be a policy he aggressively pursued if reelected.",
      "In May, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up,\" and that if reelected, \"he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"",
      "Iran's government and people",
      "Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's ruling Islamic regime, appeared on the country's state-run TV network IRIB Wednesday and was quoted as dismissing the potential impact of Trump's election victory amid her country's standoff with the West over its support for armed proxy groups across the Middle East and its nuclear program.",
      "\"The election of the U.S. President is not relevant to us,\" she said according to a translation of her remarks on state media. She said the policies of both the U.S. and Iran were \"fixed and do not change with the change of individuals,\" and said there would be be no \"impact on people's livelihoods\" in Iran regardless of who occupies the White House.",
      "Iran's economy has been decimated by a huge regime of U.S. and international sanctions imposed initially over its alleged nuclear weapons development \u2014 which the country denies \u2014 and extended over its support for U.S.-designated terror groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "During Donald Trump's first term in office, he unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of an international nuclear pact negotiated by his predecessor that was intended to keep Iran's atomic work in check in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He adopted a hard line instead, re-imposing sanctions to the consternation of America's European allies who helped broker and co-signed the deal.",
      "Iran has since ramped up its nuclear work, and there has been mounting concern this year that its backing for the so-called proxy groups across the Mideast could lead to a full-scale war with Israel, with the potential to draw in the U.S. as Israel's closest ally.",
      "Despite the government's claim that there would be no impact on Iranians, the value of the country's currency, the rial, slipped on Wednesday to its lowest ever value.",
      "Traders in Tehran told The Associated Press that the rial was trading at 703,000 to the dollar, though there could be further fluctuations over the course of the day.",
      "One resident of Iran's capital told the AP he had no doubt that Trump \"will intensify the sanctions.\"",
      "\"Things that are not in our favor will be worse,\" 22-year-old student Amir Aghaeian told the AP. \"Our economy and social situation will surely get worse... I feel the country is going to blow up.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza residents",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority that administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Trump on his reelection and wished him success.",
      "In his message, posted Wednesday on the website of the Authority's\u00a0news agency WAFA, Abbas expressed hope to work with Trump for peace and security in the region, stressing the Palestinian people's commitment to the pursuit of \"freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.\"",
      "\"We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,\" he said, addressing Trump.",
      "While nearly two-thirds of Israelis polled by the Israel Democracy Institute before election day in the U.S. said they believed Trump would be a better American leader for Israel's interests, the sentiment in Gaza, where Abbas' Fatah movement hasn't held any power in many years, was less focused on who would win, and more on surviving the war.",
      "A woman living amid the rubble in Gaza told CBS News this week that they just want the bombs to stop falling, and many were doubtful that a change in U.S. leadership could precipitate that.",
      "\"For me, Republicans or Democrats are the same thing,\" Gaza resident Firas Abu Firas said before election day. \"They are two faces on the same coin.\"",
      "Hamas reacts",
      "Basem Naim, a long-time senior figure in the Hamas regime that ruled over the Palestinian Gaza Strip for almost two decades before the group sparked the ongoing war with Israel with its unprecedented terrorist attack more than a year ago, called Trump's reelection, \"a private matter for the Americans,\" but said in a statement Wednesday that \"Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"",
      "International diplomatic efforts toward a so-called \"two-state solution,\" which would see an independent state of Palestine created alongside Israel, have all but vanished amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "U.S. administrations from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for such a solution to the nearly seven-decade crisis in the heart of the Middle East, but with the current Israeli administration firmly opposed to the notion of Palestinian statehood, most Palestinians saw little reason for hope regardless of who won the U.S. election.",
      "European Union's Ursula von der Leyen",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Union bloc's governing body, the European Commission, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and iterated her hope in a brief\u00a0social media post\u00a0that the U.S. and EU could \"work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering\" for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump. The EU and the US are more than just allies,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.\"",
      "Italian premier Giorgia Meloni",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni congratulated Trump Wednesday, lauding what she called \"unshakeable\" ties between the U.S. and Italy.",
      "\"Italy and the United States are 'sister' nations, linked by an unshakeable alliance, common values and a historic friendship. It is a strategic bond which I am sure we will now strengthen even more,\" Italy's far-right leader wrote in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated \"my friend Donald Trump\" Wednesday with a message posted on social media.",
      "The leader of the sometimes contentious NATO ally, who's taken a strong stance against Israel's handling of the ongoing wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, voiced his hope that \"Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crises and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.\"",
      "\"I believe that more efforts will be made for a more just world,\" said Erdogan. \"I hope that the elections will be beneficial for our friendly and allied people in the United States and for all of humanity.\"",
      "Trump and Erdogan appeared to get along relatively well during the American's first term in office.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro",
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro congratulated Trump on Wednesday and lauded the U.S. democratic process, which he said would be respected, but took the opportunity also to challenge the president-elect's vows to close the U.S. border to undocumented migrants as unrealistic.",
      "\"The only way to seal the boarders is through the prosperity of the communities of the south and the end of blockades,\" he said.",
      "Petro also alluded to concerns that Trump will lead the world's biggest economy further away from goals to address man-made climate change, saying the dialogue between the global north and south continues, \"and the reality of the climate collapse will force us to rally around a solution.\"",
      "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva",
      "Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known widely simply as Lula, offered his congratulations to Trump Wednesday \"on his election victory and return to the presidency of the United States.\"",
      "\"Democracy is the voice of the people and must always be respected,\" said the Brazilian leader, who is currently serving a third term after returning to office last year in an election that saw him defeat far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who was often compared to Trump.",
      "\"The world needs dialogue and joint work to achieve greater peace, development and prosperity. I wish the new government luck and success,\" da Silva said in his tweet.",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban regime",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, who stormed back into power after 20 years of U.S.-backed governance a year after the first Trump administration signed a peace agreement with the group in 2020, said Wednesday that it hoped for more cordial relations with Washington with his return to the White House.",
      "In a statement, the Taliban's foreign ministry voiced hope that \"the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual engagement.\"",
      "The Taliban, whose rule over Afghanistan has not been formally recognized by the U.S. or most other nations, noted Trump's role in getting the 2020 Doha Agreement peace deal and said \"it is expected that Mr. Trump will assume a constructive role in ending the current conflicts in the region & globally, particularly the ongoing brutality & aggression in Gaza & Lebanon.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region.",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival. Netanyahu cited \"significant gaps\" and a \"crisis of trust\" between the men in his Tuesday evening announcement.",
      "\"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,\" Netanyahu said. \"Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.\"",
      "In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for a diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group.",
      "Gallant, a former general who has gained public respect with a gruff, no-nonsense personality, said in a statement: \"The security of the state of Israel always was, and will always remain, my life's mission.\"",
      "The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Galant \"an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.\"",
      "\"As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel's next Minister of Defense,\" the White House National Security Council said.",
      "Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.",
      "A previous attempt by Netanyahu to fire Gallant in March 2023 sparked widespread street protests against Netanyahu. He also flirted with the idea of dismissing Gallant over the summer but held off until Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Gallant will be replaced by Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister who was a junior officer in the military. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu rival who recently rejoined the government, will take the foreign affairs post.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 Israeli strikes killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including on a home where displaced families were sheltering, health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory said Tuesday. Ten people were killed early Tuesday, including four children and two women, and a strike late Monday on the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya killed at least 20 people, including eight women and six children, the health officials said.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a weapons storage facility in northern Gaza from which a militant had operated, and that \"numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.\"",
      "Israel has been waging a massive offensive in northern Gaza \u2014 which was already the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory \u2014 for nearly a month.",
      "Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon, intensified Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah militant group are expanding beyond Lebanon's border areas as Israel continues fighting its war against Hamas in Gaza, with no end in sight.",
      "Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, when the Iran-backed Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, according to the country's Health Ministry.",
      "More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed over 43,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties, but says more than half of those killed have been women and children.",
      "The war was sparked by Hamas and allied militants storming into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and abducting 250 others.",
      "Fleeing Palestinians describe dire conditions in north Gaza",
      "Dozens of Palestinians trickled southward from war-ravaged northern Gaza Tuesday, recounting how they had hardly eaten in days with aid long cut off to the area under heavy Israeli bombardment.",
      "In the far northern town of Beit Lahiya, mostly women and children dragged rucksacks and satchels with belongings as they walked down a street where every building had been completely flattened or partially destroyed.",
      "\"We came barefoot. We have no sandals, no clothes, nothing. We have no money. There is no food or drink,\" said Huda Abu Laila, who along with the others was headed toward Gaza City.",
      "\"We are hungry. Hunger has killed us. We were under siege for one month without water or food,\" the gaunt elderly women continued, before erupting in tears.",
      "Israel launched its new offensive in northern Gaza in early October, focusing on Jabaliya, a densely populated, decades-old urban refugee camp where it says Hamas had regrouped.",
      "The U.N. estimated last week that some 100,000 people remained in the affected area. It has said no aid has reached the far north of the Palestinian territory for weeks. On Monday, the Gaza health ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews currently operating north of Gaza City.",
      "Israel has repeatedly issued evacuation warnings for the entirety of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, where several hundred thousand more Palestinians remain.",

    "story": [
      "Kokotela, South Africa\u00a0\u2014 Powering up is something most of us take for granted, but hundreds of millions of people across parts of Africa living without reliable access to electricity. An American company is working to change that, and their innovation is a contender for this year's annual Earthshot Prize, an award handed out by Britain's Prince William to highlight solutions to the climate crisis.",
      "Like most 12-year-olds, Dimakatso Ngcobo isn't a fan of household chores. She wasn't shy about telling CBS News so as she scrubbed an old pot, a few plastic plates and two old peanut butter jars that she and her mom use as cups.",
      "Last year, her mom couldn't afford the rent at their home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, so they were evicted. The mother and daughter walked to the community of Kokotela, a few miles further south, to buy a tiny dirt patch of land for $200. There, they put up a new one-room home made of metal sheeting.",
      "Ngcobo told CBS News that while there's no running water and no toilet, what she missed the most was electricity.",
      "\"It is a bit hard. We don't have much. We don't afford that much,\" she said, adding on a more positive note: \"At least the school nearby is OK, as I want to be a doctor one day.\"",
      "She was also grateful for her world getting just a little bit brighter recently, thanks to the U.S. company d.light, which was created by two co-founders who met at Stanford University's school of design. The company has now connected more than 180 million people in 70 countries to a clean source of energy from solar power.",
      "\"We are very focused on making these products as affordable as possible, and the way we do that is by pay-as-you-go financing, where customers can pay 20 cents a day or 30 cents per day, similar to what they would spend on kerosene or diesel for the diesel generator,\" said d.light co-founder Nedjip Tozun. \"But instead of literally burning away that money, they can invest it into an asset that they are going to own that is going to deliver power for many years.\"",
      "D.light is one of the 15\u00a0finalists in the running for a 2024 Earthshot Prize. Winners will be chosen Wednesday in five categories: Protect and Restore Nature, Clean Our Air, Revive Our Oceans, Build a Waste-Free World and Fix our Climate. The winner in each category will be awarded 1 million U.K. pounds, or about $1.3 million, intended to help scale-up their respective projects.",
      "William, the Prince of Wales and future British monarch, has said he took inspiration from President John F. Kennedy's 1962 \"Moonshot\" challenge to land a man on the moon within 10 years when he created the Earthshot Prize four years ago with the ambition of finding and elevating innovative global climate solutions. The Earthshot initiative's ambitious goal since it launched has been to repair the planet within 10 years.",
      "The Earthshot award ceremony has come to the African continent for the first time this year, with Cape Town in South Africa playing host.",
      "Delegates at the Earthshot awards in Cape Town told CBS News ahead of Tuesday's U.S. national election that they've been disappointed that climate change didn't emerge as a central theme in the presidential race, and they worry it could fall even further from the focus of U.S. policy conversation.",
      "New Yorker Shantha Bloemen, CEO of Mobility for Africa, a start-up that provides green mobility services to rural women in Africa using custom-built electric tricycles and bespoke solar powered batteries, was nominated for an award this year but didn't make the finalist list. She said she was still hoping to find partners in Cape Town this week to help her scale up her company's operations.",
      "\"We need urgent action and strong political leadership to unlock the financing to combat this crisis,\" she told CBS News. \"There are many of us with proven solutions to mitigate the worst impact on those living on the front line of the crisis, but without strong U.S. political leadership, it will be difficult to unlock the finance needed to scale quickly to succeed. Time is not on our side.\"",
      "Prince William acknowledged the networking aspect of the prize initiative Tuesday at an event in Cape Town. Panel host Wanjira Mathia teased the British royal as he sat for a panel discussion, calling the prize \"a large dating service to bring together climate innovators.\"",
      "\"The prize is about visibility, but it's also about scale,\" he said. \"What we hear a lot from innovators is, 'I have a solution and no idea how to scale,' and businesses and leaders who say, 'I have money but don't know where to put it.' So, that's where we created a launchpad, which is a dating service which matches the funder with the solution, and vice versa. And I think this collaboration is key \u2014 if you put all of this into one melting pot, then sparks will fly.\"",
      "\"It's wonderful to see those many brilliant minds and changemakers in a room,\" he said, addressing the audience.",
      "Back in Kokotela, south of Johannesburg, Muriel Nobela can now power her TV, radio and lights thanks to a d.light solar panel on her roof. The panel feeds electricity to an outside light and to a storage battery inside her home, and it all costs her just over $250, which she's paying off in small monthly instalments.",
      "Her neighbor Portia Msomi had always been forced to rely on gas to cook and candles for light in the evenings. Now, it's just a flip of a switch.",
      "\"Aha!\" said Portia, giggling as she hit her new d.light switch to illuminate her home. \"You see, isn't it wonderful!\"",
      "Tozun told CBS News it's that kind of reaction that drives d.light's work.",
      "\"The name of our company is d.light, and that is the emotion that gets us really excited to see in our customers,\" he said, adding: \"There are 2 billion people in the world who have unreliable electricity access, and about 750 million with no access to electricity at all, our goal is\u00a0 to transform the lives of one billion people by 2030.\"",
      "Portia takes a lot of pride in her new solar system. With a huge amount of effort she climbed onto a large trunk to stretch her hand onto her metal roof to grab her solar panel and clean it meticulously. She told CBS News it took her only four months to pay off the $150 cost of the system.",
      "She pointed to various neighbors' homes that had burned down in accidents involving paraffin and candle fires.",
      "\"We are safe now, and have light all the time,\" she said.",
      "Light and safety are important for young Dimakatso Ngcobo, too, but the 12-year-old told CBS News that being connected was one of the biggest benefits of clean power in her home. She can now indulge in her favorite activity: scrolling through TikTok and Instagram.",
      "\"And I love TV,\" she added. \"I really love cartoons.\"",
      "Her infectious laugh also helped to light up the room.",
      "\"I feel happy now,\" she said. \"We don't have much, butI can watch TikTok and dream about my future.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 08:12:04 -0500",
    "summary": "While Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to keep current limits on asylum, former President Donald Trump has vowed to seal the southern border altogether.",
    "story": [
      "Nogales, Mexico \u2014 Migrants from all corners of the globe, from Latin America to far-flung countries in Africa and Asia, come to a shelter in this northern Mexican city hoping to enter the U.S. and escape economic hardship and, in some cases, deadly danger.",
      "\"They tried to kill us,\" said Rosa Benalcazar, a migrant staying at the House of Mercy and all Nations, one of the biggest shelters for migrants on the Mexican side of the Arizona-Mexico border.",
      "Benalcazar said she journeyed to the U.S. after criminal gangs threatened to harm her and her family in Ecuador, which has seen record numbers of its citizens flee amid mounting violence and insecurity.",
      "Like the other migrants at the shelter in Nogales, Benalcazar has been trying to get an appointment to enter America through a U.S. government phone app known as CBP One. Designed to discourage illegal border crossings, the Biden administration program allows migrants in Mexico to request a time to be processed at a legal entry point. The wait times, however, can extend for months due to an extraordinarily high demand.",
      "\"I haven't had luck,\" Benalcazar said in Spanish, noting she's been attempting to secure a CBP One appointment each day for seven months straight.",
      "Sister Lika Macias, the shelter's director, said many migrants feel that luck may soon become harder to find, given the presidential election in the U.S.",
      "\"The politics in the United States,\" affect \"migration policy\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, Macias said.",
      "Vice President Harris has promised to continue current Biden administration policies that sharply limit asylum for those who cross the southern border without waiting for a CBP One appointment. But former President Donald Trump has vowed to seal the U.S.-Mexico border altogether, including by ending the CBP One process and other programs that allow migrants to enter the country lawfully.",
      "\"There's a lot of concern\"",
      "On a recent morning, immigration attorney Alba Jaramillo sought to ease the confusion and anxiety among those at the shelter. The American election could go \"either way\" and there's no telling who will win, she told a group of migrants, most of them mothers with children.",
      "Jaramillo urged the migrants to be patient and to avoid listening to social media rumors about a sudden, overnight U.S. policy change.",
      "\"There's a lot of concern about what's going to happen,\" said Jaramillo, the co-director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant group. \"They're very scared. They think that the asylum system is going to close.\"",
      "Jaramillo said she also urged migrants to follow the legal process and refrain from crossing the U.S. border illegally with the help of smugglers. Crossing the Arizona desert, she said, is not only dangerous, and potentially deadly, but would also disqualify migrants from asylum under an executive action by President Biden in June.",
      "After Mr. Biden enacted those broad restrictions on asylum, illegal border crossings, which had soared to record levels late last year, plunged to a 4-year low. While unauthorized crossings have remained at that low level for the past few months, U.S. officials worry the results of the presidential election could disrupt the lull.",
      "A Trump victory, some U.S. officials believe, could prompt large numbers of migrants to try to cross into the country illegally before he takes office in January. In addition to promising to shut down the CBP One app process, Trump has vowed to reinstate his hardline immigration policies, militarize the border and oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "\"It's nerve-racking\"",
      "Roughly half the migrants at the shelter are children, according to Macias, the facility's director. While their parents desperately await the results of the election, fearing dramatic changes in American border policy, the kids' only focus is being kids.",
      "After all, for the children, there's little to fear at the Nogales shelter, where they can learn English and mathematics and enjoy outdoor activities like soccer and basketball, as well as occasional treats.",
      "Still, parents like Areli Doral, a young mother from Guerrero, Mexico, remain deeply concerned about what could happen following the American election.",
      "\"Yes, I'm scared,\" Doral said in Spanish, while holding her two-year-old son, Edgar.",
      "\"If they close the (CBP One) application, what are we going to do? We already waited 10 months,\" she said. \"It's nerve-racking.\"",
      "Doral said returning to her hometown is not an option, noting it would be dangerous for her son.",
      "\"There's a lot of crime,\" she said. \"It's become more difficult where I'm from.\"",

      "Mexico's National Guard fatally shot two Colombians and wounded four others in what the Defense Department claimed was a confrontation near the U.S. border.",
      "Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that all of the victims were migrants who had been \"caught in the crossfire.\" It identified the dead as a 20-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, and gave the number of Colombians wounded as five, not four. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The victims were identified by the foreign ministry as Yuli Vanessa Herrera Marulanda and Ronaldo Andr\u00e9s Quintero Pe\u00f1uelas.",
      "Mexico's Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, did not respond to requests for comment Monday on whether the victims were migrants, but it said one Colombian who was not injured in the shootings was turned over to immigration officials, suggesting they were.",
      "If they were migrants, it would mark the second time in just over a month that military forces in Mexico have opened fire on and killed migrants.",
      "On Oct. 1, the day President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, soldiers opened fire on a truck, killing six migrants in the southern state of Chiapas. An 11-year-old girl from Egypt, her 18-year-old sister and a 17-year-old boy from El Salvador died in that shooting, along with people from Peru and Honduras.",
      "The most recent shootings happened Saturday on a dirt road near Tecate, east of Otay Mesa on the California border, that is frequently used by Mexican migrant smugglers, the department said in a statement late Sunday.",
      "The Defense Department said a militarized National Guard patrol came under fire after spotting two vehicles -- a gray pickup and a white SUV -- in the area, which is near an informal border crossing and wind power generation plant known as La Rumorosa.",
      "One truck sped off and escaped. The National Guard opened fire on the other truck, killing two Colombians and wounding four others. There was no immediate information on their conditions, and there were no reported casualties among the guardsmen involved.",
      "One Colombian and one Mexican man were found and detained unharmed at the scene, and the departments said officers found a pistol and several magazines commonly used for assault rifles at the scene.",
      "Colombians have sometimes been recruited as gunmen for Mexican drug cartels, which are also heavily involved in migrant smuggling. But the fact the survivor was turned over to immigration officials and that the Foreign Relations Department contacted the Colombian consulate suggests they were migrants.",
      "Cartel gunmen sometimes escort or kidnap migrants as they travel to the U.S. border. One possible scenario was that armed migrant smugglers may have been in one or both of the trucks, but that the migrants were basically unarmed bystanders.",
      "The defense department said the three National Guard officers who opened fire have been taken off duty while the incident is being investigated.",
      "Former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement; he created the militarized Guard and used the combined military forces as the country's main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. The Guard has since been placed under the control of the army.",
      "But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. Moreover, lopsided death tolls in such confrontations - in which all the deaths and injuries occur on one side - raise suspicions among activists whether there really was a confrontation.",
      "For example, the soldiers who opened fire in Chiapas - who have been detained pending charges - claimed they heard \"detonations\" prior to opening fire. There was no indication any weapons were found at the scene.",

      "Seoul \u2014\u00a0North Korea fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles early Tuesday, Seoul's military said. It was Pyongyang's second launch in days and it came just hours before Americans were set to vote for a new president.",
      "The nuclear-armed North last week test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). That was Kim Jong Un's first weapons test since he was accused by U.S. and Ukrainian officials of sending soldiers to help support Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "North Korea, which has denied the deployment, is under growing international pressure to withdraw its troops from Russia, with Seoul warning Tuesday that thousands of soldiers were being deployed to front-line areas, including the Russian region of Kursk, which Ukrainian troops pushed into months ago.",
      "Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the launch of \"several short-range ballistic missiles\" at around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday (5:30 p.m. Eastern, Monday) into waters east of the Korean peninsula. The missiles flew approximately 248 miles and Seoul's military said it had tracked the launch in real time while sharing information with Tokyo and Washington.",
      "\"In preparation for additional launches, our military has strengthened surveillance and alertness,\" it added. Seoul was set to get more U.S. help in monitoring the North's missile launches, meanwhile, with the State Department in Washington announcing Monday the approval of a new military aid package worth almost $5 billion.",
      "That package includes the potential sale of airborne early warning and control systems to South Korea, with the approval of four E-7 Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) aircraft, 10 jet engines, and other systems and support elements, at an estimated total cost of $4.92 billion.",
      "The early warning and control aircraft, known as Wedgetails, would enable South Korea to detect missiles and other threats more swiftly and from greater distances than ground-based radar systems.",
      "\"This proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's ability to meet current and future threats by providing increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airborne early warning and control capabilities,\" the State Department said. \"It will also increase the ROK Air Force's command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability with the United States.\"",
      "On Sunday, South Korea, Japan and the United States conducted a joint air drill involving a U.S. B-1B bomber, South Korean F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets, and Japanese F-2 jets, in response to the ICBM launch. Such joint drills infuriate Pyongyang, which views them as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "Pyongyang called its latest launch \"a direct response to the trilateral aerial exercises over the weekend,\" Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies told AFP. \"Given it was a salvo of short-range missiles, the North is indicating that it not only has long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S., but also short-range ones to target all bases in South Korea and Japan.\"",
      "Kim Yo Jong, sister of the country's leader and a key spokesperson, called the U.S.-South Korea-Japan exercises an \"action-based explanation of the most hostile and dangerous aggressive nature of the enemy toward our Republic.\"",
      "In a statement carried Tuesday by the official Korean Central News Agency, she said the drill was \"absolute proof of the validity and urgency of the line of building up the nuclear forces we have opted for and put into practice.\"",
      "Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en masse since Kim signed a mutual defense deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.",
      "\"More than 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, and we assess that a significant portion of them are deployed to front-line areas, including Kursk,\" Jeon Ha-gyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said Tuesday.",
      "Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.",
      "With its recent testing spate, \"Pyongyang is showing that its contribution of weapons and troops to Russia's war in Ukraine does not curtail its military activities closer to home,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. \"On the contrary, cooperation with Moscow appears to enable blatant violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\"",

    "story": [
      "Maumere, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people had died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores. The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 6,500 feet into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "Yosef said volcanic material was thrown up to 3.7 miles from the volcano's crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 2.4-mile radius of the crater. He said at least 10,000 people had been affected by the eruption in six villages.",
      "Some people fled to relatives' houses while the local government was readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",
      "The country's volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano's alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 4.3-mile radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island.",
      "\"Our nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,\" Palma said.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed tons of volcanic debris covering houses up to their rooftops in villages including Hokeng, where hot volcanic material set fire to buildings.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara \u00a0province known locally as the husband \u2014 \"Laki-laki\" means man \u2014   and wife mountains. Its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman.",
      "About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January's eruption and Monday's eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",
      "\"The eruptions that occurred since Friday were due to the accumulation of hidden energy,\" Wafid said.",
      "It's Indonesia's second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province's Mount Marapi, one of the country's most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. An eruption of Mount Marapi at the end of 2023 did claim at least 23 lives.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago nation that's home to some 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits on the \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.",

The protests, which saw women break taboos by removing their headscarves and on occasion even burning them, subsided in the face of a crackdown that left 551 protesters dead and thousands arrested.",
      "Many of those swept up in the crackdown claimed harsh treatment in custody, including some who said they were tortured and sexually assaulted. Iranian officials have denied all those allegations, calling them propaganda aimed at damaging the country's international reputation.",

    "story": [
      "Moldova's pro-European Union incumbent President Maia Sandu won a tense presidential runoff election Sunday, beating a rival backed by a pro-Russian party in what she called as a \"lesson in democracy.\"",
      "The election in the small ex-Soviet republic, which lies sandwiched between war-torn Ukraine and the European Union, was overshadowed by allegations of meddling by Moscow. The key vote took place just two weeks after a referendum saw Moldovans back their country's bid to join the EU by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Sandu won 54.94 percent of the vote compared to 45.06 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was supported by the pro-Russian Socialists party and whom Sandu fired as prosecutor general last year, according to near-complete results published by the country's election commission.",
      "\"Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books.... Freedom, truth, and justice have prevailed,\" Sandu declared. \u00a0 Her rival Stoianoglo, 57, urged people \"to remain calm, regardless of the figures,\" but the Socialists party that backed him was quick to release a statement Monday questioning the results and calling her \"illegitimate,\" without offering any specific evidence.",
      "\"Maia Sandu is an illegitimate president, recognized only by her sponsors and supporters abroad. The people of Moldova feel betrayed and robbed,\" the party claimed in a statement, decrying \"blocking of voters' access\" and other alleged irregularities in the vote, in which Sandu benefitted from strong support from the country's large diaspora.",
      "Biden says democracy won, \"Russia failed.\"",
      "In a statement issued Monday morning by the White House, President Biden said the Moldovan people \"went to the polls and voted in favor of President Sandu's vision for a secure, prosperous, and democratic Moldova.\"",
      "\"For months, Russia sought to undermine Moldova's democratic institutions and election processes. But Russia failed,\" Mr. Biden said. \"The Moldovan people have exercised their democratic right to choose their own future, and they have chosen to pursue a path aligned with Europe and democracies everywhere.\"",
      "EU chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her re-election victory and the country's \"European future,\" saying it took \"a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election.\"",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said democracy had \"triumphed over all interference and all manuevers.\"",
      "Sandu's victory was also applauded by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. His country, which Russia launched its ongoing full-scale invasion of almost three years ago, surrounds Moldova on three sides.",
      "\"Moldovans have made a clear choice,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"They chose a path toward economic growth and social stability.\"",
      "He vowed to strengthen Ukraine's ties with Moldova and noted that both countries had applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "\"Only true security and a peaceful, united Europe can guarantee each person and every family the confidence to face tomorrow with hope and certainty,\" he said.",
      "Accession negotiations for Moldova to join the EU formally opened in June. In the October 20 referendum, 50.35 percent of voters backed EU membership, with Sandu blaming \"foreign interference\" for the narrow result in the country of 2.6 million people.",
      "\"Attacks, provocations and attempts at destabilization\"",
      "Like in Georgia, another ex-Soviet country where the ruling party won a contested parliamentary election last weekend, Russia has been accused of seeking to sway voters. Moscow has denied the allegations.",
      "Police said after the EU referendum that they had uncovered a Russian vote-buying scheme that could have affected up to a quarter of the ballots, and Moldovan authorities reported \"attacks, provocations and attempts at destabilization\" on Sunday.",
      "Police said they were investigating Russia's alleged use of \"organized transportation\" to Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey so people living in Russia could vote at Moldovan missions in those countries.",
      "Cyberattacks and fake bomb threats also targeted out-of-country voting operations, authorities said.",
      "A deeply divided Moldova",
      "Turnout was higher than in the first round on October 20, when Sandu came out ahead with 42.5 percent and runner-up Stoianoglo got 26 percent.",
      "Casting his vote on Sunday, Stoianoglo said he had \"no relations with the Kremlin.\"",
      "While he's said he also favors joining the EU, he boycotted the referendum.",
      "Moldova is deeply polarized. A large diaspora and the capital mostly favor joining the EU, while rural areas and the pro-Russian separatist regions of Transnistria and Gagauzia are against it.",
      "Sandu lost in the territory of Moldova itself, election results showed, with her owing her victory to the diaspora.",
      "\"This is what tipped the election,\" said Florent Parmentier, a political scientist at Paris-based Sciences Po, noting Sandu's \"dependence on the outside.\"",
      "To maintain its pro-EU course, Moldova needs \"a lot of help\" given \"the hybrid war waged by Russia,\" according to Andrei Curararu, an analyst at the Chisinau-based WatchDog think tank.",
      "\"It will not succeed on its own,\" he said, earlier citing \"unprecedented pressure\" with more than $100 million estimated to have been spent on \"destabilization activities.\"",

      "The South Asasif Conservation Project, which led the dig, said in a news release that a green-blue glazed faience fertility figurine was also an \"important find.\"",
      "\"It is well-modeled and decorated with a variety of jewelry and lozenge markings on the legs and torso,\" the group's director, Dr. Elena Pischikova, said in a statement. \"Her cropped hair is painted black. The head is pierced with holes arranged in three sections. The holes were intended for the attachment of 'hair.' Almost 4,000 mud beads found next to the figurine constituted her original hair.\"",
      "The discovery came as Egypt has doubled efforts to attract more tourists, a significant source of foreign currency for the cash-strapped North African country. Tourism, which depends heavily on Egypt's rich Pharaonic artifacts, suffered a long downturn after the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising.",

      "Spanish Transport Minister \u00d3scar Puente said he was suspending all commuter trains in northeast Catalonia, a region with 8 million people, at the request of civil protection officials. Cell phones in Barcelona screeched with an alert for \"extreme and continued rainfall\" on the southern outskirts of the city. The alert urged people to avoid any normally dry gorges or canals.",
      "Puente said the rains had forced air traffic controllers to change the course of 15 flights operating at Barcelona's airport, located on the southern flank of the city, and the national airport operator later said a total of 50 flights at the hub were cancelled on Monday.",

      "A crowd of angry survivors hurled insults and mud at King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia as they visited the hard-hit Valencia suburb of Paiporta on Sunday.",
      "The crowd shouted \"Get out!\" and \"Killers\" among other insults as the monarch and other officials tried to talk to residents, prompting bodyguards to open umbrellas to protect the VIPs as the crowd of several dozen launched mud their way.",
      "Many Valencians have been infuriated by both the government's response to the disaster and the lack of warnings that such an inundation was coming. Some 3,000 residents in Valencia were still without electricity and internet access was limited on Monday. There have been sporadic reports of looting, too, with at least 20 people arrested from Sunday night into Monday.",
      "Spain's Mediterranean coast is buffeted by autumn storms that can cause flooding every year, but this year brought the most destructive flash floods in recent memory.",
      "Scientists link the scale of the disaster to\u00a0climate change.",
      "Human-caused climate change has doubled the likelihood of storms like last week's deluge in Valencia, according to a partial analysis issued on Oct. 31 by the World Weather Attribution group, which is made up of dozens of international scientists who study\u00a0global warming's role in extreme weather.",
      "Spain had suffered through drought conditions for almost two years, which made the flooding much worse because the parched ground was too hard to absorb the sudden downpour last week.",

So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre \u2014 the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal.

Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware.

      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",

      "With most of your life attached to these nine numbers, your Social Security number (SSN) is incredibly important to keep safe. That\u2019s why it is crucial to pay attention to signs that your SSN may have been compromised. While preventing the misuse of your SSN is paramount, there are action steps you can take if it does fall into the wrong hands.",

      "There are steps you can take if your Social Security number falls into the wrong hands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top signs someone might be using your Social Security number",
      "Are you concerned that your Social Security number may have gotten into the wrong hands? Check below to see if you are experiencing any of these signs:",
      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",
      "You can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",
      "Beware of new notices from the IRS or other governmental agencies. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top ways to keep your Social Security number safe",
      "Go to the official Social Security Administration website to create an account,\u00a0if you haven\u2019t already.",
      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",
      "Remember you (usually) only get one SSN in a lifetime, it is important to safeguard that data with your \"life.\"",
      "Removing your personal information from the internet, given the increasing privacy concerns about artificial intelligence, is essential. Data removal services can help protect your Social Security number by systematically erasing your details from websites, thus reducing the risk of identity theft.",

The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",

      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls. It even shows a fake call interface that looks just like the real Android dialer, complete with trusted contact info and names. This level of deception makes it really tough for victims to see what's happening.",

The developer of the malware has also added several new commands, including the ability to start livestreaming the device's screen, take screenshots, unlock the device if it\u2019s locked and temporarily turn off auto-lock.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.",

      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",

      "The new\u00a0iMac now comes with accessories that use USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. All USB-C ports also support the fastest Thunderbolt 4 standard, which means you can transfer large videos and other files faster. The display is still a 24-inch panel with 4.5K resolution, but Apple is now offering a \"nano-texture glass\" option for an extra $200, designed to reduce reflections and glare.",
      "There are a few other updates, too. The base RAM has doubled to 16GB from the previous model, with an option to go up to 32GB on the higher-end version. The new iMac also includes a 12MP webcam and introduces Apple Intelligence features, which are finally rolling out. These include AI-powered writing and editing tools and a redesigned Siri, now powered by ChatGPT.",
      "The\u00a0M4 iMac now comes in new colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, and purple. Silver remains an option too. It\u2019s available for preorder now, with shipping starting Nov. 8.

      "As the name suggests, the\u00a0Mac Mini\u00a0is a compact computer that can handle some serious workloads. First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They\u2019ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer\u2019s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that\u2019s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.",
      "The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple\u2019s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The\u00a0M4 Mini\u00a0comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.",
      "On the back, you\u2019ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.",
      "The starting price of the\u00a0Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn\u2019t something I say often about Apple products.",

The entry-level 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro still starts at $1,599, but Apple has upped the starting RAM to 16GB (a welcome boost from the previous 8GB).

But if you\u2019re just using an\u00a0iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash. The M4 Mac Mini, though, is a great value option with a competitive price and an extra $100 education discount. For those needing even more power, the new M4 MacBook Pros feature both M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, with base RAM now starting at 24GB on the Pro models and 16GB on the entry-level 14-inch version.",
      "What\u2019s also worth mentioning is Apple Intelligence, which Apple announced way back in May but is only now rolling out. I tried some of these features, and while I found them useful, they\u2019re not exactly earth-shattering.",

      "HOW TO SEND SPAM CALLS DIRECTLY TO VOICEMAIL ON YOUR PHONE",
      "How data brokers collect your information",
      "Data brokers collect, aggregate and sell your personal information, including your phone number, with the intent to sell it to interested parties. They can get your information in many ways, by accessing public information like government records or gathering data from loyalty card programs, surveys and social media. Mobile apps can also share your personal information with data brokers. Even your online browsing habits are valuable to data brokers. Your data profile can be sold to many different buyers, including targeted advertising and marketing companies, as well as\u00a0government agencies.",
      "How a data broker uses your information",
      "Some data brokers offer personal profiles directly to consumers, and you might be surprised by how much information they have about you. Have you ever tried searching for someone on a \"people search\" website? These sites let you enter a name and find out all sorts of information about that person. Try searching for yourself or someone you know. You might find out who used to live at your current address, how much money you make and who your relatives are.",
      "Where do people search sites get their information?",
      "People search sites get their information from public records like court documents and voter registration forms. They usually offer some basic information for free, but if you want more details, you\u2019ll have to sign up for a free trial. And when you do, they\u2019ll probably ask for even more information about you.",
      "The scary thing is that anyone with a computer can access this information, including identity thieves. With just a few key pieces of information, they can call your bank, reset your passcodes and take over your financial accounts.",
      "Even cyberstalkers and blackmailers can use people search sites to find out more about you. Sure, most sites make users promise not to use the information for illegal purposes, but there\u2019s no real way to enforce that. It\u2019s all based on the honor system.",
      "Taking control: removing your information from data brokers",
      "Don\u2019t worry though; there\u2019s something you can do about it. You can request that data brokers remove your information.\u00a0 But with hundreds of them in the U.S. alone, it can be a daunting task. That\u2019s where removal services come in.",
      "Invest in data removal services",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "The persistence of robocalls: why are they still a problem?",
      "While it\u2019s important to take steps to protect your personal information, such as removing it from data broker sites, there are still other threats to our privacy and security. For example, despite efforts to crack down on robocalls, scammers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection and continue their operations. Furthermore, as technology improves, robocallers are able to use more sophisticated methods, such as \"spoofing\" their phone numbers to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location or entity.",
      "Moreover, spam callers are becoming so sophisticated that they have started to add conversational speech to their scripts to further convince their unsuspecting victims to go along with their scams. For instance, the caller may stumble on their words, use \"umm\" a lot, and sometimes even use slang to signal to the listener that the caller is not a robot but an ordinary person, but beware! While some robocalls can range from harmless reminders, most are malicious scams, leaving many frustrated and vulnerable to fraud.

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 06:45:19 -0500",

      "JERUSALEM\u2014The devastating wars launched by Russia\u2019s authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin against Ukraine and the Hamas terrorist movement against Israel are raising uncomfortable questions\u00a0for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris about their alleged lack of resolve toward an Israeli\u00a0victory over the Islamic Republic of Iran-backed proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Fox News Digital turned to experts on the Mideast and Russia for their reflections on the different war strategies embraced by Biden and Harris with respect to Ukraine and Israel.",
      "\"The strategic behavior of the United States toward Ukraine and Israel differs substantially,\" David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and\u00a0Middle East\u00a0strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"There has never been any indication that the United States affords Russia any legitimacy to its reasons for invasion.\u00a0While a cease-fire in place may be sought, there is no indulgence of Russia\u2019s ostensible grievances or demands,\" Wurmser said, adding, \"In contrast, regarding the Palestinians, the October 7 attack was blasted as a horror and Israel\u2019s immediate defense was accepted, but the thrust of U.S. policy almost immediately and certainly with ever greater intensity was that a legitimate grievance underlies Palestinian claims and led to these events.\"",

      "While many Mideast experts see the effort to establish a\u00a0Palestinian state as a failed project, the Biden-Harris administration has embraced Palestinian demands and sought to push Israel to accept a two-state solution before the\u00a0Oct. 7 Hamas invasion and after Hamas massacred nearly 1,200 people in Israel.",
      "The language of Biden and Harris towards Ukraine and Israel also shows a disconnect. In September, after Russian missiles killed more than 50 during an attack on a training facility and hospital, Biden said, \"Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war.\u00a0The people of Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United States stands with them.\"",

      "Terminology that advances victory is largely shunned by Biden and Harris when discussing Israel\u2019s ground wars against Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Biden and Harris went as far as to threaten Israel with punitive measures if the Jewish state invaded the last stronghold of Hamas in the city of Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau called their bluff and defeated Hamas in Rafah, including the\u00a0elimination of its terrorist leader Yahya Sinwar last month.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Biden announced last month during a discussion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Victory Plan \"their resolve to\u00a0continue supporting Ukraine in its efforts to secure a just and lasting peace.\" In the same statement, the western world leaders stressed \"ending the war in Gaza,\" a message to Israel that it recoil from its anti-terrorism war.",

Ukraine has not experienced the same offensive war restrictions from Biden and Harris, argue experts.",
      "Wurmser noted that\u00a0\"Ukraine is not facing an incessant attempt from the first days of the Ukraine war of self-defense to stop the war in a way that allows its enemy to consolidate its gains and pocket a victory.\u00a0Only recently has the United States begun to indicate the preference for, but did not impose material pressure on yet, Ukraine to move toward a cease-fire.

After missiles and drones were sent by Iraqi militias in November 2023 into Israeli cities and ports, the United States similarly urged Israeli passivity but failed to provide Israel security.\"",

This incompetent approach \u2014 constantly pressuring Netanyahu to do a cease-fire, not letting him finish the job \u2014 is inviting escalation from Iran. Iran is emboldened, having witnessed that Biden-Harris don\u2019t have Israel\u2019s back. Iran has gotten so out of control that they\u2019ve targeted Netanyahu\u2019s home - think about that.

      "Despite these difficulties, Ofri\u2019s brigade has operated with minimal casualties. \"Eight fighters from my brigade have fallen since the fighting began,\" he says somberly. \"But we haven\u2019t lost any soldiers while securing the corridor, and that\u2019s the result of learning from others\u2019 experiences.\"",
      "The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has dominated media coverage since the conflict escalated, leading to significant criticism of Israel from the U.N. and various countries, including the U.S. Many organizations have highlighted the deteriorating situation for civilians, emphasizing that while they face hardships, the military also has a responsibility to minimize harm.",

      "\"They\u2019re living in tents under difficult conditions, but they lack neither food nor water,\" he says. \"Every day, we transfer about 30 trucks filled with food, water, tents and medicine. The other side, Hamas, doesn\u2019t account for the population; they exploit them. The terrorists we eliminate often wear civilian clothes. Some are disguised as women.\"",

      "\"All the convoys we needed to pass did pass, and then we saw Hamas setting up roadblocks, stopping and looting them,\" he says, elaborating on the complicated dynamics on the ground. \"Hamas targets specific trucks rather than looting indiscriminately. We observed them unloading supplies quickly, moving items into warehouses. We even saw armed Hamas vehicles leaving those locations, with guards at the entrances.\"",

Not a single shell or airstrike is executed without assessing potential collateral damage.\"",

      "\"The problem lies in Hamas's cynical use of the population,\" Ofri says. He blames the terror organization for the loss of so many civilian lives. \"We witnessed this during the recent Iranian attack. As soon as the Iranian assault began, on October 1, Hamas operatives attacked us. We were on the southern side of the corridor when they used short-range mortars to exploit the situation, pushing civilians toward our position. They forced people out of refugee camps, creating a dangerous environment as they told them to move closer to our forces,\" he says.",

      "In October, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader and the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attack, was killed by the IDF in Rafah, in southern Gaza. While many speculate that Sinwar\u2019s death may lead to a turning point in the conflict, Ofri remains dubious. \"In my view, he was just another terrorist who deserved to die. He\u2019s just another obstacle in the effort to release hostages. I understand we won\u2019t be able to free them through military means alone. However, I believe military pressure is the only strategy that has led to the first hostage deal.\"",
      "And it is because of the hostages that Israel must continue fighting, he says. \"There are 101 hostages left, many of whom are relatives of our soldiers. Oct. 7 affected us all. I lost friends that day as well,\" Ofri says. \"That\u2019s why we come together time and again, although it gets harder and harder. If you ask any soldier, they will tell you it\u2019s about the hostages.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democrats called for a full party reckoning on Wednesday, as they attempted to pick up the pieces of their shattered organization a day after Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss to former President Donald Trump.",
      "Interviews with more than a dozen campaign aides, strategists, elected officials and battleground state Democrats revealed a party consumed by fury, sorrow, finger-pointing and self-reflection. Many were granted anonymity so they could speak frankly about internal dynamics while emotions were still raw.",
      "They said they see a party that drifted far from its onetime identity as the protectors of those left behind, to represent the party elites. They questioned the campaign\u2019s decision to focus on reaching out to \u201csoft\u201d Republicans when they had their own issues with base voters.",
      "Some spoke of revamping the party\u2019s outlook on immigration, calling for stricter enforcement on the border. They saw the rising support for Trump in metro areas as a backlash from early policies during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that enabled migrants to flood into blue states, where they were often housed and financially supported even as working-class residents struggled to receive services.",
      "\u201cThis is a realignment. Our country has moved to the right. It\u2019s not center left. Our party needs to grapple with it and find its footing in that world,\u201d said Rep. Nikki Budzinski, an Illinois Democrat who won by double digits in a purple district after campaigning heavily on the economy. \u201cIt takes time. Finger-pointing is not worth it at all. This was a message. The voters were speaking to us. It would be to our detriment to not hear it.\u201d",
      "Of course, that wasn't a universal view, underscoring that there is a massive internal struggle looming.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., put out a statement blasting \"big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party.\"",
      "\"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\" he said Wednesday. \"First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they\u2019re right.\"",
      "Blame for Biden",
      "The finger-pointing was in full force Wednesday. Many Democrats blamed Biden for not dropping out sooner, while acknowledging that it was the party all along that enabled his ability to seek a second term, essentially clearing the primary for him.",
      "Harris, they said, inherited a campaign where the fundamental negatives of a nation on the wrong track were baked in. Some blamed the influence of the Obama-era consultants and strategists who play an outsize role in messaging and who, according to one longtime Democrat close to the Biden team, were \u201cstuck in 2009.\u201d",
      "One Harris ally said Democrats as a party will need to reckon with creating a \u201cmartyr\u201d out of Trump by impeaching him twice, bringing a number of state and federal prosecutions against him, and creating a Jan. 6 House Select Committee that spent weeks attacking him on prime-time television.",
      "\u201cPeople needed to pick who was going to go after him,\u201d the Harris ally said of prosecutors and Democrats. \u201cThere can\u2019t be eight cases against him. That\u2019s just not strategic because you\u2019re going to make him a martyr. And guess what? You made him a martyr. Everybody is suing him. Every attorney general is investigating him. Every Democrat that has the authority to investigate, is investigating Trump. We made ourselves look like a joke.\u201d",
      "Some of what went wrong can be traced to the dismantling of the coalition that ushered Biden into office in 2020, said a person close to Biden. The president claimed victory over Trump after beating out an expansive primary field that had moved too far to the left. But once Biden moved into the Oval Office, top aides pushed him toward policies that drifted from that moderate persona, like issuing wide-scale student debt relief, loosening restrictions at the border and pulling the permit to the Keystone Pipeline.",
      "Bring in the new guard",
      "Many Democrats were also calling for a clearing out of the old guard operatives who have run the last several campaigns.",
      "\u201cThe team that\u2019s there, it\u2019s time for them to retire. We need a whole different strategy,\u201d said one Democrat who was part of the re-election effort. \u201cThe day of Obama and his geniuses are over. They\u2019ve been left behind. They are out of touch with the American people. The Democratic Party is out of touch.\u201d",
      "Campaign aides and allies directed much of the angst at the campaign\u2019s chair, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, whom they complained ran a shop with the hand of an autocrat. According to three senior campaign officials, they saw her as loyal to Biden, never allowing Harris to truly make the break from him that she needed to win.",
      "O\u2019Malley Dillon, they said, siloed off information with just a tight circle of advisers, keeping other senior officials off email chains and updates. That sidelined many of the aides who knew Harris the longest \u2014 and the best, they said.",
      "It led to what some felt were grave mistakes, like Harris\u2019 remark on \"The View.\" In the interview, she was asked what she would do differently than Biden. Harris said she couldn\u2019t think of anything.",
      "The message was in direct conflict with what they thought was a crucial message that the vice president would be a change agent. Republicans jumped on the remark and ran it in ads.",
      "One of the officials said longtime Harris aides weren\u2019t included in prepping Harris before that interview.",
      "\"She makes that mistake on 'The View.' And she makes that mistake on 'The View' because they told her, \u2018be loyal,\u2019\u201d a senior campaign official said.",
      "A source with knowledge of campaign dynamics pushed back on the notion that O'Malley Dillon brushed aside any of Harris' team members, saying that throughout the contest, O\u2019Malley Dillon held daily meetings with Harris\u2019 two chiefs of staff, Lorraine Voles and Sheila Nix.",
      "One Harris aide called for more diversity among decision-makers, pointing to a far too-white leadership makeup of Harris\u2019 campaign and Biden\u2019s former campaign.\u00a0The campaign did have campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and former Rep. Cedric Richmond as a senior adviser, among others.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge gap in leadership of color, up and down the system that I think played to some of these blind spots,\u201d the person said. \u201cI just want to see more honesty and a little less whiteness ... I think that if we are able to kind of look within ourselves and see the talent that is already there, then there can be a new generation of leadership. But it\u2019s going to be tough. This feels like a decade loss. This is really bad, and we have to decide where we\u2019re going to go from here. We have to restructure the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The aide believed Democrats would still have lost if Biden was the candidate and that the party should have worked to ensure Biden didn\u2019t run for re-election.",
      "\u201cHow the hell did we not deal with this problem? He\u2019s 80 years old. He was supposed to be a one-termer. The man could barely speak and actually be coherent,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt was too late, and we knew we had a Biden problem this time last year. The party knew it and people truly were not honest about how out of touch he was and how his age was really playing with America.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, a Democratic lawmaker said, the party needs to reassess its leadership both in office and behind the scenes.",
      "\"There needs to be a real reckoning for the establishment about what went wrong,\" the lawmaker said. \"Longtime operatives and older leaders frankly need to step aside and allow for new ideas and a rebuilding of the Democratic Party with much more vision, substance and inspiration.\"",
      "Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to bow out \u2014 who said he doesn't regret it \u2014 said there is a mandate that Democrats work with Republicans right now. But he didn't have an answer for who in the party would be the next leader.",
      "\u201cTo be determined, I couldn\u2019t point to anyone,\" Welch said. \"It\u2019s a vacuum. Bring back James Carville.\u201d",
      "'Trying to please everybody'",
      "Several Democrats scoffed at any discussion about 2028, but governors like Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and JB Pritzker in Illinois are among those on the short list as potential next-generation White House contenders.",
      "Adam Jentleson, a former top Senate Democratic aide, said Trump\u2019s clear victory shows Democrats have a \u201cfundamental brand problem\u201d that likely no campaign could have solved in three months.",
      "The party has prioritized coalition management and keeping all of the myriad interest groups in its orbit happy instead of focusing first on winning elections, he said, which limits candidates\u2019 flexibility and pushes them to adopt unpopular positions, like the ones Harris embraced during her first presidential run in 2019 and spent most of her 2024 campaign trying to run away from.",
      "\u201cWe have fallen into this habit of trying to please everybody and then, only after we\u2019ve pleased everybody, take what\u2019s left and try to craft into it into a winning strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be a lot better about setting boundaries with the groups and taking the exigencies of politics seriously.\u201d",
      "If and when thermostatic backlash to Trump kicks in, he said Democrats need to be careful about channeling it into winning instead of pushing the boundaries of acceptable politics like during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cThe question is going to be what do you with that energy,\" he said. \"Do we do what we did last time and squander it on progressive edgelord politics, or do we capture it to actually fight back and change policy?\u201d",
      "Wade Randlett, a Harris supporter and longtime Democratic fundraiser from California, voiced optimism about the party\u2019s prospects down the road. Next up is the midterm election in 2026, when Trump\u2019s record will be an issue that\u2019s front and center for voters.",
      "\u201cTrump is going to do bat-s--- crazy stuff over the next two years and we\u2019re going to run a referendum campaign in the 2026 midterms about the bat-s--- crazy stuff.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we get to 2028,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe have to have a much better, clearer compelling case, with candidates who can make noncollege educated people feel the way Joe Biden did. Which is, he\u2019s middle-class Joe. He gets your life. And he thinks about your life. We\u2019ve gotta have someone who can do that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After having repeatedly depicted the presidential election as a spiritual clash between good and evil, leading figures in the movement to remake America as an explicitly Christian nation celebrated President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory as a fulfillment of God\u2019s divine will.",
      "Lance Wallnau, a celebrity evangelist who has spent decades calling on conservative Christians to occupy positions of power and influence over society, told followers on an election night livestream that Trump\u2019s victory had been prophesied years ago \u2014 a key step in God\u2019s plan to usher in a new era of Christian dominion around the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a different dialogue about spirituality happening in America,\u201d said Wallnau, who had worked to mobilize Trump voters in swing states. \u201cAnd with Donald Trump,\u201d he continued, God has \u201cgiven permission to take it right to the White House.\u201d",
      "White evangelical support for Trump has not wavered since he pledged in early 2016 while running for the GOP presidential nomination that if he were elected, \u201cChristianity will have power.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m there, you\u2019re going to have plenty of power, you don\u2019t need anybody else,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have somebody representing you very, very well. Remember that.\u201d",
      "Trump renewed that vow in the 2024 campaign, telling Christians they would be granted \u201cpower at a level that you\u2019ve never used before.\u201d He promised to crack down on acceptance of transgender people in schools and in society. And his campaign said it would create a task force focused on \u201cinvestigating all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America.\u201d",
      "While Trump, married three times and found liable for sexual abuse, might not seem an obvious fit to lead a religious movement, Wallnau and other evangelicals championed him as a flawed leader who had been anointed by God to save America from the demonic influence of Democrats. That belief took on new fervor in July after Trump survived the first of two assassination attempts.",
      "Trump embraced that narrative in his victory speech in Florida early Wednesday.",
      "\u201cMany people have told me that God spared my life for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\u201d",

      "The chain of events that propelled Trump back to the White House represented a \u201cdream scenario\u201d for Christians leaders who have sought to portray him as God\u2019s chosen vessel, said Matthew Taylor, a senior scholar at the nonprofit Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Maryland.",
      "Taylor, who has extensively researched the role Christian Trump loyalists played in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, said he believed the view of Trump as ordained by God could give him license to take extreme actions in office.",
      "As a candidate, Trump repeatedly spoke of seeking retribution against political opponents, including threats to jail officials who criticized him or worked to stop his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Some Christian leaders have echoed those calls. Other evangelicals hope Trump will support a national abortion ban and roll back the rights of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cHe has the capacity now to claim not only a democratic mandate, but a divine mandate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd there are legions of American Christians who are primed to embrace that narrative and to provide theological, moral and spiritual cover to whatever Trump decides to do.\u201d",

      "Sheets told his followers that Trump\u2019s victory would help usher in what he called a \u201cThird Great Awakening\u201d \u2014 what he and other believers say will be a global revival of fervent Christian faith around the world.",
      "\u201cThe reformation will take some time, but we will get there,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cAnd Trump is a necessary part of this reformation.\u201d",
      "Sheets and Wallnau did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

      "Trump\u2019s Hispanic vote percentage beat the previous record, set by George W. Bush's in 2004, when Bush won as much as 44% of the Hispanic vote. But in 2012, the vote swung heavily left, with 71% of Hispanics voting for President Barack Obama, followed by lower but still significant support for Hilary Clinton in 2016, at about 66%, and then joe Biden in 2020, at 65%.",
      "Harris underperformed Biden with Hispanic voters in every battleground state, with the exception of Wisconsin, according to NBC News exit polls. Her worst showings were in Michigan, where her 35% share dropped from Biden's 59%, and in Pennsylvania, where her share of 57% was well below Biden's 78%. She also underperformed Biden in Texas and Florida by double digits.",
      "From the beginning of the election to its final days, Latino voters in interviews and polls consistently named the economy, inflation or higher costs as their No. 1 issue and gave Trump the advantage on them.",
      "Pennsylvania voter Regino Cruz, 25, said Tuesday that he voted for Trump, believing the former president could improve the economy.",
      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s work. It\u2019s the economy. It\u2019s groceries,\u201d said Cruz, who's of Puerto Rican descent and was waiting to vote at the John B. Stetson Middle School\u00a0in Northern Philadelphia.",
      "Cruz said he wasn\u2019t fazed by recent comments a comedian made at a Trump rally calling\u00a0Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage, and added he didn\u2019t trust that Harris \u201ccan fix the economy.\u201d",
      "While inflation hit a 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, in September it had hit its lowest level since February 2021.",
      "'The numbers were there'",
      "In a September NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll, 34% of Latinos ranked the cost of living as the most important issue, followed by jobs and the economy at 20%. In that poll, the preference was Harris 54%, Trump 40%.",
      "Trump\u2019s gains among Latino voters included historic wins in places such as Starr County, Texas \u2014 a border county that had voted Democratic for 100 years \u2013 and in Miami-Dade, Florida, which went red for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Trump's showing also boosted outcomes for Latino Republicans. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas won Latino voters by 6 points, compared with 2018 when he lost Hispanic voters by 29 points, according to NBC News exit polls.",
      "In the battleground state of Pennsylvania, 4 in 10 Latino voters supported Trump, up from 3 in 10 in 2020.",
      "\u201cLatinos were telling us that the direction of the country was horrible. The numbers were there,\u201d said Florida International University political scientist Eduardo Gamarra. \u201cThe approval for the president was also down in the dumps. The approval for Harris was higher, but there was still an overwhelming sense that the country was going in the wrong direction. And the economy was the No. 1 issue, by far.\u201d",
      "Gamarra said the U.S. has the best economy in the world based on figures, \u201cbut what we don\u2019t realize is that people don\u2019t consume those figures. People go to the supermarket. They go to the gas pump. They\u2019re trying to buy a home. And if any group has been affected by the economy, it has been Hispanics.\u201d",
      "Under the Biden administration, Latinos made gains in health care coverage and homeownership and on labor participation and unemployment, they fared pretty equally compared to under Trump.",
      "But Latino voter dissatisfaction persisted despite better economic markers as the election progressed.",
      "Carlos Odio, co-founder of Equis Research, a Democrat-leaning polling and research company, said Latino voters who backed Trump liked his prioritization of the economy.",
      "\u201cThat was the message they got about Trump coming out of the pandemic, that this guy is going to prioritize the economy better than everyone else,\u201d Odio said. \u201cThey even told us in focus groups they didn\u2019t believe Trump was going to do any of the other stuff, whether it was banning abortion, repealing Obamacare or deporting Dreamers. They viewed that as political propaganda and ultimately viewed him as a businessman who was going to put the money first,\u201d Odio said.",
      "Odio warned against pinning the election outcome on the  Democratic drop in Latino support. Trump had \u201ceye-popping gains\u201d among Latinos in \u201cplaces like New York and New Jersey and Texas and Florida,\u201d he said. But Trump\u2019s victory came down to a broader erosion of support from voters.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a temptation to look at campaign tactics, but when you have a broad erosion, you have to zoom out and look at the crises of migration and inflation,\" Odio said. \"The twin crises of economy and migration have doomed incumbents across the world.\u201d",
      "A rightward shift on immigration \u2014 and a gender divide",
      "Latino voters, like other voter groups, shifted right on immigration, backing tougher enforcement against large groups of people arriving at the border that have strained resources in communities that have attempted to shelter them. In the September NBC News poll, 35% of Latinos polled said that immigration hurts more than it helps, the highest share of Latino voters to say so in about 20 years of surveys.",
      "Trump pledged to launch the largest deportation in American history on Day One of his administration. He has said he would use resources across federal agencies, including the National Guard to round up people in the county illegally.",
      "Artemio Muniz, chairman of the Federation of Hispanic Republicans, said he was pleased with the election outcome, but his elation was tempered because \u201cthe reality is there\u2019s work to do.\"",
      "\"Now my focus is to the immigration side. Now\u00a0we have a real battle on our hands, not with Trump,\" Muniz said, but \"we have to make sure ... hard-working Mexican immigrants do not get deported.\"",
      "Kalman Nunez, a 40-year-old barber in Milwaukee, said the election came down to jobs and immigration. Too many immigrants are crossing the border and taking jobs away from people here, he said.",
      "\u201cImmigration is out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is going to put an end to that.\u201d",
      "Hispanic men were key in propelling Trump to victory and a historic Latino vote share.",
      "Nationally,\u00a0NBC News exit polls estimate\u00a0that 54% of Latino men voted for Trump, while 44% supported Harris.",
      "Fernando Rivera, director of the Puerto Rico Research Hub at University of Central Florida, said that based on his research and focus groups, the economic message was particularly appealing to young men. \u201cAt the end of the day, Trump made a better argument,\" he said. \"And people bought that argument more than they bought the argument from Harris.\u201d",
      "While Trump often campaigned on banning abortion and border control, none of that mattered for Danny Martinez, 18, a first-time voter who considered himself a Democrat but voted for Trump. \u201cI care about one thing, and that\u2019s the money in my pocket,\u201d he said.",
      "But among Latinas, 61% voted for Harris, and a much lower share (37%) supported Trump.",
      "In Philadelphia, Yahaira Rodr\u00edguez, 33, said she was voting for Harris on Tuesday, because \u201cI\u2019m all about morality, and Trump doesn\u2019t stand for anything that I stand for.\u201d",
      "Christianea Valentine, a 33-year-old mother of three, said her most important issue in voting for Harris was \u201cwomen\u2019s rights, especially as I\u2019m a woman and I have a daughter, that was a big thing for me.\u201d",
      "In the NBC News September poll, 4% of Latino voters named abortion as their most important issue, which Harris made central to her campaign.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump campaign's promise of better economic times and tougher border policies resonated most among one of the nation's fastest-growing voter groups.",
      "\"Our movement is bigger, stronger, and more diverse than ever \u2014 with real, working-class Americans, including Hispanics,\u201d\u00a0said Vianca Rodriguez, Trump campaign deputy director of Hispanic communications."

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is making contingency plans for a possible surge in border crossings ahead of a Trump presidency, as more would-be immigrants say they are concerned President-elect Donald Trump will shut down the border, according to two U.S. officials and exchanges between immigrants on WhatsApp groups.",
      "On Monday afternoon, nearly 36 hours before Trump declared victory, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas held a virtual meeting with his top advisers and the heads of Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in which the participants raised concerns about what a possible Trump victory would do to border security.",
      "The questions posed to the group were not unusual, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the call: How was the Department of Homeland Security operationally prepared to deal with a potential spike in immigration? Was there enough bed space in ICE detention to hold immigrants before deporting them? Would the agencies be able to continue placing migrants who do not qualify for asylum on a rapid path toward removal, or would numbers overwhelm the system and force agents to release migrants into the U.S. with court dates set years into the future?",
      "The officials reiterated that the DHS has not yet seen a surge in migrants heading to the U.S. But the concern was raised: If Donald Trump were to be elected, they would predict an increase in migrants trying to enter the country at the last minute, and CBP and ICE needed to be prepared.",
      "A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said \"migrants should not believe the lies of smugglers.\"",
      "\"The fact remains: the United States continues to enforce immigration law, and migrants should use safe, lawful, and orderly pathways to come to the United States,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "During the campaign, Trump vowed to deport millions of undocumented migrants should he win election.",
      "As Tuesday night brought news of a decisive victory for Trump, immigrants began to talk on WhatsApp, a common channel for smugglers to advertise their services to people in Central and South America looking to come to the U.S. A common theme emerged among multiple users: The time to come to the U.S. is now.",
      "\u201cAfter the 21 of January he\u2019ll close the borders with extreme security,\u201d said one person on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, referring to the day after Trump takes office.",
      "\u201cUntil the 10th\u00a0of January there is a chance,\u201d said another, erroneously claiming Jan. 10 was the date Trump would take office, instead of Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cMy sister is still in Mexico. I couldn\u2019t sleep thinking of her,\u201d another WhatsApp user worried.",
      "\u201cHe takes power on the 21 of January. He can\u2019t make any decree yet,\u201d said a messenger. Another replied: \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of [time] left. He has the decrees already in his mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have until January to enter,\u201d one person declared.",
      "The operator of a shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, where migrants wait before they enter the U.S., said he expects smugglers, known as coyotes, to pressure immigrants to start crossing now.",
      "\u201cOf course, the coyotes will arrive, they are going to say that they need to get in before Donald Trump arrives,\u201d said Gustavo Banda, operator of Templo Embajadores de Jesus, which is housing about 1,400 migrants.",
      "Banda said there is a feeling of uncertainty among migrants at his shelter, but he tries to keep them calm. \u201cNo one knows what is going to happen,\u201d Banda said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to talk to them, that for the moment, absolutely nothing changes.\u201d",
      "In another part of Mexico near the U.S. border, Francisco Loureiro, a shelter operator in Nogales, said he talked to migrants yesterday about the election outcome and their concerns.",
      "\u201cWe have migrants who are worried, who don\u2019t know what is going to happen now with their [CBP ONE] appointment,\u201d Loureiro, who runs the San Juan Bosco shelter in town, said, referring to the app that migrants can use to apply for asylum without entering the U.S.",
      "The shelter operator said that he\u2019s aware of a recent caravan of migrants who left the Mexican state of Chiapas, an area that sits along the border of Guatemala, and have made their way to the northern part of Mexico. And while caravans like these are nothing new, he said, he\u2019s ready for more migrants to potentially head to the Nogales area before Trump takes office.",

    "story": [
      "Just five minutes of vigorous exercise a day might help lower blood pressure, a new study suggests.",
      "An analysis of data from nearly 15,000 people revealed that running, biking, climbing stairs or brisk walking for just those few minutes can have a positive effect on blood pressure. Increasing activity up to 20 minutes can reduce the risk of heart disease by a significant amount, according to the report published Wednesday in Circulation.",
      "\u201cExercise is the most important thing favorably associated with blood pressure,\u201d Mark Hamer, a professor in sport and exercise medicine at University College London, said in a Zoom interview.",
      "People with high blood pressure have a higher risk for heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the U.S. In 2022, high blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of 685,875 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Nearly half of all Americans have high blood pressure, which is defined as a systolic blood pressure (the upper number) of greater than 130 or a diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) greater than 80.",
      "Adults should get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, most guidelines recommend.",
      "To look at how much of an effect exercise might have on blood pressure, Hamer and his colleagues combined data from six earlier studies that required participants to wear movement trackers on their thighs 24-hours a day.",
      "The 14,761 participants had an average age of 54 and were almost evenly divided between male and female (53% women).",
      "On average, participants spent seven hours a day sleeping, 10 hours in sedentary behaviors such as sitting, three hours standing, one hour slow-walking, one hour fast-walking and 16 minutes in vigorous exercise.",
      "The researchers found that replacing any less active behavior with five minutes of exercise could lower systolic blood pressure by 0.68 points and diastolic blood pressure by 0.54 points. When exercise time was 15 minutes longer, the reduction was bigger.",
      "An estimated two point improvement in systolic blood pressure was observed when 20 minutes of vigorous exercise replaced, for example, 21 minutes of sedentary time or\u00a0 26 minutes of slow-walking. Previous research found that a decrease of two points in systolic blood pressure could result in a 7% to 10% reduction in heart disease and stroke death, the researchers note.",
      "The new study \u201cadds more evidence supporting the idea that even a small amount of movement can have a meaningful effect on cardiovascular health,\u201d said Dr. Arun Manmadhan, an assistant professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.",
      "The idea of vigorous exercise can be daunting to people who are out of condition, Manmadhan said. \u201cThis study tells us that a starting point of five to 10 minutes a day can help,\u201d he added. \u201cThe blood pressure improvement from five minutes alone is not that meaningful \u2014 it\u2019s less than one point. But you can ramp up from that to the point where there is a clinical improvement to your cardiovascular risk profile.\u201d",
      "There are lots of barriers to getting started, said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the research. \u201cSome people feel like they are too busy,\u201d he added. \u201cPapers like this point out that it doesn\u2019t have to take up a huge amount of time. Depending on what you\u2019re doing you may need little or no equipment.\u201d",
      "The chief takeaway from this study is that every bit of exercise is important, said Dr. Sean P. Heffron, an assistant professor of medicine and director of cardiovascular fitness and nutrition at New York University Langone Medical Health. Heffron was not part of the new study.",
      "\u201cI try to encourage people to do things they enjoy, such as hiking,\u201d Heffron said, adding that the new findings might help people who are out of condition to start working out.",
      "Having a step tracker, such as the ones often included in smart phones, can help people self-monitor how much exercise they are getting, said Dr. Evan Brittain a professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.",
      "\u201cWe used to think if you didn\u2019t go for 20 or 30 minutes at a time, it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Brittain, who was not part of the research. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of data now showing that short bursts of activity work.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome rewards fans for passion \u2014 and boasts more technology (and toilets) than anywhere else.",
    "story": [
      "INGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Inside what may be the world\u2019s most technologically advanced stadium, one of the clearest indications that things are different is heard in its restrooms.",
      "Unlike many professional sports stadiums that pipe audio of the game broadcast into restroom speakers, Intuit Dome, the brand-new home of the Los Angeles Clippers, plays a different soundtrack for fans using its more than 1,100 touchless toilets and urinals: pop music.",
      "The choice was intentional. Although Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief executive who has owned the Clippers since 2014, designed the $2 billion arena to include bells and whistles, he primarily wanted a place for exuberantly passionate fans of basketball, like him. To create that, incentives intended to get fans \u201cback to their damn seats,\u201d as Ballmer once said, were baked into the design \u2014 including, but not limited to, a lack of restroom play-by-play.",
      "The result is an arena with ambitions as lofty as the franchise\u2019s dreams of winning a first NBA championship. Intuit Dome wants to rewire fans\u2019 habits and change the way they\u2019re used to rooting for the home team.",
      "\u201cIt feels kind of like an NBA Disneyland, versus [Crypto.com Arena, the Clippers\u2019 former home, shared with the Los Angeles Lakers] where it\u2019s a multiteam, multisport arena,\u201d said Oscar Burrows-Rangel, a longtime Clippers fan. \u201cThis is dedicated to basketball, and everywhere you look, you know you\u2019re at a basketball game. You know you\u2019re at a basketball arena. You know you\u2019re here for the game.\u201d",
      "Across professional sports, the game can feel secondary as teams court the spending of more casual fans. Wide-open concourses with views of the court encourage wandering. When the Phoenix Suns finished their $240 million home arena renovation in 2021, they added what has been described as the largest sports bar in Arizona, a 60-foot-long bar in one corner of the concourse, overlooking the court. State Farm Arena, in Atlanta, houses a bar accessible to its highest-paying customers that sits on the arena\u2019s literal hardwood floor, only feet from the benches.",
      "Ballmer included big, show-stopping attractions, too, led by a halo scoreboard with the equivalent of an acre\u2019s worth of LED lighting. An 80,000-foot plaza outside the main gate includes a court for pickup games. Just as unique, however, are the design choices that earn less attention but also affect the customer experience, said longtime Clippers fans who attended the Oct. 23 regular-season opener, against Phoenix.",
      "When the game begins, even the priciest bunker suites on the court level at Intuit Dome don\u2019t feature big-screen televisions \u2014 a nudge to get fans into the suites\u2019 seats if they want to watch James Harden run pick-and-rolls with Ivica Zubac. To reduce the time fans want to spend out of their seats, Ballmer pushed to make them more comfortable to sit in, by increasing the leg room, and closer to the action, with a fan in the 20th row about 45 feet closer to the court than at the Clippers\u2019 previous arena, according to the team.",
      "Each of the 17,927 seats includes a microphone to determine which fans are cheering the loudest \u2014 a measure that can earn fans rewards later \u2014 and a four-button controller. Inspired by Microsoft\u2019s Xbox, the directional controller is embedded into the armrest to allow fans to take part in games on the scoreboard during breaks in play. According to a team spokesman, just over 80% of the armrest controls had been used after two preseason games and the Oct. 23 regular-season opener, against Phoenix.",
      "Ballmer has also acknowledged being obsessive over cutting down lines. He has said the number of toilets and urinals is three times the number in the average NBA arena. Concession stands incorporate facial recognition to allow fans who have linked their wallets to the arena\u2019s app to walk in and out, bypassing registers.",
      "\u201cYou kind of know that you can leave and come back without having to miss too much of the game,\u201d Burrows-Rangel said.",
      "To sit in \u201cThe Wall,\u201d a 51-row section rising at a steep pitch from close to the opposing team\u2019s bench to the stadium\u2019s uppermost row, fans must pass a certification test to prove they are Clippers fans. Within The Wall is a 13-row supporters\u2019 section directly behind the basket with European soccer-inspired elevated handrails to encourage fans who want to stand. Erica Okeith, who has watched the team since it played in the Los Angeles Sports Arena more than a quarter-century ago, was among the fans who watched the first regular-season game against Phoenix from the supporters\u2019 section.",
      "She had to agree to terms that reward rabid fandom. The first 175 fans with passes to the section who arrive at least an hour early get complimentary parking. Also, the earliest arrivals earn seats closest to the court. But those who no-show on their supporters\u2019 section reservations more than five times can have their passes canceled.",
      "\u201cI am the type of fan that likes to stand up at games, anyway, and in other places in the arena typically other fans don\u2019t like that,\u201d Okeith said. \u201cFor me to be able to know I can stand up and no one\u2019s going to tell me to sit down or have an issue with it is a benefit for me.\u201d",
      "Suns star Kevin Durant complimented the Wall design as \u201cinsane\u201d after having played in the arena\u2019s first regular-season game, and Okeith noticed Clippers players, too, acknowledging fans in the section. Standing throughout the game wasn\u2019t mandatory, but it was the intention, she said. Okeith noticed fans in other sections following the lead of the supporters\u2019 section\u2019s chants and movements and believes it will catch on.",
      "In the upper rows of The Wall sat Jason Holzgang, 24, who has attended Clippers games since 2005. When details about The Wall were released years earlier, Holzgang was skeptical about how much of a home-court advantage it would provide. But in his first game, he already felt his usual in-game habits changing.",
      "\u201cWith me in The Wall, I\u2019m like, \u2018I got to keep screaming, I got to keep screaming,\u2019 when usually I would kind of chill,\u201d Holzgang said.",
      "Kinks were still being smoothed out in the arena\u2019s opening week of the regular season. Some customers reported some difficulty with the frictionless payment system at the grab-and-go concession stands, unable to walk out at first as expected. Some who had linked their wallets and ages in the app and expected to be able to purchase alcohol using only its \u201cGameFace ID\u201d facial recognition software said they were told they needed their physical identification. After it sold out of some merchandise and apparel items quickly, the team was trying to improve its real-time inventory tracking, the team spokesman said. Some fans saw improvements after the opening game, but others were vocal on social media about issues that had persisted in how the app and the touchless checkouts worked.",
      "One of the most significant elements about watching a Clippers game that Ballmer aims to change involves what is heard, and what isn\u2019t, in other parts of the building. For years at Crypto.com Arena, large fan bases supporting opposing teams, such as Golden State, New York or Boston, would often drown out the noise created by home fans. It was why, for Daniel Albitres, one of the first signs that things might be different came when word spread throughout The Wall on Oct. 23 that ushers had removed a fan who had tried to sneak in a Suns jersey for violating the policy against wearing gear of the opposing team in the supporters\u2019 section.",
      "Albitres looked around him and saw only Clippers gear. That was a first.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a spot where you know you\u2019re going to have your fans,\u201d Albitres said. \u201cFor the first time, I saw someone with another jersey get kicked out. It was probably the highlight of my day.\""

    "summary": "A jury on Tuesday found an Alabama man not guilty of killing an 11-year New Hampshire girl more than 35 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "BOSTON \u2014 A jury on Tuesday found an Alabama man not guilty of killing an 11-year New Hampshire girl more than 35 years ago.",
      "A factor in the case was whether the jury believed DNA found under Melissa Ann Tremblay\u2019s fingernails was from Marvin \u201cSkip\u201d McClendon Jr. After telling a judge Monday they were deadlocked, the jury returned Tuesday and found McClendon not guilty on the sixth day of deliberations.",
      "\u201cMr. McClendon was greatly relieved by the verdict,\u201d McClendon\u2019s lawyer, Henry Fasoldt, told The Associated Press, adding that he would return home to Alabama after being held for two-and-a-half years. \u201cWe appreciate the jury\u2019s careful and thoughtful deliberations.\u201d",
      "Essex County District Attorney Paul F. Tucker said he \u201cdisappointed with the verdict\u201d but praised the efforts of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in the case.",
      "\u201cI recognize the work and dedication of the jury during their long deliberations in this case,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cMy thoughts are with the family of Melissa Ann Tremblay, who have suffered greatly due to the crime that took her life.\u201d",
      "Last year, a judge declared a mistrial in McClendon\u2019s prosecution after a jury deadlock. The body of the Salem, New Hampshire, girl was found in a Lawrence, Massachusetts, trainyard on Sept. 12, 1988, a day after she was reported missing.",
      "The victim had accompanied her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend to a Lawrence social club not far from the railyard and went outside to play while the adults stayed inside, authorities said last year. She was reported missing later that night.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother, Janet Tremblay, died in 2015 at age 70, according to her obituary. But surviving relatives have been attending court to observe the latest trial.",
      "The family, in statement, said they respected the process but believe McClendon was still guilty of murder based on the DNA results.",
      "\u201cThe DNA was Missy\u2019s way of trying to tell us who killed her,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAs she was being attacked she fought for her life and got his DNA under her fingernails so that we would be able to get a match and make the person killing her pay for his crime. While he was found not guilty in a court of law, he will ultimately pay for his crime on the final Judgement day before God.\u201d",
      "After initially ruling out several suspects, including two drug addicts, early on, authorities turned their attention to McClendon.",
      "He was arrested at his Alabama home in 2022 based in part on DNA evidence.",
      "Essex County Assistant District Attorney Jessica Strasnick told the jury that comments McClendon made during his arrest showed he knew details of the crime and that he was \u201cfixated on the fact that she was beaten, ladies and gentlemen, because he knew that she wasn\u2019t just stabbed that day, that was she was beaten.\u201d",
      "A left-handed person like McClendon stabbed Tremblay, Strasnick said. She told jurors that the carpenter and former Massachusetts corrections officer was familiar with Lawrence, having frequented bars and strip clubs in the city. He also lived less than 20 miles away at the time of the killing.",
      "Strasnick told the jury that the DNA evidence taken from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails excludes 99.8% of the male population.",
      "But Fasoldt said there was no proof the DNA came from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails or was from McClendon.",
      "Fasoldt also said evidence shows that a right-handed person, rather than a left-handed person, could have stabbed Tremblay.",
      "He also argued that McClendon had \u201cno meaningful connection\u201d to Lawrence \u2014 other than that he lived 16 miles away in Chelmsford. He moved to Alabama in 2002 to a plot of land his family owned."

      "\"It was really upsetting, because I felt like I just didn\u2019t have any control over how people saw me or who I was,\" she said.",
      "She blamed the negative perception of her on the internet and the unexpected level of publicity it led to as reasons she decided to stop competing.",
      "\"I think the level of scrutiny that\u2019s going to be there and the people who will be filming it and it\u2019ll go online, it\u2019s just not going to mean the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the same experience because of everything that\u2019s at stake.\"",
      "Asked specifically whether she'd ever compete at the Olympics again, she immediately answered, \"No.\"",
      "\"I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems a really difficult thing for me to do now,\" she said.",
      "While her competitive days may be behind her, Gunn seems to have found another way to keep her love for breaking alive.",
      "Last week, she launched the #RaygunChallenge, a contest challenging breakdancers to show off their moves.",
      "\"I\u2019ve heard some of you think you can do better than me,\" Gunn said in a\u00a0joint Instagram post\u00a0with Finder Australia. \"Really? Let\u2019s find out, shall we?\"",
      "Contestants must use the \"Finder Beat\" and upload their videos to TikTok or Instagram with the hashtag #RaygunChallenge and Finder Australia's Instagram account tagged to enter.",
      "The best solo dancer will win $5,000 Australian, and the best group dance will earn $10,000 Australian. The submission deadline is 11:59 p.m. AET (8 a.m. ET) Monday. Finalists will be announced on Nov. 14, and fan voting will take place for the following week before winners are announced at 12 p.m. AET Nov. 22."

The substance is rubbed on every baseball before every major league game.\u00a0Called Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud, it comes from a single source: a secret spot along the banks of a tributary of the Delaware River. Jim Bintliff, a retired New Jersey printing press operator, collects the mud about once a month from his grandfather\u2019s old fishing hole.

The latter studs the surface of a ball like barnacles to enhance friction, yet the material still spreads thin and even, like toothpaste.\u00a0\u201cThe more you push on it, the more it flows,\u201d Jerolmack said.",
      "The authors concluded that any attempt to create a synthetic substance to replace the mud \u2014 something Major League Baseball has explored \u2014 would be foolish.",
      "\u201cIt is a very special combination of ingredients that nature makes that make it work,\u201d Jerolmack said.",
      "The mud\u2019s origin story is rooted in tragedy.",
      "In a game in August 1920, New York Yankees pitcher Carl Mays fired a ball toward Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman and hit him in the head. The ball struck Chapman\u2019s skull, killing him.",
      "The death raised concerns about wild pitches and the risk of fresh, shiny baseballs slipping from pitchers\u2019 hands. So in 1929, the president of the National League required umpires to start soiling balls for better grip, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "But finding the right substance proved tough.",
      "\u201cThey tried to use infield dirt. That scratched the leather too much. They tried using shoe polish and tobacco spit; those things darkened the ball too much,\u201d Bintliff said.",
      "Finally, in 1938, Lena Blackburne, a third-base coach for the Philadelphia Athletics, remembered a fine filtered mud from his childhood in New Jersey. He went back to the source, collected it and began applying it.",
      "The mud was so popular that Blackburne created a business of processing and selling it. Eventually, he passed the company to a childhood friend with whom he used to fish and swim, whose grandson, Bintliff, now runs the company with his wife.\u00a0Since 2022, MLB has mandated that at least 156 balls get prepared for every game, each getting at least a 30-second rub with the mud within a three-hour period.",
      "Bintliff said MLB purchases tubs of mud for every team at $100 each \u2014 two for the regular season and more for spring training. Some clubs, like the World Series-winning Dodgers, purchase additional containers for their farm systems, he added.",
      "\u201cThis mud works as a superfine abrasive and takes the gloss coating off without doing any type of damage to the leather or laces,\u201d Bintliff said.",
      "He collects the mud in 5-gallon buckets \u2014\u00a0usually around 10 to 20 buckets per visit to the riverbank \u2014 then processes it in his garage by draining the river water, removing twigs and stone and adding tap water. The process yields a rough average of 150 pounds of product.",
      "Are any special ingredients added?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the proprietary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The scientists who studied the mud aren\u2019t baseball die-hards, but they got interested after doing an informal analysis of the substance five years ago. After that, two students at Jerolmack\u2019s lab set off to prove whether or not the mud worked. They developed three key tests.",
      "First, they analyzed the mud\u2019s adherence, or stickiness, by using an atomic force microscope, which measures the mud\u2019s resisting force as an instrument pulls away from it. Then, to understand how well the mud flowed, the researchers placed some on a machine called a rheometer that spun the sample and measured its viscosity.The third test estimated the friction between human skin and a baseball; it involved constructing a \u201cfinger\u201d out of synthetic rubber, with a drop of whale oil substituting for the oils secreted by human skin. The \u201cfinger\u201d was pressed to strips of leather baseballs then spun on the rheometer.",
      "The properties those tests revealed are rare and sought after in cosmetics and other fields, according to Emanuela Del Gado, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Soft Matter Synthesis and Metrology.\u201cIn industry, people spend quite some time to adjust the formulation to obtain that type of property,\u201d said Del Gado, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cSimple materials to us, can be extremely complex, and they can teach us a lot,\u201d she added, noting that the mud was shaped by currents, rainfall and long cycles of seasonal environmental changes.",
      "These days, Bintliff counts among his clients college coaches, Little League umpires and National Football League teams. He plans to pass the business to one of his children.",
      "So far, the mud has survived new technology vying to replace it.",
      "In 2016, MLB tested balls coated with a proprietary chemical, and last year, Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league was working with Dow Chemical to develop a \u201ctacky ball\u201d that would stay \u201cpure white.\u201d But that project has not closed in on a solution that could replace the mud, an MLB source said.",
      "The study authors recommended against abandoning the mud, given their new evidence supporting what ballplayers intuited more than 80 years ago: \u201cThis stuff works,\u201d Jerolmack said."

      "During the part of the show dedicated to her fourth album \u201cRed,\u201d Swift walks down the catwalk while singing \u201c22\u201d and meets one attendee standing at the edge of the stage. Swift crouches down each night and takes off her black fedora to give to the fan.",

      "Recently, Collins Dictionary announced\u00a0\u201cbrat\u201d as its 2024 word of the year, defining it as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",

      "The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of\u00a0the recently raided and barely functioning\u00a0Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service.\u00a0Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza\u00a0early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in the north after saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel.",
      "The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month.

    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, a long-rumored move that was announced on Election Day in the U.S. Netanyahu and Gallant had repeatedly clashed over the conduct of the war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Protests erupted in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in response to the decision, with critics accusing Netanyahu of prioritizing his own political survival over Israel's best interests, while families of those held hostage in Gaza expressed deep concern over the impact Gallant's firing could have on efforts to secure the release of their loved ones.",
      "Gallant will be replaced by Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who thanked Netanyahu in a social media post for trusting him with the role. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu opponent, will become foreign minister and cement support for the fragile ruling coalition keeping the embattled Israeli leader in power.",
      "\u201cIn the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cUnfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the minister of defense.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu added that there were significant \u201cgaps\u201d between what the Cabinet had decided and what he termed \u201cthe campaign.\u201d",
      "He added that most members of the government and the Cabinet shared a \u201ccrisis of trust\u201d with Gallant.",
      "Gallant, in response Tuesday, said, \u201cThe security of the State of Israel always was, and will always remain, my life\u2019s mission.\u201d",
      "In a later address, he said Netanyahu had informed him of the decision earlier that evening.",
      "He said he was fired over discord on three key issues, including his support for Israel making \"painful compromises\" in order to ensure the release of hostages who remain held in Gaza, as well as his calls for a commission of inquiry to investigate Israel's failures on Oct. 7, 2023, and his support for legislation that would remove exemptions allowing ultra-Orthodox Jewish men to avoid military conscription.",
      "Signs of strains in the Gallant-Netanyahu relationship appeared over the last months. Gallant was scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in Washington in early October \u2014 a trip Gallant initiated \u2014 but it was postponed at Netanyahu\u2019s request.",
      "Gallant, who has spent decades in the military,\u00a0has been critical of Netanyahu\u2019s approach to the conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "His firing drew immediate criticism from opposition leader Benny Gantz, who said it was \u201cpolitics at the expense of national security.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the decision as an \"act of madness\" and accused Netanyahu of \"selling Israel's security and the IDF fighters for a disgraceful political survival.\"",
      "In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed its \"deep concern\" about the decision and about how it would affect \"the fate of 101 hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for nearly 400 days.\"",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X: \"The last thing the State of Israel needs right now is an upheaval and a rupture in the middle of the war.\"",
      "Netanyahu's decision was welcomed by his ultranationalist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who congratulated him on the move.",
      "\"With Gallant ... it is not possible to achieve absolute victory,\" Ben-Gvir wrote on X.",
      "In a nationally televised statement in May, Gallant challenged Netanyahu over his refusal to discuss a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said that would force Israel to have to rule over the Palestinian enclave again.",
      "\u201cWe must make tough decisions for the future of our country, favoring national priorities above all other possible considerations, even with the possibility of personal or political costs,\u201d Gallant said over the summer.",
      "In the United States, a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Gallant has been an important partner on Israel's defense.",
      "\u201cAs close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel\u2019s next Minister of Defense,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A U.S. official called Gallant's firing a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe surprising decision to fire Defense Minister Gallant is concerning, especially in the middle of two wars and as Israel prepares to defend against a potential attack from Iran,\" the official said. \"We have real questions about the reasons for Gallant\u2019s firing and about what is driving the decision.\u201d",
      "Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Gallant had been a \"trusted partner as Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense.\"",
      "\"America\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security remains ironclad and the U.S. Department of Defense will continue to work closely with Israel\u2019s next Minister of Defense,\" he said.",
      "Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative political party, said Gallant's firing was \"evidence of a deep internal rift in the Israeli system as a result of the failure of the Israeli aggression to achieve its goals.\"",
      "In the days after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people, Gallant announced a \"complete siege\" of Gaza.",
      "\"No electricity, no food, no water, no gas \u2014 it's all closed,\" Gallant said at the time, adding that his military was fighting against \"human animals\" in Gaza, where local officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed.",
      "Netanyahu fired Gallant in March 2023, after he publicly disagreed with the government and pushed to stop a controversial plan to overhaul the judicial system. The move prompted mass protests and led Netanyahu to reverse the decision."

    "summary": "A disturbance in the Caribbean strengthened Monday afternoon into Tropical Storm Rafael, which is forecast to become a hurricane Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Rafael slipped by western Jamaica en route to the Cayman Islands and was expected to strengthen into a hurricane Tuesday evening, federal forecasters said.",
      "Rafael, which formed Sunday as Potential Tropical Cyclone 18, is about 45 to 50 miles southeast of the Cayman Islands and was producing winds of 70 mph, National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a video update Tuesday.",
      "\"The center will be moving over those islands this evening, likely as a hurricane,\" he said.",
      "Hurricane status requires sustained winds of at least 74 mph, which denote the start of Category 1 strength; Category 2 is defined by damaging, sustained winds of at least 96 mph, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The storm was moving northwest at 15 mph, the hurricane center said in its 4 p.m. ET Tuesday update.",
      "Forecasters said Rafael was \u201cgetting better organized\u201d as its center passed Jamaica. It\u2019s expected to undergo \u201csteady to rapid intensification\u201d over the next 24 to 36 hours, and it could reach Category 2 hurricane strength just before it reaches Cuba late Wednesday morning or early Wednesday afternoon, Brennan said.",
      "Rafael is the 17th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, and it will be the 11th hurricane if it strengthens further, as expected. The season lasts until Nov. 30, though peak activity is usually around Sept. 10.",
      "The storm system is expected to approach the U.S. later in the week, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued Monday afternoon for the lower and middle Florida Keys and for the Dry Tortugas, which was upgraded Tuesday morning to a tropical storm warning.",
      "Brennan said tornadoes were possible in the southwest corner of Florida, including the Keys, starting Wednesday morning and spanning through the afternoon.",
      "It\u2019s too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could bring to parts of the northern Gulf Coast; however, tropical storm winds are possible for the Florida Keys and south Florida on Wednesday afternoon. Rafael is also forecast to weaken rapidly as it is approaching landfall on the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Keys could get 1 to 3 inches of rain in the latter half of the week, the National Hurricane Center said in its 4 p.m. update Tuesday.",
      "Brennan said the storm could mellow in the Gulf, where average sea surface temperatures have been measured at 76 degrees, and lose its hurricane status. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration experts say hurricanes need 80-degree water, ideally, to fuel their organization and expansion.",
      "\"We could see a slow-motion and a decaying system across the northern Gulf of Mexico,\" he said.",
      "A hurricane warning has been issued for the Cayman Islands, and the Cuban government has upgraded all areas previously covered by hurricane watches to hurricane warning status, which indicates hurricane conditions are likely in 36 hours, the hurricane center said.",
      "Havana is among the areas under a hurricane warning, the center said.",
      "Rafael is forecast to dump 3 to 6 inches of rain across much of the western Caribbean and up to 10 inches in some areas. The heaviest precipitation is expected in Jamaica.",
      "Sorm surge up to 3 feet is expected in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, the hurricane center said. Flooding and mudslides could also occur in parts of Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "This hurricane season has proven to be an active one. Parts of the Southeast are still reeling from hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit two weeks apart in late September and early October.",
      "Forecasters predicted an exceptionally busy hurricane season, in part because of record-high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic.",
      "Experts at Colorado State University, a prominent hurricane forecast center, said this year that they anticipated a \u201chyperactive season.\u201d The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted eight\u00a0to\u00a013 hurricanes\u00a0and 17 to 25 named storms \u2014 the most the agency had ever projected in the annual outlook it issues in May.",
      "Rafael is the 10th named storm since Sept. 24, making the 2024 season\u2019s 10 named storms between Sept. 24 and Nov. 4 the most on record for that time span, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach.",
      "An average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes (classified as Category 3 or above), according to the hurricane center."

    "summary": "Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S.",
    "story": [
      "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers, federal prosecutors said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay $20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. He was also ordered to forfeit $35 million in \u201cill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Prosecutors said the sentence results from Leonard\u2019s first guilty plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation with the government since then, and another guilty plea Tuesday for failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022.",
      "Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Leonard cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled the country. He was later arrested in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0and brought back to the U.S. in December 2023.",
      "Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 \u00bd years for the bribery and fraud charges plus 16 months for failing to appear, to be served consecutively.",
      "\u201cLeonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,\u201d U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201dThe impact of his deceit and manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Francis\u2019 actions led to one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges.",
      "An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one time, Francis owned and operated his family\u2019s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.",
      "In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him classified information and even went so far as redirecting military vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship servicing company.",
      "In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He faced up to 25 years in prison.",
      "While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards.",
      "But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.",
      "He was\u00a0arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance\u00a0\u2014 caught before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia.",
      "The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in an effort to be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under scrutiny.",
      "The\u00a0felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated\u00a0following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine each.",
      "Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the officers\u2019 case committed \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d by withholding information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss the case."

The physical sabotage efforts have coincided with a concerted disinformation campaign by Moscow to weaken political support for Kyiv in the West, officials say.",
      "The director of the U.K.\u2019s MI5 domestic intelligence agency, Ken McCallum, said is a speech on Oct. 8 that Russia has turned to private intelligence operatives and criminals to do \u201ctheir dirty work.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence service \u201cin particular is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: We\u2019ve seen arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness,\u201d McCallum said.",
      "Russia has repeatedly rejected allegations from Western countries that it is orchestrating a sabotage campaign in Europe.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that international media \u201cvery often publish vague\u00a0misinformation, which\u00a0is\u00a0never supported by any reliable data. This, I think, is one of such fakes,\u201d Russian state media reported."
