      "NEW YORK -- The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade brought balloons depicting Buzz Lightyear and Pac-Man to the New York City skies on Thursday, as floats featuring Labubu and Lego graced the streets.",
      "The parade, which started on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side and closed at the iconic Macy\u2019s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, included dozens of balloons, floats, clown groups and marching bands.",
      "It was a chilly day in the city, with temperatures in the 40s, but wind gusts between 25 mph (40 kph) and 30 mph (48 kph), making it feel colder, according to David Stark, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in New York.",
      "Officials watched the forecast closely, since city law prohibits Macy\u2019s from flying full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 23 mph (37 kph) or wind gusts are over 35 mph (56 kph). Weather has grounded the balloons only once, in 1971, but they also sometimes have soared lower than usual because of wind.",
      "But a little cold wasn't a big deal for Megan Christy, who traveled to the city from Greensboro, North Carolina, for the parade, donning a warm onesie as she staked out a spot along the route.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not raining. We\u2019re very excited about that. And it\u2019s not too bad. Not too cold,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great day for a parade.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

After sweeping state elections, he became the chief minister.",

Rajamouli became an international name after \u201cRRR,\u201d or \u201cRise, Roar, Revolt,\u201d his 2022 three-hour epic set in British India.

      "Just like Bollywood, the Telugu film industry also draws its revenue from theatrical releases, television and music rights, overseas distribution and brand partnerships. It is widely regarded as India\u2019s second-highest-grossing film industry, trailing only Bollywood.",
      "Even though the industry is largely controlled by some regionally influential film families and businessmen that have power over movie distribution and screenings, huge marketing campaigns have carried Telugu films across India and beyond.",

    "story": [
      "An AI-generated country song, \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d recently topped Billboard's country digital song sales chart",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When an AI-generated country song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard's country digital song sales chart this month, it was credited to a fictional artist named Breaking Rust \u2014 a white, digitally generated avatar that didn't exist two months ago.",
      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "\u201cThese companies trained their platforms on a volume of recorded music without permission,\u201d Antonuccio said. \u201cIt leaves creators in this strange purgatory where they're not getting compensated.\u201d",
      "Some labels have now shifted from lawsuits to negotiation.

      "For Brown, this situation is a legal and cultural issue.",
      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",
      "Music educators say the issue goes beyond authorship. While AI tools can convincingly approximate sound, they aren\u2019t able to capture the source of it.",
      "\u201cThere are things a real artist conveys that the digital part never will,\u201d said Shelton \u201cShelly\u201d Berg, dean of the University of Miami's Frost School of Music and a Grammy-nominated pianist. He spoke shortly after appearing on on a Future of Music panel at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThey occupy fundamentally different spaces.\u201d",
      "Berg said AI tracks can sometimes be polished in an eerie manner, but the intangible elements of performance remain out of reach.",
      "\u201cThere's an energy between an artist and an audience that happens in real time that you can't see but you can feel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so many light years away from that happening in an AI environment.\u201d",
      "Brown insists he's not anti-AI. He's not even angry with Abushmais. He's proud that his sound inspired someone, but he understands what the moment exposes.",
      "For him, the arrival of an AI artist built on his tone only underscored something he has learned repeatedly in Nashville: talent is one thing, but how the industry assigns value is often something else.",
      "\u201cI go through this every day with real people who steal and borrow from what I do,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo I don't care if it's a robot or a human. They're not giving me credit anyway.\u201d",
      "In a fast-changing landscape, Brown said artists will have one final advantage that machines can't mimic.",

      "Military historian Rick Atkinson, known for his Revolutionary War trilogy, is venturing into graphic books",
      "NEW YORK -- Prize-winning military historian Rick Atkinson, a comic book fan growing up, hadn't imagined his own work being suitable for the illustrated format.",
      "Ten Speed Graphic announced Tuesday that a graphic edition of \u201cThe British Are Coming,\u201d the first volume of Atkinson's acclaimed Revolutionary War trilogy, will be out next June, shortly before the country's 250th anniversary. Five more graphic books are planned, to be written by Nora Neus and illustrated by Federico Pietrobon, with Atkinson in close collaboration.",
      "\u201cThey are entirely amenable to my suggestions, \u2018This isn\u2019t quite right,\u2019 or \u2018I think this needs to be explained,\u2019\u201d Atkinson told The Associated Press. \u201cWith the drawings, I pointed out that John Adams, at the time the revolution began was a relatively young man. And they had made him look like the paunchy, bald John Adams of the vice presidency. And they fixed it.\u201d",
      "Atkinson, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his World War II book \u201cAn Army at Dawn,\u201d has been working on his revolutionary trilogy for a decade and published the second volume, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d this spring. Widely regarded as among the best living military historians, he was a featured commentator in Ken Burns' \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d documentary and has made numerous joint appearances with the filmmaker. He is currently working on the final book of his trilogy.",

      "The author says that he was initially skeptical about the new project.

But the graphic format has been used on everything from \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. Atkinson changed his mind after Ten Speed Graphic, a Penguin Random House imprint, sent him several adaptations, including of the life of Frederick Douglass and Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema\u2019s most popular stars whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday. He was 89.",
      "The actor, who would have turned 90 on Dec. 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.",
      "A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor's death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.",
      "\u201cHe was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,\u201d Modi said on social media platform X.",
      "Often called Bollywood\u2019s \u201cHe-Man,\u201d Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India\u2019s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",
      "Dharmendra\u2019s performance in \u201cSholay\u201d (1975) \u2014 Bollywood\u2019s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India\u2019s greatest films \u2014 earned him enduring popularity. His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy \u201cChupke Chupke\u201d (1975) to the action drama \u201cMera Gaon Mera Desh\u201d (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.",
      "His role in Bollywood classic \u201cSholay,\u201d where he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo\u2019s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood\u2019s most iconic pairings.",
      "His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood\u2019s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps \u2014 Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.",
      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

      "In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India\u2019s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. He also briefly turned to politics, serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Parliament from 2004 to 2009, though his political stint was short-lived.",

      "NEW YORK -- The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself.",
      "Like so many Jamaican teens of his time, he moved to Kingston in the early 1960s and joined a rising musical movement that would help give voice to the country's independence from Great Britain. A decade later, he helped reggae ascend to the international stage with his starring role in the cult favorite \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d and his featured place on the film's classic soundtrack. In the years following, his songs were covered by everyone from Bruce Springsteen to UB40 and confirmed the music's power to inspire or just get you dancing.",
      "Here are a few songs that trace the arc of his career, and of reggae.",
      "Singing along to an easy, bluesy groove, Cliff had a way of sounding both relaxed and fully committed, and could make a nursery rhyme sound like an anthem: \u201cRoses are red / violets are blue / Believe me / I love you.\u201d He also joined a long popular tradition, most famously expressed in such 1970s standards as Billy Joel's \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and Springsteen's \u201cThunder Road,\u201d of offering praise to a very personal kind of beauty: \u201cAlthough you may not have such a fabulous shape / To suit the rest of the world / But you do suit me and that\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d",
      "Like Marvin Gaye's \u201cWhat's Going On\u201d and other anti-war songs, Cliff's \u201cVietnam\u201d was drawn from the horrors of those who had served overseas. \u201cVietnam\u201d was a seething, mid-tempo chant \u2014 \u201cVi-et-nam, Vi-et-nam,\u201d the very name an indictment, in this song for the death of a soldier who had written home to say he would soon be returning, only for his mother to receive a telegram the next day announcing his death.",
      "One of Cliff's many talents was looking clear-eyed at life as it is, and imagining so well what it could be \u2014 a paradise made real by the melody, the feel and lyrics of \u201cWonderful World, Beautiful People,\u201d a vision so inevitable even the likes of President Richard Nixon and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson can't get in the way. \u201cThis is our world, can\u2019t you see? / Everybody wants to live and be free.\u201d",

      "Onstage, he sometimes literally jumped for joy, but Cliff also could call out the deepest notes of despair. The somber, gospel-style \u201cMany Rivers to Cross\u201d was inspired by the racism he encountered in England in the 1960s and tells a story of displacement, longing, fatigue and gathering rage \u2014 but never defeat. \u201cI merely survive because of my pride,\u201d he tells us, a variation of the old saying that hopes dies last.",
      "Cliff\u2019s political songs were so enduring in part because they were so catchy, and because they offered hope without the promise of easy success. Kicked off by a spare horn riff, \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d has a lighter mood than \u201cVietnam,\u201d but just as determined a spirit. \u201cYou must try, try and try, try and try,\u201d Cliff warns. \u201cPersecution you must fear / Win or lose you got to get your share.\u201d",
      "The title track to the movie which would mark the high point of his success, \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d has a spiky, muscular rhythm, the kind you could set to the forward march of a mass protest. It\u2019s a sermon of retribution for oppressors \u2014 \u201cthe harder they fall, one and all\u201d \u2014 and of earthly rewards for those who have been robbed: \u201cSo as sure as the sun will shine / I\u2019m gonna get my share now, what\u2019s mine.\u201d",

      "But hospital administrators, civic leaders and others say the latest push to defeat al-Shabab has come at the expense of health care and other public services.",
      "Somalia's Ministry of Health was allocated $91 million of a national budget exceeding $1 billion this year, with those funds tied mostly to projects backed by outside groups. That's a significant improvement from last year's $52 million, but almost all of that increase came from donors, said Mahad Wasuge, who runs the Somali Public Agenda think tank.",
      "And as the United States has shown, donor money comes and goes.",
      "Even with major setbacks in overall foreign support this year, including from other key benefactors such as Britain, \u201csecurity remains the first priority\u201d for Somali authorities, Wasuge told the AP.",

      "Such facilities in the capital include Banadir Hospital, built with Chinese support in 1977, and De Martino Hospital, established in 1922 by Italian colonialists.",
      "During an AP visit, officials at those hospitals said much of their work would stop without assistance from the United Nations and international groups.",
      "Even at Banadir, Mogadishu\u2019s main public referral hospital, expectations of the Somali government aren\u2019t high. The unit looking after malnourished children depends entirely on donor funds channeled through the humanitarian group Concern Worldwide, said supervisor Dr. Mohamed Haashi.",
      "After 37 people employed in the unit lost their jobs with this year's U.S. aid cuts, Concern Worldwide still pays the salaries of 13 others in addition to milk and food for mothers and babies, Haashi said.",
      "At De Martino Hospital, director Dr. Abdirahim Omar Amin said he worries what will happen when contracts with two other humanitarian groups expire at the end of 2025.",
      "The hospital was looking after dozens of children suffering from diphtheria, an infectious disease of the throat preventable by vaccination but now spreading in rural areas. Parents are not taking their kids for routine vaccinations because they are afraid of militant attacks, Amin said.",

      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud. One option is a requirement that everyone pay 2% of their income, or at least $5 per month, for lower-tier plans.",
      "Even as the White House\u2019s proposal remains in flux, the notion of extending any part of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is likely to rankle conservatives who have sought to repeal and replace the law for well over a decade.",
      "\u201cUntil President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the administration\u2019s health care positions is mere speculation,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump \u201cis very much involved in these talks\u201d and that he is \u201cfocused on unveiling a health care proposal that will fix the system and will bring down costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "But there are signs that parts of the nascent White House plan could get buy-in from Democrats. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted to reopen the government earlier this month, said it \u201crepresents a starting point for serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that President Trump is putting forward any offer at all to extend the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits shows that there is a broad understanding that inaction in this regard will cause serious harm to the American people,\u201d Hassan said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had constructive conversations with many of my Republican colleagues who I believe want to get this done,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThey understand that the vast majority of people who benefit from these tax credits live in states the President won, and that the President\u2019s own pollsters have underscored the enormous political urgency of Republicans acting.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Trump fell short in a push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, an embarrassing defeat for Republicans who had just seized control of all levers of power in Washington. The GOP has failed to coalesce around a unified health care proposal since, and the expiration of the pandemic-era subsidies gives Trump and his party an opportunity to put their own stamp on the issue.",
      "As the White House worked quietly on its plan, led by the Domestic Policy Council, key lawmakers on Capitol Hill have drafted their own proposals. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and others have proposed various ideas for redirecting the program\u2019s spending on federal subsidies into health savings accounts that enrollees could use to shop for plans or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott's plan has been discussed with the White House multiple times since it was released Thursday, according to a person familiar not authorized to discuss the private conversations.",
      "The draft of the White House plan would allow those in lower-tier plans, such as the bronze-level or catastrophic plans, to put money into health savings accounts.",
      "It would also codify the \u201cprogram integrity rule\u201d to further help root out fraud, waste and abuse.",

      "Experts have mixed reactions to the recent U.N. climate talks in the Amazon",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- After an agreement from U.N. climate talks in the Amazon that fell short of many nations' expectations, experts found some bright spots alongside weighty reasons for worry in the fight against global warming.",
      "The Associated Press asked 17 experts \u2014 diplomats, analysts, advocates and scientists \u2014 the simple question: After the talks, known as COP30, in the city of Belem, what's next?",
      "\u201cWe leave here with a clear signal, very very clear signal, that we have entered the era of implementation,\" said U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"As we move forward, it\u2019s about doing. It's about rolling sleeves up.\u201d",
      "Others look at the key failure of not delivering a road map to phase out coal, oil and gas \u2014 the main causes of warming. The road map had the public support of Brazil's president and more than 80 nations, but powerful opponents.",
      "\u201cThis should have been the moment. A COP in the Amazon, a president calling for a fossil fuel transition road map, the science screaming for action. But the world blinked again,'' Panama climate negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez said. \u201dThe next year will be harder on communities and ecosystems. Impacts will intensify, because emissions are not slowing down.\"",
      "Stiell pointed to seven different paragraphs in the agreements from Belem that could spur action for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fewer fossil fuels. The COP presidency highlighted 117 \u201caction agenda\u201d items mostly for business to put pledges into real-life action.",
      "That agenda includes a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation. Among the most ambitious actions is a push to raise $1 trillion for renewable electrical grids and energy storage.",
      "One specific action that Stiell and several others emphasized was a new \u201cglobal implementation accelerator,\" a voluntary and cooperative system designed to help nations that want to do more than they've previously proposed in their climate fighting plans. The emphasis is on getting money to where it's needed.",
      "\u201cIf the \u2018ambition accelerator\u2019 can help to do this, it will make a massive difference to the global warming outlook,\u201d said Bill Hare, CEO of the climate science and policy institute Climate Analytics.",
      "Because they couldn't get a consensus at the talks in Belem, the COP30 presidency promised to create two new \u201croad maps,\" one to guide the transition away from fossil fuels and another to stop deforestation. But those road maps won't have the force of something agreed upon in UN talks.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago said his office will study both areas extensively and use science and economics to come up with those plans. He said they would be tailored to different countries' needs.",
      "Do Lago also promised that his office will join with Colombia and the Netherlands to organize a special fossil fuel phaseout conference scheduled next April.",
      "\u201cIf they come with real timelines, accountability and finance, they have the potential to shape global action and hold governments to their word,\u201d said Mariana Paoli of the anti-poverty group Christian Aid. \u201cThey don\u2019t have power on their own, but they can create the structure around which real change is built.\u201d",

      "Diamonds helped transform Botswana from one of the world\u2019s poorest nations into one of Africa\u2019s success stories",
      "GABORONE, Botswana -- In a village outside Botswana \u2019s capital, Keorapetse Koko sat on an aging couch in her sparsely furnished home, stunned that a career \u2014 and an entire nation\u2019s economy \u2014 built on diamonds had fallen so far, so fast.",
      "For 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world\u2019s poorest nations into one of Africa\u2019s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country.",
      "Botswana became the world\u2019s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums.",
      "The stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana\u2019s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the \u201cresource curse\u201d of building its economy on a single natural asset \u2014 and unlike many African nations, it was a success.",
      "But Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa\u2019s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India.",
      "\u201cI have debts and I don\u2019t know how I am going to pay them,\u201d said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. \u201cEvery month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?\u201d",
      "Botswana, which has unearthed some of the world\u2019s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers. Its marketing message has been simple: Its stones are conflict-free and help fund development.",
      "\u201cDiamonds built our country,\u201d said Joseph Tsimako, president of the Botswana Mine Workers Union, which represents about 10,000 workers in the nation of 2.5 million people. \u201cNow, as the world changes, we must find a way to make sure they don\u2019t destroy the lives of the people who helped build it.\u201d",
      "He warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana\u2019s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there.",
      "Diamond exports, roughly 80% of Botswana\u2019s foreign earnings and a third of government revenue, have tumbled.",
      "Debswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers\u2019 diamond mining unit.",
      "In September, Botswana\u2019s national statistics agency reported a 43% drop in diamond output in the second quarter, the steepest fall in the country\u2019s modern mining history. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink 3% this year, the second consecutive contraction.",
      "The global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have \u201cgiven stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,\u201d said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association.",
      "The gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%.",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades has raised questions about corruption and negligence in the renovations of the apartment complex where at least 128 people died.",
      "An intense fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court complex in Hong Kong's northern suburbs Wednesday afternoon, with flames covering seven of eight of the towers. The complex was home to some 4,800 residents, some of whom had raised safety concerns about the renovations more than year before the fire.",
      "Police on Wednesday arrested three men from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. They are now out on bail. Authorities then arrested seven men and one woman, ranging in age from 40 to 63, including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consultant company and project managers supervising the renovation, in a corruption probe.",
      "Police have not identified the company where the suspects worked, but documents posted to the homeowners association\u2019s website showed that the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company was in charge of renovations. Police have seized boxes of documents from the company, where phones rang unanswered Thursday.",
      "Officials also said they were investigating the materials used, both the netting on the scaffolding and the foam panels, and their role in the blaze.",
      "For almost a year, some residents at the Wang Fuk Court complex had been raising safety concerns to Hong Kong authorities about the construction netting being used in the renovation project, according to documents reviewed by the AP, specifically about the netting that covered the scaffolding.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s labor department in a statement on Saturday confirmed they had received such complaints, adding that officials had carried out 16 inspections of Wang Fuk Court\u2019s renovation project since July 2024, and had warned contractors multiple times via writing that they must ensure they met fire safety requirements.",
      "The labor department said they had reviewed the product quality certificate of the netting and that it was in line with standards.",
      "Those very materials are now of great interest after preliminary investigations showed the fire started on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings. It then spread rapidly as the foam panels caught fire, said Chris Tang, the city's secretary for security. Police also said they had been looking at highly flammable foam panels.",
      "\u201cThe blaze ignited the foam panels, causing the glass to shatter and leading to a swift intensification of the fire and its spread into the interior spaces,\u201d Tang said.",
      "Further, first responders found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, said Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services, though he did not say how many were not working or if others were.",
      "It took firefighters a day to bring the fire under control, and it was not fully extinguished until Friday morning \u2014 some 40 hours after it started.",
      "Crews prioritized apartments from which they had received emergency calls during the blaze but were unable to reach in the hours that the fire burned out of control, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services, told reporters.",

      "The head of Turkey\u2019s Diyanet religious affairs directorate showed Leo the soaring tiled domes of the 17th-century mosque and the Arabic inscriptions on its columns, as Leo nodded in understanding.",
      "The Vatican had said Leo would observe a \u201cbrief minute of silent prayer\u201d there, but it didn't appear that he had. The imam of the mosque, Asgin Tunca, said he had invited Leo to pray, since the mosque was \u201cAllah's house,\u201d but the pope declined.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the visit, Tunca said he had told the pope: \"It\u2019s not my house, not your house, (it\u2019s the) house of Allah,\u201d he said. He said he told Leo: \u201c'If you want, you can worship here,\u2019 I said. But he said, \u2018That\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wanted to see the mosque, wanted to feel (the) atmosphere of the mosque, I think. And was very pleased,\u201d he said.",

      "Leo, history's first American pope, was following in the footsteps of his recent predecessors, who all made high-profile visits to the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, as it is officially known, in a gesture of respect to Turkey\u2019s Muslim majority. Leo removed his shoes and walked through the carpeted mosque in his white socks.",
      "But the visits have always raised questions about whether the pope would pray in the Muslim house of worship, or at the very least pause to gather thoughts in a meditative silence.",
      "There were no doubts in 2014 when Pope Francis visited: He stood for two minutes of silent prayer facing east, his head bowed, eyes closed and hands clasped in front of him. The Grand Mufti of Istanbul, Rahmi Yaran, told the pope afterwards, \u201cMay God accept it.\u201d",
      "When Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey in 2006, tensions were high because Benedict had offended many in the Muslim world a few months earlier with a speech in Regensburg, Germany that was widely interpreted as linking Islam and violence.",
      "The Vatican added a visit to the Blue Mosque at the last minute in a bid to reach out to Muslims, and Benedict was warmly welcomed. He observed a moment of silent prayer, head bowed, as the imam prayed next to him, facing east.",

      "After the mosque visit, Leo held a private meeting with Turkey\u2019s Christian leaders at the Syriac Orthodox Church of Mor Ephrem.

      "Before the 16-year-old vanished in a Mexico City suburb, mother and son yearned for the winter season. They loved buying natural Christmas trees. To brighten them up, they hung Diego\u2019s favorite decorations: figurines of Mickey and Minnie Mouse.",

      "Archaeologist Shadia Abdrabo is working to create an online database of Sudan's archaeological sites and museum collections",
      "PARIS -- In a dimly lit office in a corner of the French National Institute for Art History, Sudanese archaeologist Shadia Abdrabo studies a photograph of pottery made in her country around 7,000 B.C. She carefully types a description of the Neolithic artifact into a spreadsheet.",
      "As the war between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) rages on, the curator from Sudan\u2019s National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) is on a yearlong research grant in France with one mission: to build an online database of the African nation\u2019s archaeological sites, museum collections and historical archives.",
      "Soon after the war in Sudan started, in April 2023, museums were looted and destroyed. It\u2019s unclear what exactly went missing, but Abdrabo says her task is to find out \u2014 and time is of the essence.",
      "\u201cWe have to work fast to secure our collections. We\u2019ve already lost two museums and we don\u2019t want to lose more,\u201d Abdrabo told The Associated Press.",
      "She says two regional museums in El Geneina and Nyala were almost completely destroyed, while in Khartoum, the National Museum \u2014 which held an estimated 100,000 objects before the war \u2014 was ransacked by militias who posted videos online of their fighters inside the storeroom.",
      "The National Museum had pieces dating back to prehistoric times, including from the Kerma Kingdom and the Napatan era when Kushite kings ruled the region as well as from the Meroitic civilization that built Sudan\u2019s pyramids. Other galleries displayed later Christian and Islamic objects.",
      "Among its most valuable items were mummies dating back to 2,500 B.C., some of the oldest and most archaeologically significant in the world as well as royal Kushite treasures.",
      "UNESCO raised the alarm on reports of plundering saying the \u201cthreat to culture appears to have reached an unprecedented level.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart was broken, you know? It\u2019s not just objects that we lost. We lost research, we lost studies, we lost many things,\u201d Abdrabo said.",
      "Last month, hundreds of people were left dead and more than 80,000 others forced into displacement after the capture of North Darfur\u2019s capital, El Fasher, by the RSF. For Abdrabo the work is deeply personal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m from Nubia, from the north, an area filled with monuments, archaeological sites and ancient life,\u201d she said. The region was home to some of the world\u2019s earliest kingdoms that rivaled ancient Egypt in power and wealth.",
      "She was working at the national museum in the capital Khartoum when the war started.",
      "\u201cWe thought it would finish soon \u2026 but then life started getting really difficult: not just the bombing, but there was no electricity, no water,\u201d she said. With her three sisters, she fled north \u2014 first to Atbara, then to Abri, and eventually to Port Sudan.",
      "During that time, Abdrabo and her NCAM colleagues worked tirelessly to try and protect Sudan\u2019s 11 museums and sites \u2014 some designated with UNESCO World Heritage status \u2014 moving pieces to safe rooms and secret locations.",
      "But efforts to protect Sudan\u2019s art were too slow, said Ali Nour, a Sudanese cultural heritage advocate.",
      "\u201cWhile applications were being drafted, sites were being emptied. While risk assessments were reviewed, entire archives vanished,\u201d Nour wrote in an article for the U.K.-based International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works.",

      "A massive fire in Hong Kong's Tai Po district has become the deadliest in the city's memory, causing 128 deaths with 200 people unaccounted-for",
      "HONG KONG -- It was just after 3 p.m. when William Li received the unusual call from his wife, who was at work, saying she'd heard from a friend that their building was on fire.",
      "There were no alarms, no signs of smoke in his 2nd floor apartment, and no burning smell to give a sense of urgency, so the 40-year-old office worker who was home on a day off decided to change from his pajamas before heading outside.",
      "But when he opened his door eight minutes after his wife called, it was already too late to escape as he was immediately engulfed by thick, black smoke.",
      "\u201cEverything went black before my eyes,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI thought to myself: I'm in serious trouble.\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of Wednesday's blaze at the Wang Fuk Court complex on the outskirts of Hong Kong. It would burn for more than 40 hours and engulf seven of the complex's eight buildings before being finally extinguished Friday morning, claiming the lives of at least 128 people with some 200 unaccounted-for, making it Hong Kong's deadliest fire since 1948.",
      "From Li's apartment near ground zero where the fire broke out, the flames shot up bamboo scaffolding covered with nylon netting that had been erected for construction work. It ignited polystyrene panels that had been placed over windows and blew out the glass, allowing the blaze to spread inside. Winds helped the fire jump from building to building.",
      "Authorities are investigating whether the netting covering the bamboo scaffolding, commonly used in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia, met fire-safety requirements; why windows were covered with foam panels; and why fire alarms did not sound.",
      "Already police have arrested three people \u2014 the directors of a construction company and an engineering consultant \u2014 and Hong Kong's anti-corruption authorities have arrested a further eight including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consulting company and the renovation project managers.",
      "The complex is in Tai Po, a market town that in the late 1970s was designated as a \u201cnew town,\u201d with many high-rise apartments built. The district is now home to about 300,000 of the city\u2019s 7.5 million population, a mix of affluent, middle-class and lower-income groups.",
      "Li grew up in the Wang Fuk Court complex, while resident Ding Chan and her husband moved there as adults as soon as it was built in the early 1980s, lured by the appeal of the quiet suburban neighborhood north of Hong Kong, far away from the city\u2019s commercial center.",
      "Chan had left her apartment a half-hour before the fire broke out and was at work as a cleaner when she started receiving frantic calls from friends about the blaze.",
      "\u201cI did not believe it at first,\u201d the 70-year-old told the AP.",
      "By the time she got back to the housing estate shortly after 3 p.m. \u2014 around the same time Li's wife was calling him with her warning \u2014 she could see the flames already spreading quickly and it wasn't long before it reached her own building, and there was nothing she could do but watch.",
      "\u201cI had never seen such a massive fire in my entire lifetime,\u201d she said.",
      "Her husband, I.N. Kong, who is also 70, was also fortunately not at home when the fire broke out.",
      "But Chan, who juggles two jobs and often works six days a week, and her husband who works as an electrician, are now faced with having to rebuild their lives from scratch.",
      "Their unit, which they spent more than a decade paying off, is likely uninhabitable now and Chan said they did not know how they were going to survive for the next months, let alone the longer term future.",
      "They have been put up temporarily in a local hotel, but don't know what comes next.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t slept for two nights,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere am I going to stay?\"",
      "The government has made emergency assistance available to residents, and donations have also been pouring in, but it was not yet clear what long-term financial aid those in need will receive.",
      "Of the more than 4,600 residents in Wang Fuk Court, more than one-third are over 65, like Chan and her husband, according to Midland Realty data based on the 2021 census.",
      "Some 900 people were taken to emergency shelters in the immediate aftermath of the fire, and hundreds of volunteers, including off-duty nurses, social workers and psychological counselors, flocked to the district to offer help.",
      "Li took to social media to share his ordeal, posting details Friday on a Tai Po Facebook group, writing he hoped to help the community \u201cheal and rebuild together.\u201d By Saturday morning it has generated more than 1,000 comments and had been shared nearly 10,000 times.",

      "\u201cOnce my two neighbors had been rescued, I was left alone in the flat,\u201d he recalled.",
      "\u201cAt that moment my feelings were very heavy, because I knew I had to leave this home, and that it might be swallowed by the fire \u2014 I felt reluctant, but I had no choice. I had to escape.\u201d",
      "As he climbed down the ladder, firefighters yelled at him to cover his head due to falling debris, while hosing him down with water to protect him from the flames.",
      "\u201cThe cold water drenched my whole body and the emotions were overwhelming, hard to describe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I felt very lucky.\u201d",
      "Dozens of residents on higher floors of the 32-story buildings were trapped even longer, as firefighters battled extreme heat to conduct door-to-door searches. Li said he had only moved down to the second floor in September, and said he had heard that his former neighbors on the 29th floor had all perished in the blaze.",
      "About two hours after getting rescued, Li finally got to see his wife, son and daughter, who had been watching the blaze from outside, in an emotional reunion.",
      "\u201cMy wife cried until her tears were completely dry, unable to cry anymore,' he said. \u201dMy daughter immediately rushed over to hug me saying \u2018daddy didn\u2019t die, daddy didn't die.' My son sat quietly to the side, very calm, but tears kept streaming down his face.\"",

      "Pope Leo XIV is heading to join Orthodox patriarchs in commemorating an important moment in Christian history",
      "IZNIK, Turkey -- IZNIK, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV traveled Friday to join Orthodox patriarchs in commemorating an important moment in Christian history, gathering at the site in Turkey of an unprecedented A.D. 325 meeting of bishops to pray that Christians might once again be reunited.",
      "Leo, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and other Christian leaders were meeting on the shores of Lake Iznik, the site of the Council of Nicaea that produced a creed, or statement of faith, that is still recited by millions of Christians today.",
      "Leo flew by helicopter to Iznik from Istanbul to take part in an ecumenical prayer to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Nicaea meeting, the highlight of his visit to Turkey. He arrived just after the Muslim call to prayer rang out from a nearby mosque.",
      "The Nicaea gathering happened at a time when the Eastern and Western churches were still united. They split in the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope. But even today, Catholic, Orthodox and most historic Protestant groups accept the Nicaean Creed, making it a point of agreement and the most widely accepted creed in Christendom.",
      "As a result, celebrating its origins at the site of its creation with the spiritual leaders of the Catholic and Orthodox churches and other Christian representatives marked a historic moment in the centuries-old quest to reunite all Christians.",
      "In Iznik, the Christian leaders were to light candles and pray at the lakeside archaeological excavations of the ancient Basilica of Saint Neophytos in a service featuring alternating Catholic and Orthodox hymns.",
      "The stone foundations of the basilica, which were recently uncovered by the receding waters of Lake Iznik, are believed to be on the site of an earlier church that hosted the council 1,700 years ago.",
      "Speaking Friday before arriving, Leo said the creed wasn\u2019t merely a doctrinal formula, but the \u201cessential core of the Christian faith.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, its development is organic, akin to that of a living reality, gradually bringing to light and expressing more fully the essential heart of the faith,\u201d he said.",
      "Christians are a minority in predominantly Sunni Muslim Turkey, and ahead of the prayer in Iznik, around 20 members of a small Turkish Islamic party staged a brief protest, saying the encounter posed a threat to Turkey\u2019s sovereignty and national identity.",
      "Under a heavy police presence, Mehmet Kaygusuz, a member of the New Welfare Party, read a statement denouncing what he said were efforts to establish a \u201cVatican-like Greek Orthodox state\u201d in Turkey. The group dispersed peacefully shortly after.",
      "Leo arrived in Turkey  on Thursday, emphasizing a message of peace as he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It\u2019s a message he\u2019ll bring to Lebanon on Sunday, the second and final leg of the trip for history\u2019s first American pope.",
      "Iznik resident Suleyman Bulut, 35, acknowledged his town\u2019s deep historical and spiritual significance for Christians and said he had no issue with them coming to honor their heritage. \u201cMuslims (too) should go and visit places that belong to us in the rest of the world, in Europe,\u201d he said. But Hasan Maral, a 41-year-old shopkeeper said he felt uncomfortable with visit. \u201cThe pope coming here feels contradictory to my faith,\u201d he said.",

      "Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year\u2019s holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online",
      "NEW YORK -- Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute \u2014 with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes \u2014 or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \u201cthe story isn\u2019t just that shoppers stayed home; it\u2019s that they\u2019re changing how and when they shop,\u201d Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday.

This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \u201cthey\u2019re still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday \u2014 before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s barrage of tariffs on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. And despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year\u2019s holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security \u2014 amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing \u2014 with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024\u2019s holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",

      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry \u2014 such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children \u2014 rather than eradicate it.",

      "Minnesota's Democratic U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, are among those strategizing to save the industry. Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Black Friday may no longer be the retail bacchanalia of years past, when the promise of one-time bargains caused people to leave Thanksgiving tables for malls where some customers got into fistfights over toys or TVs. But the event still has enough enthusiasts to make it the biggest shopping day in the U.S.",
      "For that reason, the day retains its crown as the official start of the holiday shopping season. This year's kickoff comes as companies navigate an uncertain economic environment and wrestle with the volatility of President Donald Trump 's wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods.",
      "Many have absorbed some of the costs and pulled back on hiring instead of raising prices for customers. Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month to the lowest since April \u2014 when Trump announced his tariffs \u2014 in the aftermath of the government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.",
      "Shoppers nonetheless have remained resilient and willing to spend, at least judging by the solid quarterly sales reports from Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. But many retail executives also say customers are focusing on deals and have been selective in what they're buying.",
      "Aron Boxer, 50, from Greenwich, Connecticut, said he delayed buying a car this year amid worries about tariffs. He said he'll be looking for deals on toys on Cyber Monday but is also willing to wait to the end for the best discount.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs definitely are not behind me, and I am concerned about it,\" the founder of an educational services company and a life coaching service said. \u201cI did consider buying earlier this year, but I feel like some people made some pretty bad business decisions anticipating tariffs to have a bigger impact than they did.\u201d",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,\" said Jill Renslow, chief business development and marketing officer at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which plans to give gift cards and other giveaways to the first 250 customers who show up at 7 a.m. on Friday. \u201cThe last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.\u201d",

      "Tariffs have played a role in stores' merchandising and pricing strategies. Many retailers accelerated shipments of some holiday merchandise before the tariffs took effect while also absorbing some of the extra import costs. But stores still have passed on some of the expense for items like toys, which are largely sourced in China.",

      "Thick smoke continued to pour out of the Wang Fuk Court complex, a dense cluster of high-rise towers housing thousands of people in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near the border with the mainland. Flames can still be seen inside the buildings Thursday evening.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said contact had been lost with 279 people around midnight Thursday. Rescues were continuing in some of the towers, but authorities did not provide updates on the missing people or how many were still trapped inside the ravaged buildings Thursday during a press conference.",
      "Firefighters have been trying to control the flames since midafternoon Wednesday, when the fire started in bamboo scaffolding and construction netting and then spread across seven of the complex\u2019s eight buildings. Fires in four buildings had been effectively put out, with the remaining three towers under control, authorities said Thursday afternoon.",
      "Fifty-one people were found dead on the scene, Hong Kong authorities said, and four others died in the hospital. One firefighter was among the dead.",
      "More than 70 people were injured, according to the city\u2019s Hospital Authority, many suffering from burn and inhalation injuries. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters overnight.",

      "\u201cWhen the fire started, I told her on the phone to escape. But once she left the flat, the corridor and stairs were all filled with smoke and it was all dark, so she had no choice but to go back to the flat,\u201d he said, as he waited in one of the shelters overnight.",
      "Winter and Sandy Chung, who lived in one of the towers, said they saw sparks fly around as they evacuated Wednesday afternoon. Although they were safe, they were worried about their home. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep the entire night,\u201d Winter Chung, 75, told The Associated Press on Thursday.",

It was believed to have been installed by the construction company but the purpose was not clear. Secretary for Security Chris Tang said they would investigate the materials further.",
      "The housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2,000 apartments for about 4,800 residents, including many older people. It was built in the 1980s and had been undergoing a major renovation. Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency said on Thursday it was launching a probe into possible corruption relating to the renovation project.",

    "story": [
      "Valuable eels are in decline all over the world, leading to a new push for restrictions on trade to try to help stave off extinction",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Eels are the stuff of nightmares \u2014 slimy, snakelike creatures that lay millions of eggs before dying so their offspring can return home to rivers and streams. They've existed since the time of the dinosaurs, and some species are more poorly understood than those ancient animals.",
      "Yet they're also valuable seafood fish that are declining all over the world, leading to a new push for restrictions on trade to help stave off extinction.",
      "Freshwater eels are critically important for the worldwide sushi industry, and some species have declined by more than 90% since the 1980s. The eels have succumbed to a combination of river dams, hydroelectric turbines, pollution, habitat loss, climate change, illegal poaching and overfishing, according to scientists. Some environmental organizations have called for consumers to boycott eel at sushi restaurants.",
      "The loss of eels motivated the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES, to consider new restrictions to protect the wriggling fish. The members of CITES, an international treaty, met in Uzbekistan this week to determine if the new rules on trade are needed. Member nations voted against the new protections on Thursday.",
      "Conservation groups said the protections were long overdue, but not everyone was on board. Some fishing groups, seafood industry members and regulatory agencies in the U.S., China and Japan \u2014 all countries where eel is economically important \u2014 have spoken out against restricting the trade.",
      "The push for more restrictions is the work of \u201can international body dominated by volunteer scientists and unelected bureaucrats,\" said Mitchell Feigenbaum, one of North America's largest eel dealers and an advocate for the industry. But several conservation groups countered that the protections were needed.",
      "\u201cThis measure is vital to strengthen trade monitoring, aid fisheries management, and ensure the species\u2019 long-term survival,\" said Susan Lieberman, vice president of international policy for Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "The eels in question are the eels of the anguilla genus, which spend their lives in freshwater but migrate to the ocean to spawn. They are distinct from the familiar, grinning moray eels, which are popular in aquariums and are mostly marine fish, and the electric eels, which live in South America.",
      "Anguilla eels, especially baby eels called elvers, are valuable because they are used as seed stock by Asian aquaculture companies that raise them to maturity for use as food. Freshwater eel is known as unagi in Japan, and it's a key ingredient in numerous sushi dishes. Eel is also culturally significant in Japan, where people have eaten the fish for thousands of years.",
      "The elvers have become more valuable in the U.S. over the last 15 years because of the steep decline of eels elsewhere in the world. While the population of American eels has fallen, the drop has not been as severe as Japanese and European eels. Attempts to list American eels under the Endangered Species Act in the U.S. have failed.",
      "Maine is the only U.S. state with a significant fishery for the elvers, and it is heavily regulated. Maine's baby eels were worth more than $1,200 per pound at the docks in 2024, and they were worth more than $2,000 per pound the year before that.",
      "CITES, which is one of the world's largest multinational wildlife agreements, extended protections to European eels in 2009. The organization considered adding more than a dozen more eel species, including the American and Japanese eels, to its list of protected species.",
      "Adding the eels to the list would mean exporters would need a permit to ship them. Before the permit could be granted, a scientific authority in the home country would have to determine that the export would not be detrimental to the species' survival and that the eels weren\u2019t taken illegally under national wildlife laws. That is significant because poaching of eels is a major threat, and rare species are often illegally passed off as more common ones, CITES documents state.",

      "Japan and China have both told CITES that they don't support listing the eels. And in the U.S., the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which regulates the American eel fishery, submitted testimony to CITES opposing the listing.",
      "The U.S.'s own management of eels is sufficient to protect the species, said Toni Kerns, fisheries policy director with the commission.",
      "\u201cWe don't feel that the proposal provides enough information on how the black market would be curbed,\u201d Kerns said. \u201cWe are very concerned about how it would potentially restrict trade in the United States.\"",
      "A coalition of industry groups in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also submitted a request that the protection be rejected, saying CITES' assertion that international trade is causing eel populations to decline is \u201cnot supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d",
      "The strong demand for eels is a reason to protect the trade with new rules, said Nastya Timoshyna, office director for Europe with TRAFFIC, a U.K.-based nonprofit that fights wildlife trafficking.",
      "Illegal shipping is not the only reason the eels are in decline, but working with industry to cut down illegal trade will give the fish a better chance at survival, Timoshyna said.",

      "Britain\u2019s Labour Party government is set to deliver a high-stakes budget aimed at fixing public finances and boosting economic growth",
      "LONDON -- After being elected in a landslide last year, Britain\u2019s Labour Party government delivered a budget it billed as a one-off dose of tax hikes to fix the public finances, get debt down, ease the cost of living and spur economic growth.",
      "A year on, inflation remains stubbornly high, government borrowing is up and the economy is turgid. The annual budget, due on Wednesday, is expected to bring more tax hikes in pursuit of the same elusive economic boom.",
      "Rain Newton-Smith, head of business group the Confederation of British Industry, said Monday that \u201cit feels less like we\u2019re on the move, and more like we\u2019re stuck in \u2018Groundhog Day.\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just businesses who are concerned. Alarmed by the government\u2019s consistently dire poll ratings, some Labour lawmakers are mulling the once-unthinkable idea of ousting Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who led them to victory less than 18 months ago.",
      "Luke Tryl, director of pollster More in Common, said voters \"don\u2019t understand why there has not been positive change.",
      "\u201cThis could be a last-chance saloon moment for the government.\"",
      "The government says Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will make \u201ctough but right decisions\u201d in her budget to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "She has limited room for maneuver. Britain's economy, the world's sixth-largest, has underperformed its long-run average since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the center-left Labour government elected in July 2024 has struggled to deliver promised economic growth.",
      "Like other Western economies, Britain\u2019s public finances have been squeezed by the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs. The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "The government currently spends more than 100 billion pounds ($130 billion) a year servicing the U.K.\u2019s debt, which stands at around 95% of annual national income.",
      "Adding to pressure is the fact that Labour governments historically have had to work harder than Conservative administrations to convince businesses and the financial markets that they are economically sound.",
      "Reeves is mindful of how financial markets can react when the government\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up. The short-lived premiership of Liz Truss ended in October 2022 after her package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets, drove down the value of the pound and sent borrowing costs soaring.",
      "Luke Hickmore, an investment director at Aberdeen Investments, said the bond market is the \u201cultimate reality check\u201d for budget policy.",
      "\u201cIf investors lose faith, the cost of borrowing rises sharply, and political leaders have little choice but to change course,\u201d he said.",
      "The government has ruled out public spending cuts of the kind seen during 14 years of Conservative government, and its attempts to cut Britain\u2019s huge welfare bill have been stymied by Labour lawmakers.",
      "That leaves tax increases as the government\u2019s main revenue-raising option.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re very much not in the position that Rachel Reeves hoped to be in,\u201d said Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank.",
      "Instead of an economy that has \u201csparked into life,\u201d enabling higher spending and lower taxes, Rutter said Reeves must decide whether \u201cto fill a big fiscal black hole with tax increases or spending cuts.\u201d",
      "The budget comes after weeks of messy mixed messaging that saw Reeves signal she would raise income tax rates \u2013 breaking a key election promise \u2013 before hastily reversing course.",
      "In a Nov. 4 speech, Reeves laid the groundwork for income tax hikes by arguing that the economy is sicker and the global outlook worse than the government knew when it took office.",
      "After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on the public finances, the government signaled it preferred a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures such as a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on expensive homes and a pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers.",
      "The government will try to ease the sting with sweeteners including an above-inflation boost to pension payments for millions of retirees and a freeze on train fares.",
      "Critics say more taxes on employees and businesses, following tax hikes on businesses in last year\u2019s budget, will push the economy further into a low-growth doom loop.",
      "Patrick Diamond, professor in public policy at Queen Mary University of London, said satisfying both markets and voters is difficult.",
      "\u201cYou can give markets confidence, but that probably means raising taxes, which is very unpopular with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you can give voters confidence by trying to minimize the impact of tax rises, but that makes markets nervous because they feel that the government doesn\u2019t have a clear fiscal plan.\u201d",
      "The budget comes as Starmer is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s office sparked a flurry of speculation earlier this month by preemptively telling news outlets that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership. What looked like an attempt to strengthen Starmer\u2019s authority backfired. The reports set off jitters verging on panic among Labour lawmakers, who fear the party is heading for a big defeat at the next election.",
      "That election does not have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.",
      "But analysts say a misfiring budget could be another nail in the coffin of Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cBoth Starmer and Reeves are really unpopular,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThey may be hanging on for now, but I don\u2019t think people will be giving you great odds that they\u2019ll necessarily last the course of the Parliament,\u201d which runs until the next election.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market is climbing again Tuesday on hopes for a coming cut to interest rates.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.8% after breaking out of a morning lull, where it bobbed between small gains and losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 650 points, or 1.4%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher.",
      "Stocks got a boost from easing yields in the bond market. Lower interest rates can cover up many sins in financial markets, including prices going too high, and hopes are high that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting to juice the economy further.",
      "A raft of mixed economic data on Tuesday left traders betting on a nearly 85% probability that the Fed will cut in December, according to data from CME Group. That\u2019s roughly the same as a day before and up sharply from the coin flip\u2019s chance that traders saw just a week ago.",
      "One of Thursday's reports said that shoppers bought less at U.S. retailers  in September than economists expected. Another said confidence among U.S. consumers worsened  by more than expected, a second signal that the economy could potentially use the help of lower interest rates.",
      "Easier rates can boost the economy by encouraging households and companies to borrow more and investors to pay higher prices for investments than they would otherwise.",
      "A third report, meanwhile, said that inflation at the wholesale level was a touch worse in September than economists expected, but a closely tracked underlying trend was slightly better. That\u2019s important because lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and high inflation is the main deterrent that could keep the Fed from cutting rates.",
      "After taking all the data together, economists suggested the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, could be leaning toward cutting rates on Dec. 10. The Fed has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market.",
      "\u201cTaking a pause on rate cuts would probably do more damage to sentiment than a cut would help,\u201d according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, who also said \u201cPowell doesn\u2019t need to be the Grinch that stole Christmas.\u201d",
      "Easier interest rates can give particularly big boosts to smaller companies, because many of them need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of the smallest U.S. stocks jumped 2.1% to lead the market.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, several retailers leaped after delivering stronger profits for the summer than analysts expected.",

      "Britain's Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is on her way to deliver a crucial tax-raising budget statement to lawmakers",
      "LONDON -- Britain's Treasury chief Rachel Reeves left her offices at No. 11 Downing Street Wednesday to deliver a crucial tax-raising budget statement to lawmakers that she hopes will manage to please financial markets, businesses and jaded voters at the same time.",
      "Following weeks of speculation and mixed signals that unsettled the markets, Reeves held out her red ministerial briefcase to the awaiting media, as is custom and tradition.",
      "The budget, her second since Britain's center-left Labour government returned to power after 14 years with a landslide election victory in July 2024, could prove pivotal in the fortunes of both Reeves and her boss, Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Reeves is set to tell lawmakers that more tax-raising measures are necessary to plug a hole in the public finances. In a video statement before she headed to the House of Commons, Reeves said she would \u201ctake the fair and necessary choices\u201d to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "\u201cAnd I will push ahead with the biggest drive for growth in a generation,\" she said.",
      "Reeves, the first woman to hold the post of chancellor of the exchequer, said much the same at her first budget a little more than a year ago. She insisted at the time it would be the one and only big tax-raising budget in this parliamentary term, which is due to run to 2029.",
      "Unfortunately for Reeves, the British economy, the world's sixth-largest, is not doing as well as she hoped, with many critics blaming her decision last year to slap taxes on business. Though there were signs that the economy was on the mend in the first half the year, when it was the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, it has faltered again.",
      "\u201cThe chancellor faces a delicate balancing act of conveying fiscal stability while advancing the growth agenda,\u201d said Peter Arnold, chief economist at consulting firm EY U.K.",
      "False dawns have been a regular feature of the British economy since the global financial crisis of 2008-9. If the economy had kept growing at precrisis levels, it would be nearly a quarter bigger than it is now. That's a lot of lost activity \u2014 and a lot of lost tax revenue going into the Treasury's coffers.",

      "In addition to the long-term costs of the financial crisis, Britain\u2019s public finances, like those of other nations, have been further squeezed by the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs. The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, Reeves has a bunch of spending commitments aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains stubbornly high, including making up for a series of about-turns on planned welfare cuts and the likely ditching of a cap on benefits paid out to families with several children. That and measures such as freezing rail fares or cutting green taxes on energy bills don't come cheap.",
      "All in all, economists think that she will have to find something like 20-30 billion pounds ($26-39 billion). After flirting with the idea of hiking income tax rates, which would break a key Labour election promise, Reeves now looks likely to raise money from smaller, and more fiddly, taxes.",
      "The main measure anticipated is a further freeze in the levels at which earners pay Britain's different tax levels, meaning as wages rise more people fall into higher tax brackets. Other potential changes include a mansion tax on high-valued properties, changes to the capital tax regime and a cut to tax-free provisions for private pensions.",
      "The budget is a high-stakes moment for Reeves and Starmer, who is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The next election does not have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.",
      "But speculation is swirling about a potential challenge to Starmer's leadership from within his party, and analysts say a misfiring budget could add to the sense of crisis within the government.",

      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "In the 40 years since Marc Buoniconti, then a college football linebacker at the Citadel, was paralyzed during a routine tackle, they have been told countless times that it was a problem that couldn\u2019t be fixed. The Buonicontis didn\u2019t listen.",
      "Instead, through the fund that bears their name, they have helped raise more than $550 million for The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and improved the lives of millions with spinal cord and brain injuries.",
      "\u201cThe Buoniconti Fund has lasted because we\u2019re relentless,\u201d Marc Buoniconti recently told The Associated Press. \u201cWe never give up. When we see a challenge, we face it head-on and don\u2019t stop until we find a solution. It\u2019s that determination, that refusal to quit that\u2019s kept us going all these years.\u201d",
      "That drive has also led The Miami Project to expand its work beyond curing paralysis. Its research center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine now also studies neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it is testing the brain-computer interface implant from Elon Musk\u2019s technology company Neuralink.",
      "Dr. Barth A. Green, chairman of The Miami Project, who co-founded the organization in 1985 with Nick Buoniconti, says the most surprising developments from the center have been the broadest ones.",
      "\u201cEvery operating room in the world that puts people to sleep monitors their nervous system for safety,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cThat was all developed at The Miami Project.\u201d",
      "Therapeutic hypothermia, where the body is cooled after an injury to protect the brain and spinal cord, is another widely used treatment developed at the center.",
      "Dr. Green said that before Buoniconti\u2019s accident he had been working on helping those who had been paralyzed for 20 years. Yet there wasn\u2019t a hub for that work until The Miami Project was established.",
      "It provided a home for him and \u201cthousands of scientists and researchers in Miami and around the world, who were equally engaged by the opportunity to change people\u2019s everyday quality of life and their opportunities to have more function and a better opportunity to be mobile and do things they never dreamt they could before.\u201d",
      "Miami Project Scientific Director W. Dalton Dietrich III said gathering those people from a variety of disciplines \u2013 neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers \u2013 into one building has led to unexpected advances.",
      "\u201cNot one particular treatment is going to cure paralysis,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to look at other disciplines to bring into the project to help us achieve that goal.\u201d",
      "One new, multidisciplinary area, neuromodulation, is \u201csomething we never thought about five years ago,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an exciting area where you can stimulate these residual circuits after brain injury or spinal cord injury in patients and they start moving their limbs.\u201d",

We\u2019ll give so many people their lives back. That\u2019s what keeps me going, and that\u2019s what makes every struggle to this point worth it.\u201d",

      "The investigators at SentinelOne stopped short of attributing the attack to the Russian government but noted that the operation targeted groups working on Ukrainian assistance and required six months to plan. The \u201chighly capable adversary\u201d behind the campaign, the investigators determined, is \u201can operator well-versed in both offensive tradecraft and defensive detection evasion.\u201d",

      "A federal judge called out an immigration enforcement agent for using artificial intelligence to write the narrative of a use-of-force report as just a small part of a scathing opinion that rebutted federal officials' narratives about appropriate force...",
      "Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines the agents\u2019 credibility and \u201cmay explain the inaccuracy of these reports.\u201d She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief sentence of description and several images.",
      "The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer\u2019s specific perspective without using an officer\u2019s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.",
      "Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn't meet that challenge.",
      "\u201cWhat this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures \u2014 if that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario,\u201d said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence through the Council for Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.",
      "Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the specific officer in that specific scenario.",
      "\u201cWe need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you\u2019re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.\u201d",
      "Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy concerns.",
      "Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn't understand he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.",
      "Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it\u2019s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it\u2019s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used and in some cases mistakes being made to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.",

      "\u201cYou would rather do things the other way around, where you understand the risks and develop guardrails around the risks,\u201d Kinsey said. \u201cEven if they aren\u2019t studying best practices, there\u2019s some lower hanging fruit that could help. We can start from transparency.\u201d",
      "Kinsey said while federal law enforcement considers how the technology should be used or not used, it could adopt a policy like those put in place in Utah or California recently, where police reports or communications written using AI have to be labeled.",
      "The photographs the officer used to generate a narrative also caused accuracy concerns for some experts.",
      "Well-known tech companies like Axon have begun offering AI components with their body cameras to assist in writing incident reports. Those AI programs marketed to police operate on a closed system and largely limit themselves to using audio from body cameras to produce narratives because the companies have said programs that attempt to use visuals are not effective enough for use.",
      "\u201cThere are many different ways to describe a color, or a facial expression or any visual component. You could ask any AI expert and they would tell you prompts return very different results between different AI applications, and that gets complicated with a visual component,\u201d said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.",
      "\u201cThere's also a professionalism questions. Are we OK with police officers using predictive analytics?\" he added. \"It\u2019s about what the model thinks should have happened, but might not be what actually happened.

      "As daily cannabis use rises to historic levels in the U.S., some longtime users are finding it harder to quit",
      "BROOKLINE, Mass. -- For the past several years, 75-year-old Miguel Laboy has smoked a joint with his coffee every morning. He tells himself he won\u2019t start tomorrow the same way, but he usually does.",
      "\u201cYou know what bothers me? To have cannabis on my mind the first thing in the morning,\u201d he said, sparking a blunt in his Brookline, Mass., apartment. \u201cI\u2019d like to get up one day and not smoke. But you see how that\u2019s going.\u201d",
      "Since legalization and commercialization, daily cannabis use has become a defining \u2014 and often invisible \u2014 part of many people\u2019s lives. High-potency vapes and concentrates now dominate the market, and doctors say they can blur the line between relief and dependence over time so that users don\u2019t notice the shift. Across the country, people who turned to cannabis for help are finding it harder to put down.",
      "Overall, alcohol remains more widely used than cannabis. But starting in 2022, the number of daily cannabis users in the U.S. surpassed that of daily drinkers \u2014 a major shift in American habits.",
      "Researchers say the rise has unfolded alongside products that contain far more THC than the marijuana of past decades, including vape oils and concentrates that can reach 80% to 95% THC. Massachusetts, like most states, sets no limit on how strong these products can be.",
      "Doctors warn that daily, high-potency use can cloud memory, disturb sleep, intensify anxiety or depression and trigger addiction in ways earlier generations didn\u2019t encounter. Many who develop cannabis use disorder say it\u2019s hard to recognize the signs because of the widespread belief that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive. Because the consequences tend to creep in gradually \u2014 brain fog, irritability, dependence \u2014 users often miss when therapeutic use shifts into compulsion.",
      "Laboy, a retired chef, began seeing a substance-use counselor after telling his doctor he felt depressed, unmotivated and increasingly isolated as his drinking and cannabis use escalated.",
      "Naltrexone helped him quit alcohol, but he hasn\u2019t found a way to quit marijuana. Unlike alcohol and opioids, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat cannabis addiction, though research is underway.",
      "Laboy, who first smoked at 18, said marijuana has long soothed symptoms tied to undiagnosed ADHD, childhood trauma and painful experiences \u2014 including cancer treatment and his son's death. Through decades in restaurant kitchens, he considered himself a \u201cfunctional pothead.\u201d",
      "Lately, though, his use has become compulsive. After retiring, he began vaping 85% THC cartridges.",
      "\u201cThese days, I carry two things in my hands: my vape and my cellular \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
      "Cannabis eases his anxiety and \u201csettles his spirit,\u201d but he\u2019s noticed it affects his concentration. He hopes to learn to read music, but sustaining focus at the piano has grown difficult.",
      "He\u2019s seen an addiction psychiatrist for six months, but he hasn\u2019t been able to cut back. The medical system doesn\u2019t seem equipped to help, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d Laboy said. \u201cI go to them for help, but all they say is, \u2018Try to smoke less.\u2019 I already know that \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m there.\u201d",

      "In the Allston apartment he shares with fraternity brothers, they have a communal bong.",
      "When he\u2019s high, Kyle feels calm \u2014 and able to process anxious thoughts and feel a sense of gratitude. But that clarity has become harder to reach when he\u2019s sober.",

      "Online, that realization unfolds daily on r/leaves, a Reddit community of more than 380,000 people trying to cut back or quit.",

      "Dr. Jordan Tishler, a former emergency physician who now treats medical cannabis patients in Massachusetts, said low doses of THC paired with high doses of CBD can help some patients with anxiety. Many products have high levels of THC, which can worsen symptoms, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be useful, but it can also be dangerous \u2014 and access without guidance is dangerous.\u201d",
      "Dr. Kevin Hill, an addiction director at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who specializes in cannabis use disorder, said the biggest gap is education, among both consumers and clinicians.",
      "\u201cI think adults should be allowed to do what they want as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt anybody else,\u201d but many users don't understand the risks, Hill said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Washington has relaunched his contempt probe of the Trump administration for failing to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March",
      "Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants out of the U.S. were midair on March 15 when a federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to turn them around.",
      "Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off an extraordinary power struggle between the judicial and executive branches of the U.S. government over what happened and why the judge's order went unexecuted.",
      "That fight entered a critical phase on Friday when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg relaunched an investigation to determine whether the Republican administration deliberately ignored his instruction, letting the planes continue onto El Salvador.",
      "The judge previously concluded it did and threatened to have the responsible official or officials prosecuted on a contempt charge. The administration has denied any violation.",
      "But an appeals court threw Boasberg's decision out. The contempt probe appeared dead until in yet another twist, a larger panel of judges on the same appeals court ruled on November 14 that the investigation could proceed.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what makes this case unusual and what could happen now:",
      "They are a last resort, former federal judges Jeremy Fogel and Liam O'Grady told The Associated Press in an interview Monday conducted on Zoom.",
      "\u201cThe judge has to believe that some line may have been crossed that you can\u2019t ignore,\u201d said Fogel, who spent 20 years on the bench in Northern California before retiring in 2018.",
      "Fogel said the issues raised by Boasberg's contempt probe \u2014 whether the migrants were deprived of their due process rights and whether the court's authority was flouted \u2014 meet that standard.",
      "\u201cWhatever actually happened, I think it would be very hard for him to just let it go,\u201d the judge said.",
      "O'Grady, who served in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, for 16 years, credited Boasberg for his efforts to determine the facts.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s making sure that his record is absolutely clear,\u201d O'Grady said.",
      "On Friday, Boasberg ordered the administration to submit declarations by December 5 from all officials involved in the decision not to return the flights to the U.S. He said he will then decide whether to seek testimony from witnesses.",
      "The declarations should detail the officials' roles in the decision, the judge said in the brief order.",
      "Justice Department attorneys had urged him to abandon the probe, but Boasberg said he must determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or anyone else \u201cshould be referred for potential contempt prosecution.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn other words, the Court must decide if: (1) the court order was \u2018clear and reasonably specific\u2019; (2) \u2018the defendant violated the order\u2019; and (3) \u2018the violation was willful,\u2019\u201d he wrote.",
      "In a court filing on Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys said Noem decided the migrants aboard the flights could be transferred to El Salvador after receiving advice from the Homeland Security department\u2019s acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara.",

      "The judge\u2019s directive to return them was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in the court filing on Tuesday.",
      "That order blocked the administration from removing \u201cany of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,\u201d but said nothing about the flights already airborne.",
      "The two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been \u201cremoved\u201d and therefore fell outside of the court's order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, the Government maintains that its actions did not violate the Court\u2019s order \u2014 certainly not with the clarity required for criminal contempt \u2014 and no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate,\u201d they wrote.",
      "A federal appeals court judge said in August that the administration's interpretation of Boasberg's order was plausible. The order \u201ccould reasonably have been read\u201d as only prohibiting the government from \u201cexpelling detainees from United States territory,\u201d wrote Gregory Katsas, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Katsas was appointed by President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump officials have chafed at judicial oversight and repeatedly contested the power of judges to review executive branch policies, particularly on immigration.",
      "\u201cThere is a deliberate effort to push the boundaries and try to curtail the authority of trial courts,\u201d said David Noll, a Rutgers Law School professor who writes about the intersection of the law and politics.",
      "Noll said he expects the Justice Department to fight the inquiry from the start, with \u201clots of appeals and chest thumping\u201d that Boasberg is exceeding his authority.",
      "Trump has already attacked Boasberg. After the March 15 ruling, Trump derided the judge as a \u201ctroublemaker and agitator\u201d and called for his impeachment. Boasberg was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama and currently serves as the chief judge of the federal court for the District of Columbia.",
      "In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct claim against him, alleging he told Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges in March that the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings.",
      "Boasberg has framed the contempt inquiry as an effort to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which he says requires compliance with judicial orders. Separately, he is considering a request to require the administration to give at least 137 of the migrants, who are now back in Venezuela, a chance to challenge their gang designation.",
      "He has accused Trump administration officials of rushing the migrants out of the U.S. and said significant evidence had surfaced indicating that many of them were not connected to the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "But history shows such punishments are rarely issued or allowed to stand against the government.",
      "A survey of thousands of federal court opinions published in the Harvard Law Review in 2018 turned up 82 contempt findings against government officials and agencies since the end of World War II. Judges issued or tried to issue fines in 16 of those cases, but higher courts blocked them in all but three.",
      "Prison time is even more uncommon. Judges locked up or credibly threatened to lock up a federal agency official in only four of the cases, and high courts similarly intervened to block the sanction, the study by Yale Law School professor Nicholas Parrillo found.",
      "Noll, the Rutgers Law professor, said if the inquiry moves ahead, it could influence public debate about whether the administration can carry out its mass deportation policy legally.",
      "\u201cA lot of a district court's power just comes from the ability to get an issue in front of the public,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.",

The man applied for asylum during the Biden administration and was granted it this year under Trump, according to a group that assists with resettlement of Afghans who helped U.S. forces in their country.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is promising a stricter anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was charged in the shooting of two National Guard members",
      "The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was charged this week in the shooting of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.",
      "But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration\u2019s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.",
      "The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, \u201cwas vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cBut more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.\u201d",
      "Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that \"as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate \u2014 not just foreign intelligence and military personnel \u2014 but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.\u201d",
      "The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.",
      "Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.",
      "Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.",
      "Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal \u201cshould have never been allowed to come here,\u201d Trump called lax migration policies \u201cthe single greatest national security threat facing our nation,\u201d and Vice President JD Vance said Biden\u2019s policy was \u201copening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.\u201d",
      "That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would \"permanently pause all migration\u201d from a list of nearly 20 countries, \u201cterminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,\u201d and \u201cremove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.\u201d Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.",
      "\u201cThey are highlighting practices that were already going into place,\u201d said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.",
      "Flores said the system has worked across administrations: \u201cYou may hear people say, \u2018Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump\u2019s problem.\u2019 That\u2019s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.\u201d",

      "This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.",
      "Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to the AP on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.",
      "\u201cLife was finally getting easier for me. I\u2019ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they\u2019re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.\u201d",
      "Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.",
      "Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.",
      "He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an \u201cextremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,\u201d he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.",
      "\u201cIt seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,\u201d he added.",

      "Leo recalled that three bridges span the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul linking East and West. He said Turkish Catholics, too, should form \u201cbonds of unity\u201d on three levels: with other Catholics, other Christians, and people of other faiths.",
      "The Mass was being celebrated in the Volkswagen Arena, which can seat more than 4,500 people. It came on the penultimate day of Leo\u2019s maiden trip. On Sunday he leaves for Beirut.",
      "Crowds continued to gather outside Istanbul\u2019s VW Arena on Saturday, where Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to lead Mass despite the rain.",

      "Her friend, Rodrick Nuel, originally from Nigeria\u2019s Biafra region but now living in northern Cyprus, said the papal visit sent a powerful message for the global Christian community. \u201cAlso, as Turkey is 99.9% Muslim and just 0.1% Christian, it shows the pope is reaching out to other religions as well.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Black Friday bargains no longer tempt people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs. Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.",
      "But the sales event still has enough enthusiasts to make the day after Thanksgiving the one when U.S. stores get the most shoppers coming in the door. For that reason, Black Friday still rules as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.",
      "This year's kickoff comes as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.",
      "Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect.",

      "While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the volatility of President Donald Trump \u2019s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods.

      "THC-infused drinks and snacks have soared in popularity as alcohol sales have declined in recent years",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. \u201cRope, not dope\u201d was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.",
      "But the way that law defined hemp \u2014 as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 \u2014 opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery\u2019s taproom.",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cIt will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIndustrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.\u201d",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Florida -- President Donald Trump said that one of the two West Virginia National Guard members shot by an Afghan national near the White House had died, calling the shooter who had worked with the CIA in his native country a \u201csavage monster.\u201d",
      "As part of his Thanksgiving call to U.S. troops, Trump said that he had just learned that Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, had died, while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was \u201cfighting for his life.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just passed away,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s no longer with us. She\u2019s looking down at us right now. Her parents are with her.\u201d",
      "The president called Beckstrom an \u201cincredible person, outstanding in every single way.\u201d",
      "Trump used the announcement to say the shooting was a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d as he criticized the Biden administration for enabling Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the Afghanistan War to enter the U.S. The president has deployed National Guard members in part to assist in his administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts.",
      "Trump suggested that the shooter was mentally unstable after the war and departure from Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cHe went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt happens too often with these people.\"",
      "The suspect charged with the shooting is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29. The suspect had worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before emigrating from Afghanistan, according to two sources who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, and #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the two-decade war.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, declined to provide a motive for Wednesday afternoon\u2019s brazen act of violence which occurred just blocks from the White House. The presence of troops in the nation\u2019s capital and other cities around the country has become a political flashpoint.",
      "The Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Webster Springs, where Beckstrom is from, will hold three prayer vigils Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, according to a Facebook post from the Webster County Veterans Auxiliary.",
      "Pirro said that the suspect, Lakanwal, launched an \u201cambush-style\u201d attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. The suspect currently faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Pirro said that \u201cit\u2019s too soon to say\u201d what the suspect\u2019s motives were.",
      "The charges could be upgraded, Pirro said, adding: \u201cWe are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree. But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge.\u201d",
      "The rare shooting of National Guard members on American soil, on the eve of Thanksgiving, comes amid court fights and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration\u2019s use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem.",
      "Trump issued an emergency order in August that federalized the local police force and sent in National Guard troops. The order expired a month later. But the troops have remained in the city, where nearly 2,200 troops currently are assigned, according to the government\u2019s latest update.",
      "The guard members have patrolled neighborhoods, train stations and other locations, participated in highway checkpoints and been assigned to pick up trash and guard sports events. The Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington following Wednesday\u2019s shooting.",
      "The suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.",
      "A resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal\u2019s cousin said Lakanwal was originally from the province and that he and his brother had worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as Zero Units in the southern province of Kandahar. A former official from the unit, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Lakanwal was a team leader and his brother was a platoon leader.",

      "Black Friday may no longer be the retail bacchanalia of years past, but the event still has enough enthusiasts to make it the biggest single shopping day in the U.S.",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Black Friday may no longer be the retail bacchanalia of years past, when the promise of one-time bargains caused people to leave Thanksgiving tables for malls where some customers got into fistfights over toys or TVs. But the event still has enough enthusiasts to make it the biggest shopping day in the U.S.",
      "For that reason, the day retains its crown as the official start of the holiday shopping season. This year's kickoff comes as companies navigate an uncertain economic environment and wrestle with the volatility of President Donald Trump 's wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods.",
      "Many have absorbed some of the costs and pulled back on hiring instead of raising prices for customers. Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month to the lowest since April \u2014 when Trump announced his tariffs \u2014 in the aftermath of the government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.",
      "Shoppers nonetheless have remained resilient and willing to spend, at least judging by the solid quarterly sales reports from Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. But many retail executives also say customers are focusing on deals and have been selective in what they're buying.",
      "Aron Boxer, 50, from Greenwich, Connecticut, said he delayed buying a car this year amid worries about tariffs. He said he'll be looking for deals on toys on Cyber Monday but is also willing to wait to the end for the best discount.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs definitely are not behind me, and I am concerned about it,\" the founder of an educational services company and a life coaching service said. \u201cI did consider buying earlier this year, but I feel like some people made some pretty bad business decisions anticipating tariffs to have a bigger impact than they did.\u201d",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,\" said Jill Renslow, chief business development and marketing officer at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which plans to give gift cards and other giveaways to the first 250 customers who show up at 7 a.m. on Friday. \u201cThe last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.\u201d",
      "Mall traffic heading into Black Friday surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, Renslow said.",
      "A forecast from the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, predicted a healthy increase in holiday sales. The group estimated that shoppers would collectively spend between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion in November and December, or 3.7% to 4.2% more than last year.",

      "Tariffs have played a role in stores' merchandising and pricing strategies. Many retailers accelerated shipments of some holiday merchandise before the tariffs took effect while also absorbing some of the extra import costs. But stores still have passed on some of the expense for items like toys, which are largely sourced in China.",
      "Market research firm Circana's retail tracking service examined various subcategories of general merchandise and found 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year.",
      "Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit. For example, 83% of toys sold in September saw an increase of at least 5%, Circana said.",
      "That number was up from 32% in June and will go even higher in coming months, according to Marshal Cohen, the firm\u2019s chief industry advisor.",
      "Some executives have noticed retailers advertising tamer holiday discounts. Mall of America\u2019s Renslow said deals didn't show up at the mall as early as she anticipated. But she estimated store tenants had ramped up this week with discounts in the range of 30% to 50%. She thinks they'll likely go deeper for the weekend.",
      "Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, which operates 85 shopping properties, also noted unimpressive holiday discounting.",
      "\u201cI think one of the benefits of the tariffs or the silver lining is that the inventory levels for the retailers are leaner, and they've tried to allow themselves to keep pricing power,\u201d he said.",

It both has a disturbing human rights record and is a legitimately valuable American partner in countering Iran\u2019s aggressions and building a more stable Middle East.",
      "But working with imperfect partners does not mean that the United States should cover up and lie about their misdeeds, as President Trump did when receiving Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, in the Oval Office on Tuesday. It was a fawning, cringe-worthy performance that belied America\u2019s more powerful status. It was absolution rather than realpolitik.",
      "Mr. Trump embraced the prince\u2019s implausible claim of innocence in the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and journalist, and berated Mary Bruce, of ABC News, for asking about the killing. The C.I.A. has concluded that the crown prince almost certainly ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the prince who was living in self-imposed exile in the United States and was murdered while visiting a Saudi consulate in Turkey. A United Nations investigator and a coalition of nongovernmental organizations reached similar conclusions.",
      "These inquiries noted that Saudi officials offered conflicting accounts of the killing and concealed information about it. Eventually, the kingdom investigated several members of Prince Mohammed\u2019s inner circle for the killing.",
      "The president\u2019s performance was alarming for three main reasons. One, it suggested that the truth was irrelevant, and it discarded the hard work of American intelligence in trying to determine that truth. It continued a long pattern of Mr. Trump lying when it suits his interests.",
      "Two, he whitewashed a brutal human-rights violation \u2014 a killing by strangulation, followed by the dismembering and disposal of the body, committed by a team of Saudi operatives. The United States does not have the power to rid the world of human-rights abuses. At its best, though, this country has successfully nudged allies toward better behavior. Mr. Trump, by contrast, signaled this week that foreign despots can eliminate bothersome critics without worry of American disapproval.",
      "Three, the president showed open disdain for the principles of press freedom enshrined in the Constitution. Traditionally, foreign leaders who visit the White House understand that they will not be able to avoid hard questions, as authoritarian leaders can at home. Ms. Bruce, the ABC correspondent, lived up to this tradition with a two-part question about the Trump family\u2019s business dealings in Saudi Arabia and the prince\u2019s role in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.",
      "Mr. Trump unpersuasively waved away his conflicts of interest before demeaning Mr. Khashoggi \u2014 \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about\u201d \u2014 and defending Prince Mohammed. \u201cHe knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.\u201d",
      "The role of the news media in our democracy is not to flatter foreign leaders or, for that matter, American ones. It is to pose important and sometimes challenging questions and publish the facts. As president, Mr. Trump repeatedly shows contempt for this principle. Over the past week alone, he called Ms. Bruce \u201ca terrible person\u201d and told another female reporter, \u201cQuiet, piggy.\u201d His behavior suggests that he would prefer an American news media that behaves more like Saudi Arabia\u2019s largely muzzled and obsequious media.",
      "The prince is a complicated dictator. He has pushed his country to become more modern and open in important ways, including by expanding women\u2019s rights, reducing the influence of religious hard-liners and diversifying the economy. He also remains an authoritarian.

      "The Washington Post says Trump's immigration policies are over the top",
      "The Trump administration has named New York City the next target in its deportation tour. White House border czar Tom Homan revealed last week he is planning a widespread dragnet across the Big Apple \u201cin the near future,\u201d in addition to enforcement sweeps already happening.",
      "The administration sees this as the obvious next step in its pressure campaign against \u201csanctuary\u201d policies in blue cities and states. But these actions are not without cost. In fact, the administration\u2019s mass deportation campaign is already backfiring.",
      "Securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes are some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most popular policies. The latter has support among 79 percent of Americans \u2014 including 69 percent of Democrats \u2014 in the latest Harvard-Harris poll. Despite this, approval for Trump\u2019s immigration agenda has dropped nine points since February.",
      "The president\u2019s over-the-top approach to deportations is almost certainly the reason why. While Homan has vowed to prioritize going after the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d the administration has rounded up more than just hardened criminals. Americans can see the difference between carting off a rapist and deporting the neighborhood gardener who pays taxes.",
      "The Trump administration blames \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d \u2014 picking up people who weren\u2019t the target of an operation \u2014 on sanctuary policies. Todd M. Lyons, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said they wouldn\u2019t feel compelled to be so aggressive if localities willingly turned over \u201cviolent criminal aliens.\u201d",
      "Lyons raised a valid public safety concern. Some progressive states and cities limit local law enforcements\u2019 ability to honor ICE detainers, or requests for law enforcement to hold people past their release date, unless a serious crime has been committed. And some cities, such as New York, require a conviction for a serious crime or a judicial warrant. Sanctuary jurisdictions often argue that holding someone for a civil ICE detainer amounts to unlawful detention. This means that some migrants with criminal charges have been released back into the community in defiance of a detainer.",
      "It\u2019s reasonable to debate how local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE to track down potentially dangerous criminals. But that isn\u2019t an excuse for the government to round up just anyone, nor is it a particularly effective way to convince moderates to rethink sanctuary policies. \u201cBringing hell\u201d to Boston, as Homan promised to cheers at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, hasn\u2019t gotten Massachusetts to change its policy on honoring ICE detainers, but it did make Boston\u2019s defiant mayor, Michelle Wu, a progressive hero. Some states, such as Colorado, have even strengthened their sanctuary laws since Trump took office.",
      "Meanwhile, mass deportations \u2014 and Trump\u2019s broader anti-immigration policies \u2014 are threatening key industries like construction and agriculture. In October, Trump\u2019s own Labor Department released a document that \u201cthe near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce\u201d is disrupting production costs and \u201cthreatening the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers. \u201dFor a moment, Trump seemed to understand this, briefly directing immigration officers in June to stop arresting agriculture and hospitality workers before reversing that policy a week later.",
      "New Yorkers have already been through a roller-coaster of immigration policies. In 2022, Republican governors in border states bused migrants to the city to test the sincerity of its sanctuary laws. In time, Mayor Eric Adams (D), once a defender of those laws, changed his tune. In April, his administration issued an executive order allowing ICE into New York\u2019s Rikers Island prison complex to investigate transnational gang members, just days after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the mayor. His order was blocked in September by the New York State Supreme Court because of an \u201cimpermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d",
      "At his chummy news conference with Trump on Friday, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said New York\u2019s laws allow the city to coordinate with ICE on some serious crimes, but that these have \u201cvery little to do\u201d with the deportation of women and children whose only crime is being in the country illegally. Some members of the Trump administration don\u2019t care about that distinction, but the American people seem to.",

      "The Wall Street Journal on what Trump's latest peace offering means for Russia and Ukraine",
      "The Trump Administration is making another run at ending the war in Ukraine, and a lasting peace with honor would be a laudable achievement. But for three years the only peace on offer has been Ukraine\u2019s surrender, and the latest American offer\u2014really, an ultimatum\u2014is merely another dressed-up version.",
      "The 28-point plan that was mooted in the press but became public on Thursday includes a reduction in Ukraine\u2019s military and a cap on its manpower at 600,000, from about 900,000 now. It isn\u2019t clear if foreign peace-keeping troops would be allowed on Ukraine\u2019s soil or if it could maintain long-range weapons.",
      "The deal hands Mr. Putin all of the Donbas in the east. He\u2019d pocket the territory he\u2019s already seized there\u2014and get the rest that Ukraine still holds despite nearly four years of Russian assaults.",
      "Ukraine would forfeit its right to join a defensive Western alliance in NATO. Oh\u2014and the U.S. and Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea, which Mr. Putin took by force in 2014. Mr. Putin has made these demands since 2022 after his failed storming of Kyiv.",
      "This managed capitulation would be a bitter pill in Ukraine. \u201cNow is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\u201d Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday. Ukraine must choose between \u201cdignity, or the risk of losing a key partner.\u201d",
      "That bracing remark underscores that Mr. Trump is essentially saying Ukraine must agree to his terms or he will stop U.S. weapons and intelligence support. Mr. Zelensky is in a weakened domestic position amid the embarrassment of a fresh corruption scandal in Kyiv. But after Mr. Putin\u2019s brutalities, it will be hard for any Ukrainian patriot to sell this settlement to the Ukrainian public.",

The deal looks like an echo of Trump\u2019s first term freeze out of the Afghan government while Zalmay Khalilzad negotiated with the Taliban in Doha. That set the stage for President Biden\u2019s abandonment of Afghanistan.",
      "Mr. Trump may figure he can finally wash his hands of Ukraine if Europe and Ukraine reject his offer. He\u2019s clearly sick of dealing with the war. But appeasing Mr. Putin would haunt the rest of his Presidency. If Mr. Trump thinks American voters hate war, wait until he learns how much they hate dishonor.",
      "Mr. Trump can tarnish his legacy if he wants, but the bigger risk here is to the United States. A bad deal in Ukraine would broadcast to U.S. enemies that they can seize what they want with force or nuclear blackmail or by pressing on until America loses interest. The odds of a Pacific crisis will go up.",

      "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch hope the GOPs defiance Trump on Epstein files is an indicator of things to come",
      "America doesn\u2019t yet know, and will probably never know, what if any role Donald Trump played in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sick world of child sex trafficking. Whatever this president says, there\u2019s zero chance that his compliant Justice Department will allow anything damning or even unflattering about him to emerge when they finally release the long-awaited, heavily redacted Epstein files.",
      "What we have learned, however, is that Trump doesn\u2019t always, in every instance, hold similar sway over the usually subservient Republicans who control Congress. On this issue, the GOP lapdogs rebelled, making clear they were ready to defy Trump\u2019s resistance to releasing the files \u2014 to the point that he finally had to lurch to the head of that parade and pretend he was leading it, lest he get trampled by it.",
      "Which raises an encouraging question: If congressional Republicans can finally find the grit to actually carry out their duty of checking presidential power on this one issue, might there theoretically be others? After all, on topics ranging from tariffs to government service cuts to domestic militarization, Trump\u2019s rogue policies are burdening their constituents in ways far more relevant than a dead pedophile.",
      "Epstein, of course, was the wealthy financier who hung himself in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors in New York and Florida. His long history of hobnobbing with powerful people \u2014 including Trump and former President Bill Clinton \u2014 made revelations of his twisted double life politically explosive.",
      "Trump himself helped light that fuse with his usual reckless conspiracy-mongering, such as retweeting an allegation shortly after Epstein\u2019s death that Epstein \u201chad information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead.\u201d",
      "It was largely Trump\u2019s drumbeat on the issue, starting in his first presidential term, that convinced his MAGA movement to treat the release of the Epstein files as a holy quest. Which made it all the more interesting that, in his current term, Trump did an about-face and became the chief obstructionist to that crusade.",
      "This cannot be said emphatically enough: Through the entire Epstein saga this year, Trump has always had the authority to simply order all the Epstein records in the federal government\u2019s possession released. Yet it took the recent action by Congress to force the issue.",
      "Before those bipartisan, nearly unanimous congressional votes in the past week, Trump and his people, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, had been trying to douse the issue, claiming (in a reversal of their own previous claims) that the much-speculated-upon Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d of fellow pedophiles didn\u2019t actually exist.",
      "It wasn\u2019t the only suspicious movement by the administration. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s imprisoned co-conspirator, was recently moved to a lighter-security facility, allegedly is getting preferential treatment there, and is reportedly preparing to petition Trump for clemency.",
      "At the same time, multiple media outlets have reported that the Justice Department has been scouring hundreds of thousands of Epstein documents on orders to redact any mention of Trump. Trump himself, with a typically ham-handed diversionary tactic, is again regurgitating unsupported claims that Clinton has been implicated.",
      "None of this should be taken as evidence of criminality by Trump. We all know his fragile ego and bottomless self-regard well enough to consider that he was merely trying to avoid embarrassing accounts of his time as an Epstein insider.",
      "In any case, Trump had lobbied for months to prevent congressional Republicans from taking up legislation to force release of the files, dismissing as a \u201cDemocrat hoax\u201d the very conspiracies he used to promote.",
      "It was only when it became clear that congressional Republicans were on a path to defy him anyway and demand the files that Trump again pirouetted and publicly backed the legislation. He subsequently signed the bill sent to him.",
      "Again, we\u2019re not holding our breath (and no one should) for evidence implicating Trump in Epstein\u2019s crimes. If that evidence exists, it won\u2019t see the light of day regardless of the legislation. This we know because we know Trump and we know his administration.",
      "But now we also know that congressional Republicans are, when properly motivated by public opinion, capable of pulling on their big-boy pants and doing their jobs.",
      "As Americans of every political persuasion watch their president driving up prices with spastic, rogue tariff policies, violating the Constitution left and right with unauthorized spending cuts and personal enrichment, scuttling due process and the rule of law, militarizing our streets, and threatening the American project in so many other ways \u2014 all while Congress generally sits by, whistling \u2014 here\u2019s hoping they take this as a lesson in the politics of the possible.",

      "The Guardian on the destruction in Gaza",
      "The declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza in October brought initial relief to its inhabitants. Yet officials there said Israeli strikes killed 33 people, including 12 children, on Wednesday; Israel said its troops had come under fire. Another five Palestinians were killed on Thursday. Hundreds have died since the ceasefire was declared. Even if the shelling stops, the destruction of Palestinian life will carry on as Israel continues to throttle aid, and the consequences of two years of war unfold. The World Health Organization warned last month that the health catastrophe would last for generations.",
      "Food remains in short supply. While displaced families shiver in flooded makeshift shelters, with many facing a third winter of homelessness, aid organisations say they cannot deliver stockpiles of tents and tarpaulins. Israel, which denies blocking aid, has designated tent poles as \u201cdual-use\u201d items that could potentially be used for a military purpose. Save the Children reports children sleeping on bare ground in sewage-soaked clothing.",
      "The Guardian last week revealed US plans for the long-term division of Gaza into a \u201cgreen zone\u201d under Israeli and international control, to be redeveloped, and a \u201cred zone\u201d left in ruins; a US official described reunion of the strip as \u201caspirational\u201d. This vision \u2013 with international troops essentially propping up Israeli occupation, and Palestinians drawn to those areas to escape squalor and chaos elsewhere \u2013 echoes disastrous US policies in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "This is the grim underpinning of the UN security council resolution this week, endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s peace proposals. The \u201cboard of peace\u201d looks like a colonial authority overseen by Mr Trump, and perhaps anchored by Tony Blair. Palestinian technocrats, somehow both domestically credible and acceptable to the US and Israel \u2013 a notable feat \u2013 would work beneath it. All this would be possible thanks to an international stabilisation force that the US hopes to see deployed by January. That would be a stretch even if countries prove truly willing to commit troops.",
      "The resolution improved on a draft text and won backing from the Arab world \u2013 and angry rejection from the Israeli right \u2013 by including references to a Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal. Yet those references are couched in the vaguest terms, as an unguaranteed reward for sufficiently good behaviour, rather than as a recognition of inalienable Palestinian rights. If all goes according to plan, \u201cconditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d. Israeli withdrawal would be based on standards and timeframes agreed by the military itself as well as the US and others. Countries have backed not what this text does mean but what it might conceivably mean or become.",
      "Some believe that this is the best that can be salvaged from current circumstances, given Mr Trump\u2019s presidency; others hope that it is just possible that this unpromising start could allow something better to be forged. But it is hard not to conclude that for some governments, this is more about conscience-salving and reputation-laundering than the best interests of Palestinians. Germany has already announced that it will resume weapons exports to Israel. For Palestinians, \u201cwhat looked like a forever war may be metamorphizing into forever misery\u201d, the political scientist Nathan Brown has warned. Countries that were complicit in a genocidal war have all the more duty to demand better.",

      "Trading turkeys \u2013 for wildlife management, not dinner \u2013 was a key part of one of North America\u2019s biggest conservation success stories. After dwindling to a few thousand birds in the late 1880s, the wild turkey population has grown to about 7 million birds in 49 states, plus more in Canada and Mexico, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation.",
      "In many cases, restoration relied on trades. The exchange rates varied, but Oklahoma once swapped walleye and prairie chickens for turkeys from Arkansas and Missouri. Colorado traded mountain goats for turkeys from Idaho. The Canadian province of Ontario ended up with 274 turkeys from New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, Missouri and Iowa in exchange for moose, river otters, and partridge.",

      "Wild turkeys were abundant across the U.S. until the mid-1800s, when the clearing of forestland and unregulated hunting led the population to plummet. Early restoration efforts in the 1940s and 50s involved raising turkeys on farms, but that didn\u2019t work well, Dorsey said.",

With careful management that included moving birds around the state dozens of times over the ensuing decades, the population has grown to roughly 40,000 birds, said Dan Ellingwood, a biologist with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. That\u2019s likely well beyond the expectations at the time of reintroduction, he said.",
      "\u201cTurkeys are incredibly adaptive,\u201d he said. \u201cWinter severity has changed, the landscape has changed, and yet the population really took off.\u201d",
      "Turkeys play an important role in a healthy ecosystem as both predator and prey, he said, and are a popular draw for hunters. But the restoration effort also is important just for the sake of ensuring native species continue to persist, he said.",
      "Dorsey, at the National Wild Turkey Federation agreed, noting that turkey restoration projects also helped states revive their populations of other species.",
      "\u201cA lot of good work gets done on the back of the wild turkey,\u201d she said.",

      "Turkey is a rare country that, with Leo\u2019s visit, can boast of having been visited by the five popes of the modern globe-trotting papacy: Paul VI in 1967, John Paul II in 1979 in one of the first trips of his pontificate, Benedict XVI in 2006 and Francis in 2014.",
      "Paul VI also visited Lebanon during a stopover en route to India in 1964, John Paul II visited Lebanon in 1997 and Benedict XVI in 2012, in the final foreign trip of his pontificate.

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 16:09:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

      "\"It's amazing, really,\" Lesley Ann Warren, the actor who portrays Miss Scarlet, told \"CBS Mornings\" about the movie's now cult classic status.",
      "The film explores the mystery of who killed Mr. Boddy, who had been blackmailing his dinner party guests. Warren is among the film's ensemble cast that includes Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd, Martin Mull, Michael McKean and Colleen Camp.",

      "But about a decade after the release of \"Clue,\" a new popularity emerged thanks in part to cable television and eventually streaming services.",
      "\"Martin Mull called me on the phone and said, 'Are you getting a lot of fan mail from 'Clue,' like a crazy amount of fan mail?'\" Warren said. \"And I was like, 'Yes, what's going on?'\"",

    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of COVID-19 vaccines, has been named second-in-command at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "While there has not been an official announcement about Abraham's role, a CDC spokesperson confirmed with CBS News Atlanta that he was listed in the Atlanta-based agency's address book as principal deputy director. A Health and Human Services spokesperson has also confirmed his appointment.",
      "Abraham, a 70-year-old former Republican congressman and doctor from rural northeast Louisiana, served three terms in the House of Representatives before losing his bid for governor in 2019. He was appointed surgeon general in December 2023.",
      "In February, Abraham ordered his staff to stop engaging in media campaigns and community health fairs to encourage vaccinations, saying in a memo that the Louisiana Department of Health \"will no longer promote mass vaccination.\" The announcement was made the same day that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to serve as President Trump's health secretary.",
      "In a letter posted on the Louisiana Department of Health's website, Abraham decried \"blanket government mandates\" for vaccines and criticized the CDC's COVID-19 vaccination push, saying individuals should make their own decisions about vaccinations.",
      "\"Government should admit the limitations of its role in people's lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,\" Abraham argued.",
      "Dr. Nirav Shah, an epidemiologist who served in the position under former President Biden's administration, criticized the appointment on X.",
      "\"Dr. Abraham has been on the wrong side of several important public health issues over the past decade,\" Shah wrote. \"His track record, which includes undermining confidence in vaccines and minimizing the risk of outbreaks, disqualifies him from steering an agency charged with protecting all Americans.\"",
      "Abraham's appointment comes as Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has intensified attacks on some components used in vaccinations. Earlier this month, a CDC webpage was\u00a0updated with language claiming that studies have not ruled out linking vaccines to the development of autism. Kennedy later told the\u00a0New York Times in an interview that he personally directed the agency to update the page.",
      "The CDC has remained without a permanent director since August, after Kennedy fired\u00a0Dr. Susan Monarez less than a month after the Senate confirmed her to lead the agency. Monarez testified in front of Congress in September that Kennedy had pressured her to change CDC guidance over childhood vaccinations.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

    "summary": "Shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday despite wider economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. It was a slight increase from the company's spending estimate of $11.7 billion.",
      "Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Mobile shopping was estimated to drive more than half of all sales, according to Adobe.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "In-store traffic continues to dwindle",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute - with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes - or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \"the story isn't just that shoppers stayed home; it's that they're changing how and when they shop,\" Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday. He explained that customers are now spreading out purchases over a longer time frame and \"walking into stores with a far narrower mission than we've seen in past holiday seasons.\"",
      "Black Friday remains a major date on retailers' calendar - and Shasteen added that Friday's drop is \"notably better\" than a sharper 6.2% decline RetailNext saw in in-store traffic for the days leading up to Thanksgiving. This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \"they're still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday - before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Tariffs create strain on businesses and households",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs\u00a0on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. The federal government had raised $195 billion in customs duties for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "Despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security - amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing - with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \"buy now, pay later\" plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-november-28/",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 15:36:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The S&amp;P 500 closed near its Oct. 28 record, buoyed by optimism that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next month.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.",
      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble\u00a0could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",
      "Treasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.",

      "Fake QR codes, phony social media posts and phishing emails are just some of the tools scammers use to lure consumers into unwittingly forking over their information.",
      "To pull off their schemes, fraudsters are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence. One common scam is creating \"deepfakes\" \u2014 videos that appear to be a celebrity or influencer promoting a product but are in fact a dupe \u2014 to bait people into visiting counterfeit websites. That means that what you see may not be what you get.",

      "Check the URL to make sure it's from a reputable retailer. Scammers often create fake websites that mirror other businesses' URLs.

With debit cards, the onus falls on you to get your money back, according to NerdWallet, a personal finance website. With credit cards, it's up to the card issuer to get the money back, meaning the consumer faces less legwork and an easier path to getting a refund. Whatever card you use, experts encourage shoppers to track their purchase history to make sure nothing is amiss.\u00a0Be skeptical of offers or discounts that seem too good to be true. Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce, told CBS News in an email that shoppers should verify offers directly on the retailer's web page.Read the fine print.\u00a0While it may be easy to skim over purchase details, experts encourage shoppers to give them some extra attention. Melanie McGovern, the director of public relations and social media at the nonprofit Better Business Bureau, told CBS News Texas that shoppers should check shipping dates, return policies and \u00a0restocking dates for sold-out items. \"Just doing general things before you make that purchase will help you to make sure you get the item before the holidays,\" she told CBS News Texas.Use the Better Business Bureau's Scam Tracker.\u00a0The tool lets you report scams and read those documented by other consumers, helping you avoid falling for the same tactics.Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages.\u00a0Scammers often send messages that appear to come from a legitimate company, urging you to take an action such as updating your payment information.

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

      "Discounts and deals abound around Thanksgiving, but other days may offer better prices for holiday shopping, according to retail experts.",
      "This year may be a mixed bag for discounts, as some business owners have told CBS News that rising costs are giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales. Still, holiday spending this year could top $1 trillion for the first time, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation, which expects roughly 187 million people to shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.",

      "Looking to buy a big appliance, like a refrigerator, washing machine, or kitchen appliance? It's best to shop in person at brick-and-mortar stores on Black Friday, according to Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, a provider of retail research.",
      "\"We expect to see lots of promotions that are unique to in-store purchases at retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers should also head to retailers early, because inventory could be limited. Additionally, she expects retailers to adjust pricing in real time, based on consumer demand. Promotions could even vary on a store-by-store basis, depending on inventory levels, Weinswig noted.",
      "When to find travel deals",
      "While the Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been dubbed \"Travel Tuesday,\" it's not necessarily the cheapest time to book. Instead, consumers should start looking for deals as early as Thursday evening, said Julian Kheel, founder of Points Path, a flight search engine.",

      "When to buy toys",
      "Black Friday will provide the lowest prices for popular kids' toys, according to retail analysts. It won't pay to wait later than that for deals, especially on hot items like Legos and Labubu dolls that tend to fly off shelves quickly, according to Pandya.",

      "Butler said his company has had to pass along some costs to consumers. He estimated that 85% of Americans still choose artificial Christmas trees over real ones, and said he's actively lobbying lawmakers to push for tariff relief. He says the price of an approximately $100 artificial tree has risen about $10 to $15 due to tariffs.",
      "\"We want to be treated the same as bananas, coffee, mangoes, etc.,\" Butler said, in reference to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this month that exempts products including beef, coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, cocoa and certain spices from the new tariffs. \"Those things are not grown in the U.S. We know that those are now being exempted. Our raw materials are not available in the U.S. And so we think we should be treated in the same way.\"",

      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",
      "AI's uses extend far beyond some of its most visible applications, such as writing computer code, the researchers note. Among the ways employers across different industries are using AI:",

      "The study analyzed workers' distinct skills and compared them to the abilities of more than 13,000 AI tools. In some cases, AI can augment human efforts, while in other types of work the technology is far more transformative, according to the researchers.",
      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",
      "AI is also already doing\u00a0some of the entry-level jobs\u00a0that have historically been reserved for recent college graduates or relatively inexperienced workers, the report notes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicare-drug-prices-15-medications-trump-biden-savings/",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

    "summary": "Aviation experts worry that the recent government shutdown could make it hard for the U.S. to recruit a new generation of air traffic controllers.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown highlighted a fragile link in the nation's aviation system: finding enough air traffic controllers to keep flights on schedule. The 43-day closure, during which controllers were required to work without pay, has only heightened that challenge.",
      "\"It's a good job with good benefits, but partisan fighting over appropriations is not an ideal situation to try to bring in new air traffic controllers and convince them that this is a good career field,\" Tim Kiefer, a retired air traffic controller who is now a professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CBS News. \"It's not a positive to try to bring people into this industry by saying, 'You never know if you're not going to get paid.'\"",
      "The shutdown saw a spike in the number of controllers choosing to retire, according to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. The spectacle could also scare away younger workers from entering the field, Kiefer said.",
      "\"If you are a brand new person looking to enter a career, you may be thinking twice if you have to worry whether you're going to be paid or not. That may be a deterrent, and they might find another job because of that,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Department of Transportation told CBS News that \"the failure to pay air traffic controllers for 44 days created uncertainty, drove many experienced controllers out of the profession and harmed the recruitment pipeline.\"",
      "\"No one wants to enter a job where their paycheck could be held hostage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. had roughly\u00a011,700\u00a0certified professional controllers and certified controllers in training, leaving the nation some 4,000 short of the FAA's target staffing level. The agency expects to hire at least 8,900 new air traffic controllers through 2028, while nearly 7,000 are projected to leave over the same period.",
      "The FAA hit its hiring target in 2025, bringing in 2,026 new air traffic controllers, according to the agency.",
      "\"This administration is working all avenues from increasing starting salaries for controllers to streamlining the hiring process to effectively bring about the Golden Age of Travel and ensure America has the safest airspace in the world,\" the Transportation Department spokesperson said.",
      "What are the qualifications?",
      "On the FAA's website, Duffy describes controlling air traffic as \"one of the best, most rewarding \u00a0jobs in America.\" He also highlighted \"the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies.\"",
      "Recruiting prospective air traffic controllers is one thing, but getting them to stick with the roughly four years of training required to be certified by the FAA is another matter, according to industry experts.",
      "\"The washout rate at various stages of the controller recruitment and training process is high,\" Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, told CBS News.",
      "Before someone qualifies to train at the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Academy in Oklahoma City, Okla., job candidates must undergo a rigorous application process. To even apply through USAJobs, the federal government's official employment site, they must meet the following criteria:",
      "Be a U.S. citizenBe under the age of 31Pass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipmentHave one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",

      "Speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment",
      "Have one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of at least one year of post-secondary education and work experience",
      "Aspiring controllers must also pass an exam that the FAA\u00a0says\u00a0predicts candidates' \"aptitude to be an air traffic controller.\" Within a week, they are notified if they have passed.",
      "Stephen Abraham, a retired air traffic controller formerly based at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, told CBS News that the aptitude exam weeds out many job candidates.",
      "\"It's an assessment that determines if you have the right mental makeup to be an air traffic controller,\" he said, noting that people can not prepare or study for the test. \"If you succeed, they send you to Oklahoma City for eight to 12 weeks, where your training is more tailored toward success.\"",
      "Candidates who pass the test must then undergo comprehensive medical and background checks before they begin training at the academy. The medical red flags include using certain types of contact lenses to correct their vision, which is automatically disqualifying, and abnormal blood pressure.",
      "According to the FAA, fewer than 10% of applicants meet the agency's requirements to work as an air traffic controller and gain admission to the training program.",
      "How much do controllers earn?",
      "Once enrolled at the Oklahoma City academy, students spend months learning the basics of controlling the nation's airspace, such as understanding where to position planes on tabletop models of airports, Abraham explained. As they progress, they start using simulators to practice managing air traffic.",
      "Other training focuses on how to communicate with pilots and other controllers assigned to different parts of the airspace, as well as how to determine the best flight routes based on changing weather conditions and other factors.",
      "In time, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility, typically a control tower at a small airport with lighter plane traffic, where they spend an additional two to four years working as controllers under the supervision of more experienced staff.",
      "Joining the FAA academy isn't the only path to becoming a controller. Candidates can instead attend a college that offers an FAA-certified curriculum, and then proceed directly to on-the-job training.",
      "In 2024 (the last year for which federal data is available), the median annual wage for air traffic controllers was $144,580, according\u00a0to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "But pay varies widely based on experience and location. Annual income for less experienced controllers at smaller airports is closer to $60,000, according to aviation experts. Abraham said controllers' pay can rise as they rise to working at busier facilities, gain experience and get promoted.",
      "\"A lot of people get to that point, and when they are at their first facility, trying to learn to control real traffic, some just don't make it,\" Poole said. \"It's more stressful than being a pilot, who flies a route from point A to B mostly on autopilot.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:49:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-1000-higher-2026-piper-sandler-obbba-big-beautiful-bill/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:44:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The impact of the Republicans' tax and spending law could result in the \"largest refund season of the last decade,\" a Wall Street report says.",
    "story": [
      "Federal tax refunds often represent a family's single largest check of the year, and next year's refunds could be even bigger, with the average payment set to increase by about $1,000 per filer, according to a recent analysis from financial services company Piper Sandler.",
      "That could boost the typical refund check to roughly $4,151 per filer, based on IRS data that shows the average tax refund was $3,151 for the 2025 tax filing season. Americans will file their 2025 individual returns in early 2026, with most people receiving their refunds within 21 days of submitting their forms to the tax agency.",
      "The analysis aligns with other forecasts predicting a bumper year for tax refunds, driven by the \"one big, beautiful\" tax and spending law signed by President Trump in July. The legislation enacted a bevy of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025, including eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "\"When people go to file, they'll be surprised by really, really large refunds,\" Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler and one of the report's authors, said in a recent podcast about the analysis. \"In a typical year, we might have about $270 billion in tax refunds, and it'll be that plus another $90 billion.\"",
      "Americans generally aren't adjusting their withholding to reflect the new law's retroactive tax cuts, largely because it's hard for employees to estimate the impact, Schneider added. As a result, when people file their taxes in early 2026, their refunds could be about one-third larger than usual \u2014 that amounts to roughly an extra $1,000 per filer, according to the report's calculations.",
      "\"It could be one of the largest tax refund seasons ever,\" Schneider added.",
      "Still, the impact won't be evenly distributed, with the benefits largely going toward middle- and upper-middle-income households, or those earning between $60,000 to $400,000 per year, according to Piper Sandler.",
      "That echoes earlier tax analyses projecting that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. People who earn over $217,000 a year are likely to get $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the law, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Some of the law's benefits won't reach the highest-earning households because of income phase-outs, Piper Sandler noted. For example, the new $40,000 SALT deduction begins to phase out for filers with annual income of more than $500,000.",
      "The lowest-earning households are also likely to see little benefit from parts of the new tax law. For instance, the higher SALT deduction cap only helps people whose state and local taxes exceed the 2025 standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples.",
      "Because filers must itemize to claim the SALT deduction, lower-income households typically can't take advantage of it, according to tax experts.",
      "\"This isn't going to the very bottom of the distribution. It isn't going to the very top of the distribution either,\" Scheider said.",

      "It belonged to Jean's godmother, Jeanne Baudot, a friend and student of Renoir's, who passed the painting on to her heirs.",
      "Believed to have been painted between 1890 and 1895, it features the artist's second son, who went on to become an Oscar-winning filmmaker, shown sitting with his nanny.",
      "Pascal Perrin, an art historian and Renoir expert, lauded the \"exceptional condition of the work, which has undergone no restoration,\" while presenting the canvas.",
      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is exceptional because, first of all, it is a masterclass of intimacy,\" auctioneer Christophe Joron-Derem told PBS. \"We see this very tender relationship between Jean and Gabrielle, who knows how to control the child so that Renoir can paint him.\"",

    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 09:25:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Aimee  Picchi",

      "Bystanders couldn't open the doors because the handles do not work from the outside because they also rely on battery power to operate.. The doors also couldn't be opened from inside because the battery had shut off because of the fire, and a manual override button is hard to find and use, the lawsuit alleges.",

      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A higher Medicare Part B premium in 2026 could erode next year's cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security recipients, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Aside from underlying health care inflation, Medicare's costs are also increasing because of increased demand for medical services, CMS said this month.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Workers with employee-sponsored coverage are also likely to see their costs climb\u00a0next year, with most expected to pay 6% to 7% more for their 2026 plans, according to an analysis from consultant Mercer.",

      "Venezuela said the U.S. has unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and seeks to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace,\" after President Donald Trump posted on social media that the country's airspace should be considered as \"closed in its entirety.\"",
      "In a statement released Saturday \u2014 in response to the message posted earlier by Mr. Trump \u2014 Venezuela's government demanded \"unrestricted respect\" for its airspace. \"Such statements constitute a hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act, incompatible with the most basic principles of international law, and are part of a permanent policy of aggression against our country,\" the Venezuelan government release read in part.",
      "Mr. Trump had said in a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0that all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers should consider the airspace \"above and surrounding\" the South American nation as \"closed in its entirety\" \u2014 an assertion that appeared to signal further\u00a0U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about Mr. Trump's post, and it was unclear whether he was announcing a new policy or simply reinforcing the messaging around his\u00a0campaign against Maduro, which has involved\u00a0multiple strikes\u00a0in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean on small boats accused of ferrying drugs as well as a\u00a0buildup of naval forces\u00a0in the region.",

      "\"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutionality has the power to interfere, block or condition the use of national airspace,\" the Venezuelan government said in its statement Saturday, citing ICAO rules.

    "summary": "The Trump administration on Friday directed officials to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "The move is the administration's latest effort to tighten the American immigration system after Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who was granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials earlier this year.",
      "Asylum officers at USCIS, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, were instructed to refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications received by the agency, according to the internal notice and sources, who requested anonymity to describe an action that has not been publicly announced.",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would start a review of asylum approvals under the Biden administration, citing the shooting of the two National Guard members, one of whom has died. The man accused of shooting the soldiers, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 during former President Joe Biden's presidency and was granted asylum this spring under the second Trump administration.",
      "The action relayed to USCIS asylum officers internally on Friday amounts to an indefinite pause on asylum adjudications for all nationalities. Asylum cases are filed by foreigners who claim they will suffer persecution if deported or returned to their home countries because of certain factors, including their race, nationality, religion or political views.",
      "\"Do not enter any decision information for affirmative cases,\" a USCIS notice to asylum officers in one office read, referring to asylum cases overseen by the agency. \"Defensive\" cases, the other type of asylum applications, are filed by those facing deportation and are decided by federal immigration judges at the Justice Department.",
      "Officers were told the pause applied to all USCIS asylum cases, including those filed by Afghans who arrived under a Biden administration resettlement effort dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome.\" They were also told that in-person appointments for asylum applicants to find out what decisions have been made on their cases would be canceled, at least for Monday.",
      "The guidance said officers could continue asylum application interviews and review cases up to the point of making a decision. \"Once you've reached decision entry, stop and hold,\" the directive said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow confirmed CBS News' reporting.",
      "\"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" Edlow said. \"The safety of the American people always comes first.\"",
      "According to Homeland Security officials, Lakanwal was allowed to enter the U.S. in September 2021 through the humanitarian parole policy, which the Biden administration used to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, the officials said.",
      "Following Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has unveiled a series of immigration measures it argues will bolster the government's ability to mitigate the chances of similar attacks.",
      "Officials first announced an indefinite pause on the processing of all legal immigration applications \u2014 ranging from citizenship and green card cases, to requests for work permits and asylum \u2014 filed by applicants from Afghanistan.",
      "Edlow, the USCIS director, then\u00a0announced he had ordered, at President Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries. That list, released in June and which the White House referred to as a \"travel ban,\" includes Afghanistan and other countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as Iran, as well as African nations, including Somalia and Sudan. Mr. Trump's order also applies to nationals of Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "USCIS published a policy Thursday that allows adjudicators to cite concerns about the inability to properly vet and identify green card applicants from the group of 19 countries as a potential reason to deny their cases.",
      "\"Certain countries (including but not limited to Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela) lack a competent or central authority for issuing passports and civil documents among other concerns, which directly relates to USCIS' ability to meaningfully assess eligibility for benefit requests including identity, and therefore whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion,\" USCIS said in its guidance.",
      "Late Thursday, Mr. Trump vowed to \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,\" writing on Truth Social that his administration would revoke the citizenship of those it deems \"undermine domestic tranquility\" and deport any foreigner \"who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\"",
      "The White House has not yet clarified publicly what actions would be taken to execute the president's announcement.",

      "\"I haven't heard of anyone step back,\" Morrisey told CBS News in an interview. \"They wanted to stay. They wanted to complete the mission and serve their state and country.\"",
      "Back in August, at President Trump's request, Morrisey was one of several Republican governors that deployed National Guard soldiers to D.C., with West Virginia\u00a0sending somewhere\u00a0between 300 and 400 Guard members.",
      "According to the military's Joint Task Force \u2013 District of Columbia, there are 180 West Virginia Guard members deployed in D.C. as of Friday. They are among about 1,300 out-of-state Guard troops that were dispatched to D.C. as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on crime in the city.",
      "Although Mr. Trump\u00a0has ordered\u00a0an additional 500 Guard personnel to D.C. in response to the shooting, Morrisey repeatedly sidestepped questions on whether West Virginia troops would join that surge.",
      "And though he expressed openness towards it, Morrisey said he will not pre-judge future deployment decisions, and avoided committing additional units.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focusing on the families, the guardsmen, and healing,\" the governor said. \"As time evolves, I'll keep talking with Guard leadership to make the right call.\"",
      "Still, he insisted the mission continues and should not be abandoned in the wake of the shooting.",
      "\"When evildoers come in and commit heinous acts, we can't back down,\" Morrisey said. \"That's exactly what they want.\"",
      "The suspect now faces charges of first degree murder. The former West Virginia attorney general told CBS News that the death penalty should remain \"on the table.\"",
      "Twenty-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and 24-year-old Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe was critically wounded.",
      "Morrisey, who met Beckstrom's parents at the hospital following her death, described the young soldier as deeply respected among her unit \u2014 someone whose presence \"brought positive energy to every room.\"",
      "\"She was loved and respected greatly,\" Morrisey said. \"There's an energy around her \u2014 people lining up to pay respects, showing sympathy, standing by their friend and the Guard.\"",
      "Wolfe, who remains in intensive care, comes from what Morrisey called \"a rich tradition of service.\" Wolfe's father serves in the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office, and his grandfather earned multiple Purple Hearts. \"His family asked for one thing \u2014 prayers,\" Morrisey said. \"He's fighting for his life.\"",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that following the ambush shooting, the suspected gunman, identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national, was stabbed with a pocketknife by a third Guard member, while a fourth returned fire and shot the suspect multiple times, ending the attack.",

      "The declaration follows Wednesday's shooting in downtown Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, in which a National Guard member was killed and a second Guard member critically wounded. The suspect detained in the shooting has been identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national who was admitted to the U.S. in September 2021, along with thousands of other Afghan refugees, a month after the U.S. withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.",
      "Since the shooting, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive stance on U.S. immigration policies it says are to blame for allowing the suspect into the U.S., and has vowed to change them.",

      "\"I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury.\"",
      "Biden signed 162 executive orders during his presidency, according to the American Presidency Project. It's unclear how many were signed using an autopen, though it's not unusual for presidents to revoke their predecessor's directives.",
      "Mr. Trump has already rolled back dozens of Biden's executive orders. The president rescinded nearly 70 of Biden's executive orders shortly after he was sworn in on Jan. 20 for his second term and another 19 on March 14, according to the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump previously ordered an investigation into the Biden White House's use of the autopen to sign presidential documents like pardons, claiming there was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",

      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",

      "The suspect was shot by another guard member and taken into custody, officials said. He is currently hospitalized. No other suspects have been identified in connection with the shooting, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Friday the suspect will be charged with murder in the first degree. On Thursday, she said he was facing charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.",
      "Here's what we know about the suspect so far. This story will be updated as additional information is confirmed.",
      "Suspect entered U.S. 4 years ago",
      "Lakanwal, 29, entered the United States in 2021, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on X\u00a0that the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on Sept. 8, 2021, under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome.",
      "The suspect and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan's Khost province, and relocated to Kabul before being transferred to the United States, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "President Trump described him as \"a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth,\" in a video message late Wednesday. He said the suspect's status was extended \"under legislation signed by President Biden.\"",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds back in 2021. That was the main legal mechanism the Biden administration used to welcome tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees after the Taliban takeover in August 2021.",
      "Lakanwal\u00a0later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",
      "Many of the Afghan nationals who were admitted to the U.S. in 2021 were issued special immigrant visas offered to those who worked alongside the military during its 20-year war, while others were given a temporary humanitarian status known as parole.",
      "More than 8,000 people from Afghanistan were also granted deportation relief under a separate program called temporary protected status, which Biden extended in 2023 but Mr. Trump chose to end earlier this year.",
      "Suspect had worked with U.S. forces and CIA in Afghanistan",
      "A CIA spokesperson confirmed Thursday that the suspect worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, during the war in Afghanistan.",
      "CBS News has also learned that the suspect led a team in the former Afghan national armed forces that worked directly with U.S. and British forces.",
      "Operational vetting conducted during the war was aimed largely at ensuring Afghan partner forces would not turn their weapons on U.S. personnel, and former intelligence officials said that the screening was not meant to serve as an immigration clearance.",
      "According to a former Afghan commando who spoke with CBS News on Thursday, Lakanwal led a unit of Afghan special forces in the south of the country and worked closely with the international troops.",
      "The former commando told CBS News that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom he said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday that a running theory of investigators is that the suspect suffered from paranoia and other mental health challenges that indicated he believed authorities sought to deport him from the U.S. Counterterrorism officials said that ISIS and al-Qaeda-aligned narratives often target former U.S. partner forces with messaging that they will be abandoned or deported. While the suspect repeatedly expressed a fear of deportation, investigators have not linked that anxiety to extremist propaganda or a specific organization, officials said. Investigators are searching for evidence of extremist influence.",
      "Suspect placed on a ventilator",
      "The suspect was subdued at the scene of the shooting and taken into custody by National Guard members and law enforcement officers, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "The suspect has been sedated and placed on a ventilator since the shooting, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. The treatment has complicated efforts to interview him and retain biometrics.",
      "Police say suspect was \"lone gunman\" who \"ambushed\" National Guard",
      "Carroll said the suspect appeared to be \"a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard\" as they patrolled near a mass transit station in downtown D.C.",
      "The suspect had four rounds in his handgun initially, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News. The revolver used in the attack was not registered to the suspect, according to investigators. Instead, it belonged to a deceased Washington state resident. Officials said the number of bullets in the weapon is unusual and remains unexplained.",
      "The first victim \u2014 a female guard member \u2014 was struck immediately and collapsed where she stood. She sustained at least two gunshot wounds during the ambush, the sources said.",
      "Then, the suspect took her weapon and used it to continue shooting, striking the second guard member, according to multiple sources. A third guard member, who was not injured, ultimately returned fire, ending the attack.",
      "One of the victims, 20-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, has died, Mr. Trump said Thursday. The second victim, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Pirro said earlier Thursday.",
      "The guard members were on \"high visibility patrols,\" Carroll said, part of a monthslong deployment of National Guard troops from D.C. and several states ordered by Mr. Trump.",
      "Suspect drove from Washington state",
      "Pirro said Thursday morning that the suspect drove to D.C. from Bellingham, in Washington state, with \"the intended target of coming to our nation's capital.\" She said the suspect lived with his wife and, officials believe, five children.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a search warrant had been executed at the suspect's last known address in Washington state. Based on what was found at the address, law enforcement were able to find people associated with him in San Diego.",
      "\"During that process, we seized numerous electronic devices to include cellphones, laptops, iPads and other material that is being analyzed as we speak,\" Patel said. \"Interviews were conducted and are going to continue to be conducted, and we will go anywhere in the country or the world where the evidence leads us.\"",
      "Multiple family members of the suspect in Washington state have been interviewed by investigators following a search of the suspect's Bellingham home, multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "U.S. intelligence analysts are combing the suspect's communications and online footprint for signs of international coordination or ideological radicalization, multiple U.S. officials said.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has lashed out at several female reporters who have asked him questions or written critically of him in recent weeks, calling them \"ugly,\" \"stupid,\" and \"piggy.\"",
      "The most recent incident came at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night, when CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked the president about the suspect in the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who was let into the U.S. under the Biden administration and granted asylum under the Trump administration.",
      "Cordes pointed out that the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Afghans who entered the U.S. after the fall of Kabul in 2021 had been thoroughly vetted. She asked the president: \"So why do you blame the Biden administration \u2014\"",
      "\"Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here, and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "On Wednesday, the president assailed New York Times correspondent Katie Rogers, who co-authored an article on his age and physical stamina in his second term, calling her \"third rate\" and \"ugly, both inside and out.\"",
      "The president's insults at Cordes and Rogers are just the latest in recent weeks that have been aimed at female reporters covering his presidency. While speaking to members of the press on Air Force One earlier this month, the president snapped at Bloomberg White House correspondent Catherine Lucey, telling her \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\"",
      "Lucey was asking the president about releasing the files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Asked about the comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump is \"very frank and honest\" with reporters and contrasted the president's willingness to take questions from the press to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think the president being frank and open and honest to your faces rather than hiding behind your backs, is, frankly, a lot more respectful than what you saw in the last administration, where you had a president who lied to your face and then didn't speak to you for weeks and hid upstairs and didn't take your questions,\" she said. \"So I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near daily basis.\"",
      "A Bloomberg spokesperson told the Washington Post that \"our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.\"",
      "Then last week, while hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce when she asked about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. An intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that bin Salman ordered the attack on Khashoggi.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Bruce of embarrassing the crown prince with her question and later called her a \"terrible person and a terrible reporter.\" The president said her question was \"horrible\" and \"insubordinate.\"",
      "Wednesday's insult against Rogers was provoked by a New York Times article published Tuesday that examined the frequency of the president's public events and domestic travel, as well as the timing of his appearances on his public schedule. At 79, Mr. Trump is the oldest person elected to serve as president.",
      "Signs of bruising on his right hand as well as swollen ankles have prompted new questions about Mr. Trump's health. The president also revealed to reporters last month that he underwent an MRI during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in April.",
      "Rogers' byline on the piece about Mr. Trump's aging in office is listed alongside another reporter, Dylan Freedman, a machine-learning engineer and journalist at the New York Times.",
      "The president attacked the Times and Rogers over the article, which he claimed was a \"hit piece.\" He called the newspaper a \"cheap 'rag'\" that is \"truly an 'enemy of the people.'\"",
      "\"The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\u00a0 He did not mention the story's co-author.",
      "The New York Times defended the article and Rogers.",
      "\"The Times' reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don't change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders.\"",
      "The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on Bruce and Lucey last week, which it said were not isolated and instead \"part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility \u2014 often directed at women \u2014 that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
      "\"Journalists are not props at a photo op \u2014 they are watchdogs for the public,\" Caroline Hendrie, executive director of the group, said in a statement. \"When reporters ask hard questions about the murder of a fellow journalist, that is not an embarrassment. What's embarrassing is a leader trying to silence those questions.\"",

In remarks Wednesday night addressing the shooting, Mr. Trump confirmed that he directed the department to mobilize an additional 500 troops to D.C. A U.S. official had told CBS News that the Army has received the request and will work to fulfill it quickly.",
      "The 500 additional service members will join roughly 2,200 troops who were deployed in D.C. as of Sunday morning. That includes around 900 members of the D.C.

      "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a statement that the \"processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,\" effective immediately.",
      "The announcement came shortly after the Department of Homeland Security announced publicly that the suspected shooter \u2014 who was shot by a Guard member and is now in custody \u2014 was a man named Rahmanullah Lakanwal who entered the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era initiative for Afghans called Operation Allies Welcome.",
      "President Trump said in remarks following the shooting: \"We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.\"",
      "The U.S. military evacuated tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan in 2021, as the United States' two-decade-long war in the country ended with the Taliban returning to power.",

That program was plagued by years of backlogs, however.",
      "Others from Afghanistan applied for asylum \u2014 which is offered to people fleeing persecution \u2014 or visas based on being family members of U.S. citizens or green card holders.",
      "And many were granted less permanent protections like humanitarian parole and temporary protected status, putting them in an uncertain situation with no clear pathway to permanent residency unless they qualified for some other immigration status.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News the shooting suspect was paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds in 2021. Lakanwal later applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 and his application was granted in 2025, the DHS official said. But his request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dc-shooting-national-guard-green-card-review-trump-administration/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The review comes after an Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 was arrested in the shooting of two National Guard members.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said Thursday it will be conducting a \"full-scale, rigorous reexamination\" of all green cards for every immigrant from \"a country of concern\" in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. An Afghan national who arrived in the U.S. in 2021 has been arrested as a suspect in Wednesday's attack.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday that the order had come at the request of President Trump. Two Homeland Security officials told CBS News there are 19 countries on that list, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela.",
      "Two members of the West Virginia National Guard, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot Wednesday near the White House in what authorities described as an \"ambush-style attack.\" President Trump on Thursday told reporters that Beckstrom had died from her injuries. Wolfe was in critical condition as of Thursday morning, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.",
      "The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was shot Wednesday by a member of the National Guard, ending the attack, authorities said. He faces three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, and he will also be charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Pirro said Thursday. The charges could still change pending the condition of the guard members.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect in Wednesday's shooting as Lakanwal, an Afghan national who authorities said was paroled into the U.S. in 2021 under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome. The CIA confirmed Thursday that Lakanwal had worked with the agency in Afghanistan.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday that the agency is now reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "It's unclear how wide-ranging Homeland Security's review of the asylum policies will be. The Trump administration ordered an unprecedented review and rescreening of all refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Biden administration earlier this month. Refugees and asylum-seekers have to meet the same legal definition, but arrive in the U.S. under different circumstances.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021, and his asylum case was granted earlier this year, while Mr. Trump was in office, a Homeland Security official told CBS News. In her statement, McLaughlin appeared to blame the shooting suspect's approval on a Biden-era court settlement that required the federal government to expedite the processing of Afghan asylum cases.",
      "Since the shooting, the Trump administration had already paused all immigration processing requests from Afghan nationals. An estimated 85,000 Afghans were settled in the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. In many cases, they were initially housed at military bases and flown to the U.S. after undergoing processing.",
      "Mr. Trump posted a video on social media on Wednesday night addressing the shooting, calling it an \"act of evil and an act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also noted that the suspect had come to the U.S. under the Biden-era program and vowed to \"reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country.\"",
      "\"No country can tolerate such a risk to our country,\" Mr. Trump added, while pivoting to discussing Somali immigrants in Minnesota.",
      "Earlier this week, CBS News reported that the Trump administration directed immigration officials to review the cases of refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden, as part of an unprecedented effort to identify potential reasons that would disqualify them from being able to stay in the U.S.",
      "Nicole  Sganga\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:39:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal judges have allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map designed to give Republicans an additional U.S. House seat.",
    "story": [
      "A panel of federal judges on Wednesday allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map aimed at flipping a seat to Republicans, as part of a multi-state redistricting campaign ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The map targets the state's only swing seat, currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis. The 1st District has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years. The state legislature's redrawing effort would shift the district from 48% to 44% Democratic, according to a CBS News analysis.",
      "The three-judge panel unanimously denied preliminary injunction requests after a hearing in Winston-Salem in mid-November. The day after the hearing, the same judges separately upheld several other redrawn U.S. House districts that GOP state lawmakers initially enacted in 2023. They were first used in the 2024 elections, contributing to a Republican gain of three more congressional seats.",
      "North Carolina is one of several states this year in which President Trump has directed the GOP to redraw maps in the middle of the decade \u2014 without courts requiring it \u2014 to avoid losing control of Congress in next year's midterms. Besides North Carolina, Republican-led legislatures or commissions in Texas and Missouri have adopted new, more GOP-friendly maps. A lower court froze Texas' new map last week, but the Supreme Court temporarily paused that ruling days later.",
      "In California, voters countered by adopting new districts drawn to improve Democrats' chances of winning more seats. And the Democratic-led Virginia General Assembly also has taken a step toward redistricting with a proposed constitutional amendment.",
      "Democrats need to gain just three seats to win control of the House and impede Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "North Carolina's Republican-controlled General Assembly gave final approval to the state's district changes on Oct. 22. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's approval wasn't needed.",
      "In a statement, North Carolina Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said the decision \"thwarts the radical left's latest attempt to circumvent the will of the people\" in a state that voted for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024.",
      "\"As Democrat-run states like California do everything in their power to undermine President Trump's administration and agenda, North Carolina Republicans went to work to protect the America First Agenda,\" Berger said.",
      "Wednesday's ruling covers two lawsuits.",
      "In one filed by the state NAACP, Common Cause and voters, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction on First Amendment grounds. They say Republican lawmakers unconstitutionally targeted North Carolina's \"Black Belt\" instead of Democratic-voting areas with higher White populations because in 2024 they organized and voted for their preferred candidates and had sued over the 2023 configuration of the district.",
      "In the second lawsuit, filed by voters, the case for a preliminary injunction rested in part on an argument that the use of five-year-old Census data due to the mid-decade redrawing of districts violates the Constitution, including the 14th Amendment's one-person, one-vote guarantee. Additionally, it says lawmakers relied on race in mapmaking in violation of the First and 14th Amendments.",
      "Attorneys for the Republican lawmakers defending the districts wrote that the objectives in redrawing the map were political, not racial, and were part of a \"nationwide partisan redistricting arms race.\" They rejected assertions about old Census data and retaliation over activities protected by the First Amendment, saying they don't align with Supreme Court precedent.",
      "Republicans now hold 10 of North Carolina's 14 House seats \u2014 thanks in part to the 2023 map \u2014 and they hope to flip an 11th under the latest redistricting changes to the 1st District and the adjoining 3rd District. This effort happened in a state where Trump got 51% of the popular vote in 2024 and statewide elections are often close. Candidate filing in these and scores of other 2026 North Carolina races has been slated to begin Dec. 1.",
      "The litigation challenging the October changes to the map said the boundaries approved by Republicans would result in the Black voting-age population in the 1st District falling from 40% in the 2023 map to 32%.",
      "Republicans in part moved counties in the 1st District with significant Black -\u2013 and usually highly Democratic -\u2013 populations to the 3rd District currently represented by Republican Greg Murphy. Recent election results indicate both the 1st and 3rd would be favorable for Republicans.",
      "Many of the same plaintiffs challenging the newly altered 1st District sued earlier over the House map enacted in 2023, alleging that Republicans unlawfully fractured and packed Black voters to weaken their voting power.",
      "But the judges \u2014 all nominated by Republican presidents \u2014 recently dismissed the claims against five other congressional districts and three legislative districts, writing that those who sued failed to prove legislators drew the maps \"with the discriminatory purpose of minimizing or canceling out the voting potential of Black North Carolinians.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Georgia judge on Wednesday agreed to dismiss the state's case against President Trump and his allies stemming from the 2020 presidential election after the local prosecutor who took over the case said he would no longer pursue the charges \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a brief order dismissing the case \"in its entirety\" shortly after Peter Skandalakis, who stepped in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she was disqualified from the case, filed a motion informing the court of his decision to abandon the prosecution of Mr. Trump and more than a dozen others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Skandalakis wrote in a memo accompanying the notice that overt acts listed in the indictment that were taken by the president and other Republicans \"are not acts I would consider sufficient\" to sustain a racketeering case. Skandalakis said that after reviewing the evidence, he concluded that a federal prosecution was more appropriate than one pursued by the state of Georgia, and said the \"strongest and most prosecutable case\" against those who allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election was the one being pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The president was charged with four federal counts stemming from an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but Smith dropped the case after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House.",
      "Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the Georgia case, said in response to Skandalakis' motion, \"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the prosecution an \"illegal, unconstitutional and unAmerican hoax.\"",
      "\"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates were indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 under Georgia's racketeering law and were accused of coordinating a scheme to thwart certification of the 2020 election results in the state. The indictment capped an extraordinary and historic five months, across which the president was charged in four separate cases involving allegations of conduct that bookended his first term in office. Mr. Trump was the first former president to be charged with a crime.",
      "Two of those cases were brought by Smith and involved federal offenses, and a third was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and stemmed from an alleged \"hush money\" payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Smith ended his prosecutions of the president \u2014 one related to the 2020 election and the other involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in January 2021 \u2014 after he won a second term.",
      "In the New York case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Mr. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts in Georgia, but several have been dismissed in the years since the indictment. He pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. Four of the president's 18 co-defendants accepted plea deals from prosecutors.",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County moved the slowest of the criminal cases involving the president, and proceedings were derailed for months by the bombshell revelation that Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor to assist in the investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "The two acknowledged the relationship but said it didn't begin until months after Wade was hired in November 2021.",
      "The trial court judge overseeing the case, Scott McAfee, held a multi-day hearing to examine whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade and travels with him, during which both prosecutors testified.",
      "McAfee ultimately declined to disqualify Willis from the case but said Wade had to step aside, which he did. But Mr. Trump and a group of his co-defendants appealed the ruling.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed McAfee's decision in December and said disqualification of Willis was the only remedy to restore public confidence in the integrity of the proceedings. The Georgia Supreme Court turned away Willis' appeal\u00a0in September, leaving the ruling mandating her removal from the case against Mr. Trump intact.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, which of Skandalakis is the executive director, was tasked with finding a replacement to take over the case from Willis.

    "summary": "Indiana is represented in Congress by 7 Republicans and 2 Democrats, but GOP leaders are pushing for redistricting that could result in a 9-0 map.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana's Republican legislature leaders announced Tuesday that they will be reconvening next week to consider a\u00a0redistricting\u00a0plan that could deliver two more GOP congressional seats, eliminating Democrats from the state's congressional delegation.",
      "Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, reversing course after a months-long dispute, said Tuesday that the lower chamber would reconvene Monday to take up redrawing the state's congressional map. State Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray announced Tuesday that the Senate would reconvene on Dec. 8 to \"make a final decision\" on \"any redistricting proposal from the House.\"",
      "President Trump congratulated Indiana Republicans, posting on social media, \"I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes.\"",
      "Indiana, a state Mr. Trump won by 19 points, has become the latest battleground in the redistricting wars. The state is currently represented by seven Republicans and two Democrats, and Mr. Trump and his allies have sought to redraw the state's congressional districts to make the two districts represented by Democrats more favorable to Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump and others in the administration have pressed\u00a0Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on the issue, and the governor said last month that he'd call on the legislature to reconvene for a special session in November to consider it. But Bray insisted publicly that the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, they simply agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "The president and his allies stepped up attacks on Republicans in the legislature, with Mr. Trump calling some out by name on social media and promising they'd face primaries.",
      "In recent days, Indiana Republicans have said they have been victims of harassment and swatting attempts. State Sen. Andy Zay confirmed a bomb threat was called in to his business. Braun said last week \"these threats to lawmakers, including those received by me and my family in recent days, need to stop.\"",
      "Bray acknowledged \"the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state.\"",
      "Redistricting normally occurs every 10 years after the conclusion of the decennial census. But since Republicans hold such a narrow majority in the House going into the 2026 midterm elections, Mr. Trump has been pushing GOP-led states to undertake mid-decade redistricting to draw more Republican districts.\u00a0Texas Republicans convened this summer to redraw the state's congressional maps to garner up to five more seats for the GOP.",
      "The effort gained national attention, leading California Gov. Gavin Newsom to push forward with a ballot initiative that would redraw the state's map to net up to five seats for Democrats, which the state's\u00a0voters overwhelming approved on Nov. 4. Other states scrambled to redraw their own maps, although some states require independent commissions to redraw their congressional map while others can be redrawn simply by state lawmakers.",
      "But lawmakers face increasingly tight time limits ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as filing deadlines loom for candidates. Candidates will also need to get to know their new districts during the primary season. Other races could be impacted as well. Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas is now mulling a Senate run, since her district was redrawn to be more friendly to Republicans.",
      "Redistricting plans are being challenged in court, though. A federal court in El Paso ordered\u00a0Texas to return to the 2021 map earlier this month, and Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton immediately appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:23:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The expiration of TPS policy for Haitian immigrants would make them eligible for deportation, unless they have other legal means to stay in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced Wednesday a renewed effort to terminate the Temporary Protected Status of more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants, saying they will be eligible for deportation in early February unless they have other legal means to remain in the U.S.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the decision after the Trump administration's initial attempts to end the TPS protections of hundreds of thousands of Haitians earlier this year were stalled in federal court.",
      "Noem acknowledged the humanitarian and political problems faced by crisis-stricken Haiti \u2014 including what she called \"widespread gang violence\" \u2014 but said extending the TPS policy would be at odds with U.S. interests.",
      "\"Based on the Department's review, the Secretary has determined that while the current situation in Haiti is concerning, the United States must prioritize its national interests and permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the U.S. national interest,\" the official DHS termination notice said.",
      "The TPS program for Haiti is now set to expire on Feb. 3, and the termination is expected to affect 352,959 beneficiaries, DHS said in its notice. Trump administration officials have urged TPS holders whose status is set to lapse to self-deport or face the prospect of being detained and forcibly removed from the U.S.",
      "TPS allows beneficiaries to work and live in the U.S. without fear of deportation for time periods outlined by DHS. The humanitarian program was created by Congress in 1990 to allow administrations to grant a temporary safe haven to foreigners from countries facing an armed conflict, an environmental disaster or other emergencies.",
      "The Biden administration vastly expanded the TPS policy, offering the protections to hundreds of thousands of new arrivals from Afghanistan, Haiti, Ukraine, Venezuela and other countries. Some of those who benefit from TPS entered the U.S. illegally, most commonly along the southern border, while others arrived legally on temporary visas or programs.",
      "As part of its government-wide immigration crackdown, the second Trump administration has sought to dismantle most TPS programs, revoking or moving to revoke legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Afghans, Burmese, Cameroonians, Haitians, Hondurans, Nepalis, Nicaraguans, Syrians, Sudanese and Venezuelans.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the TPS policy has been abused by Democratic administrations, exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, even though it is designed to be temporary in nature. In some cases, it has argued conditions in countries with TPS have improved and in other cases, it has said that extending the program would not further U.S. interests, even if conditions in the affected nations remain dire.",
      "In its notice Wednesday, DHS argued the TPS policy for Haiti was a magnet for illegal immigration, and that continuing the program posed national security and public safety risks. It cited concerns about its ability to properly vet Haitian migrants, and cases of some TPS holders from Haiti being implicated in immigration fraud or national security investigations.",

    "summary": "FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker speaks for the first time in an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" about his decision to resign after Zohran Mamdani's mayoral win in New York City.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.",
      "\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.",
      "In a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.",
      "Despite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.",
      "\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"",
      "According to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.",
      "In an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"",
      "However, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders \u2013 like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue \u2013 aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"",
      "\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.",
      "He pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"",
      "Tucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.",
      "\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.",
      "Inside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.",
      "\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their\u00a0 feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.",
      "Mamdani and his team have not responded to CBS News' requests for comment on this story.",

    "summary": "The number of immigration detainees without criminal records held in detention after getting arrested by ICE has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The number of immigration detainees without criminal records who are held in federal detention centers after getting arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration in January, according to official government data.",
      "The statistics, published online by ICE as part of a transparency requirement mandated by Congress, illustrate the wide-ranging scope of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "On Nov. 16, the government figures show, ICE was holding 65,135 people in detention facilities throughout the U.S., the highest level ever publicly reported by the agency, which was created in 2003 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. CBS News first reported the record detention levels earlier this month, citing internal data.",
      "The official figures indicate that 30,986 \u2013 or 48% \u2014 of the ICE detainees in custody as of Nov. 16 lacked any criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. and were being held solely because of civil violations of U.S. immigration law. ICE calls them \"immigration violators.\"",
      "Those with criminal convictions represented about 26%, or 17,171, of all ICE detainees on Nov. 16. The data show 16,978 individuals \u2014 another 26% of ICE's detainee population \u2014 had criminal charges.",
      "The statistics released by ICE do not specify the severity and nature of the charges or convictions for the detainees with criminal histories. They could range from violent or serious felonies, to misdemeanors and immigration-related crimes, such as illegal re-entry into the U.S.",
      "Illegal presence in the U.S., including after overstaying a visa, is not a crime by itself and is generally handled as a civil matter in immigration court. While illegal entry into the U.S. is a federal misdemeanor crime for a first-time offense with a 5-year statute of limitations, those accused of doing so typically have their cases treated as civil immigration violations, absent additional criminal activity.",
      "While all three categories of ICE detainees \u2014 immigration violators, those with criminal charges and those with criminal convictions \u2014 have grown under the second Trump administration, the statistics published by the agency indicate the non-criminal group has seen the most rapid and pronounced rise.",
      "ICE's detention population includes individuals arrested by that agency, typically in communities or jails inside of the U.S., as well as detainees transferred by Customs and Border Protection. Most detainees initially arrested by CBP, most commonly along the U.S.-Mexico border, historically have lacked criminal histories in the U.S. because many have not lived in the country for significant periods or at all.",
      "As of Nov. 16, 52,510 of ICE's detainees had been initially taken into custody by that agency, while 12,625 had been arrested by CBP.",
      "When focusing solely on ICE detainees initially arrested by that agency \u2014 and not CBP \u2014 the figures show a 2,143% spike in non-criminal detainees from Jan. 26 (945) to Nov. 16 (21,194). The number of detainees initially arrested by ICE who have convictions or criminal charges increased by 73% and 226%, respectively, during that same time period, according to the ICE data.",
      "The latest figures also indicate that for the first time, non-criminal detainees arrested by ICE outnumber those with criminal convictions. From Sept. 21 to Nov. 16, non-criminal detainees increased by about a third, while the number of detained with criminal convictions remained nearly flat.",
      "The numbers underscore that while the Trump administration has said its deportation effort would mainly focus on criminals deemed to be \"the worst of the worst,\" a growing share of those swept up under its crackdown are immigrants accused of living in the U.S. illegally but who otherwise lack any criminal history.",
      "At the same time, some senior Trump administration officials, including border czar Tom Homan and acting ICE director Todd Lyons, have said anyone encountered by immigration authorities and found to be in the U.S. illegally will be arrested, even if they're not the intended target of an operation. Those so-called \"collateral arrests\" had been largely banned under Biden-era rules the Trump administration scrapped.",
      "The government has the legal authority to arrest, detain and process for deportation anyone suspected of violating U.S. immigration law, irrespective of any criminal activity. But some of those individuals may be eligible for forms of legal relief, such as asylum, that can stall or halt their deportation.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration is \"targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\u2014including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.\" She said 70% of those arrested by ICE had criminal charges or convictions, but did not specify a timeframe or offer a breakdown to support the percentage.",
      "McLaughlin also said detainees listed as non-criminals could have warrants or criminal histories outside of the U.S., or otherwise pose a threat to national security. But DHS has not released data showing how many people fall into those categories.",

      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to the U.S. before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Taking to Truth Social\u00a0on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",
      "The president said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and that Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainians.",
      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that \"we're making progress.\" Asked what points of disagreement remain, he said, \"standard things,\" but \"people are starting to realize it's a good deal for both parties.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed \u2014 President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",

    "summary": "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem made the final decision to allow a group of deportees to be handed over to El Salvador after a judge said their flights must be returned to the U.S., the DOJ said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem made the final decision to allow a group of deportees to be handed over to El Salvador after a judge said their flights must be returned to the United States, the Justice Department said in a court filing Tuesday.",
      "The filing came as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg continues his inquiry into whether the Trump administration violated his orders to halt the mid-March deportation flights, including his verbal directive that the government resort to \"turning around a plane\" if necessary. Boasberg has accused the government of showing a \"willful disregard\" for his rulings.",
      "The administration, the Justice Department argued on Tuesday, \"did not violate\" Boasberg's order, and \"no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate.\"",
      "But the administration did identify which Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department officials were involved in the decision not to turn the deportation flights around.",
      "Shortly after Boasberg issued his rulings, Justice Department official Drew Ensign conveyed them to the DHS and Justice Department leadership, according to Tuesday's filing. Then, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove offered advice to DHS's acting general counsel, who passed on the advice to Noem.",
      "Noem concluded the class of detainees \"who had been removed from the United States before the Court's order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing says this move \"was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court's order.\"",
      "The flights in question were part of a Trump administration initiative to send accused Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, whose government held them in prison for months. The administration argues that gambit was legal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and warranted as part of its crackdown on violent crime, but it has faced pushback from courts and advocates who argue the deportees weren't given sufficient due process.",
      "One lawsuit brought by migrants led Boasberg to order a temporary halt to removals under the Alien Enemies Act, including by returning deportation flights that had already taken off. But the midair flights continued on to El Salvador. Boasberg accused the government of disobeying those orders, and said there is probable cause to hold the government in contempt of court.",
      "The administration has long denied that it disobeyed Boasberg, pointing to discrepancies between his written and verbal orders on March 15. The judge blocked a set of Alien Enemies Act deportations in his written order, but unlike in his verbal order earlier in the day, he didn't explicitly reiterate that the government must turn around planes that were already en route.",
      "Appeals court judges tossed out Boasberg's finding of probable cause, but a different panel later said that Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order. He signaled last week that he will resume his contempt of court inquiry.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the plaintiffs, has asked for more than half a dozen potential DHS and Justice Department witnesses to be put on the stand in open court to testify about the decision not to turn the planes around.",
      "One witness that the ACLU suggested is former Justice Department attorney Erez Revueni, who has accused the department of trying to defy or mislead judges in several instances, including in the deportation case. The department has denied Reuveni's allegations.",
      "The department responded on Tuesday: \"No live testimony is warranted at this time.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday the National Park Service is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. national parks each year $100 per person to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.",
      "The fee change for international visitors will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the Interior Department.",
      "As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.",
      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year\u00a0budget proposal\u00a0released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge on international visitors would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "\"There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation \u2013 all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,\" Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.",
      "The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.",
      "The \"resident-only patriotic fee-free days\" next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that \"everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed immigration officials to review the cases of refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden, as part of an unprecedented effort to identify potential reasons that would disqualify them from being able to stay in the U.S., an internal federal government memo obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "The memo, dated Nov. 21 and signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow, instructs agency officials to investigate the cases of refugees who entered the U.S. over a four-year period, between Jan. 20, 2021, and Feb. 20, 2025.",
      "Edlow directed USCIS officials to review the cases of all refugees admitted during this time period, and to potentially reinterview them. Those investigations and reinterviews, Edlow wrote, would focus on determining whether those individuals met the definition of a refugee when they entered the U.S. and whether there are any legal barriers that would make them ineligible to become permanent residents of the U.S.",
      "The memo also placed an indefinite hold on all pending applications for green cards (or permanent residency) filed by refugees allowed into the country during the timeframe outlined in the memo. Under U.S. law, refugees are eligible for permanent residency one year after being admitted.",
      "Edlow noted that applicants cannot appeal any denials of their green card cases. If the cases of \"principal\" refugees \u2014 or the main applicant if they arrived with their family members \u2014 are rejected, their relatives' cases would also be denied, and they would be stripped of their refugee status, according to the memo. Those whose applications are denied can be placed in deportation proceedings.",
      "Refugees have to prove they suffered or fled persecution abroad based on one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a social group.",
      "Some 233,000 refugees entered the U.S. between February 2021 and January 2025, a period that largely lines up with the Biden administration, according to federal statistics.",
      "The federal government paused the refugee program shortly after President Trump retook office. Officials have made limited exceptions, mostly for Afrikaners, or people in South Africa who are the descendants of European settlers.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest level in history. Those slots will \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners,\" who the Trump administration alleges have faced discrimination in South Africa for being White, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" The South African government has denied that Afrikaners are being persecuted.",
      "Before the pause, refugees typically spent years in third countries undergoing medical checks, security screenings and interviews prior to being admitted into the U.S.",
      "But in his memo, Edlow said the Trump administration believes the Biden administration \"prioritized expediency, quantity, and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia has agreed to pay nearly $5.2 million in overdue personal taxes, the latest saga for the former billionaire who has been followed by a trail of financial challenges going back well over a decade.",
      "An attorney for Justice and his wife, Cathy, entered into a joint motion for consent judgment with the federal government on Monday, the same day the government filed a lawsuit saying the couple \"have neglected or refused to make full payment\" for the income taxes dating to 2009. An attorney for the Justice Department's tax division signed off on the agreement.",
      "Justice had a fortune estimated at $1.9 billion last decade by Forbes magazine, which stripped his billionaire title in 2021, when Justice's worth had dwindled to an estimated $513 million. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated that Justice's net worth had disintegrated to \"less than zero\" due to liabilities that far exceeded assets.",
      "A spokesperson for Justice's office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "During a briefing with local media in October, Justice asserted that his companies \"are complicated and complex\" and that his children \"are doing a magnificent job\" running them. He then repeated past assertions that collection efforts against him were politically motivated, before concluding: \"At the end of the day, I'd say just let it be and see how it all plays out.\"",
      "Justice, a former two-term governor who owns dozens of businesses that include coal and agricultural operations, was elected last November to the Senate. He took over the seat vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin, a Democrat who became an independent in 2024 near the end of his second full term.",
      "Justice still has other financial challenges to work out.",
      "The Internal Revenue Service last month filed liens totaling more than $8 million against Justice and his wife on unpaid personal taxes. In September, state tax officials filed $1.4 million in liens against the Justice family's historic hotel, The Greenbrier, and the resort's Greenbrier Sporting Club, over unpaid sales taxes.",
      "Last month, a foreclosure auction on several hundred lots owned by the Justice family at a resort community near Beckley was paused. The auction centered on a dispute between the Glade Springs Village Property Owners Association and Justice Holdings over unpaid fees. The state Supreme Court plans to review the case more closely.",
      "In 2021, the IRS filed liens over $1.1 million in unpaid taxes on the Greenbrier Hotel and an additional $80,000 on the resort's medical clinic. Those debts were paid off later that year.",
      "Justice's family settled debts last year in a separate case to avoid the Greenbrier Hotel's foreclosure. The 710-room hotel, which has hosted U.S. presidents, royalty and congressional retreats, had come under threat of being auctioned off on the steps of a Lewisburg courthouse. That was after JPMorgan Chase sold a longstanding loan taken out by Justice to a credit collection company, Beltway Capital, which declared it to be in default.",
      "The state Democratic Party has said efforts to seize the hotel from Justice were \"a direct consequence of his own financial incompetence.\"",
      "Last year, a union official at the Greenbrier said that Justice's family was at least $2.4 million behind in payments to an employees' health insurance fund, putting workers' coverage at risk. In 2023, dozens of properties owned by the Justice family in three counties were auctioned as payment for delinquent real estate taxes. Others have sought to recoup millions in fines for environmental issues and unsafe working conditions at his company's coal mines.",
      "Justice bought The Greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy in 2009 for $20.1 million. The sporting club is a private equity club and residential community on the property that opened in 2000.",
      "The resort in White Sulphur Springs that dates to 1778 also has a casino, spa and dozens of amenities and employs around 2,000 workers. The resort held a PGA Tour golf tournament from 2010 until 2019 and has welcomed NFL teams for training camp and practices. A once-secret 112,000-square-foot underground bunker built for Congress at the Greenbrier in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War now hosts tours.",

    "story": [
      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:55:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump housing official Bill Pulte also submitted criminal referrals for investigations into Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump housing official Bill Pulte, who referred him to the Justice Department earlier this month for an investigation of mortgage and tax fraud allegations.",
      "Swalwell, who entered the California governor's race last week, filed the 19-page federal civil lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia accusing Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, of violations of privacy in obtaining Swalwell's mortgage records. The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of engaging in a pattern of political retribution through the courts.",
      "\"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "Pulte has also submitted criminal referrals to the Justice Department for investigations of Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The allegations against Swalwell are related to the mortgage on his property in Washington, D.C., CBS News previously reported.",
      "Swalwell's lawsuit says that the disclosure of his mortgage records harmed his reputation \"at a critical juncture in his career: the very moment when he had planned to announce his campaign for Governor of California.\"",
      "The civil complaint said that \"before President Trump reassumed office in January 2025, he routinely threatened to use his power to punish his political opponents,\" and then continued that \"after taking office, he wasted little time in following through on those threats.\"",
      "James' criminal case was dismissed Monday after a judge found that the interim U.S. attorney who secured her indictment was improperly appointed. James has also sought to have her case tossed out on other grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "Pulte referred Schiff to the Justice Department in May for investigation over alleged mortgage fraud. Sources told CBS News last week that the Justice Department is investigating the probe into Schiff, who has denied any wrongdoing.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:16:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The discovery could cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the\u00a0species of the famous Lucy, scientists said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery is the latest twist in the tale of human evolution and could even cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",
      "\"We don't know -- it depends on what we find.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 07:13:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Wolf DNA seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, scientists said.",
    "story": [
      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",

      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

      "The Shenzhou 22 will be used sometime in 2026 by the three astronauts who docked on the Tiangong space station on Nov. 1.",
      "Earlier this month, another group of Chinese astronauts from the Shenzhou 20 mission faced a nine-day delay in their return to Earth after their craft's window was damaged. They eventually returned using the Shenzhou 21 spacecraft, which had just carried the replacement crew to Tiangong.",
      "While the three-person crew landed safely on Earth, three of their fellow astronauts on the replacement crew were temporarily left without a guaranteed way to return in case of an emergency.",
      "The Shenzhou 20 spacecraft - the damaged one, which for now remains in space - will be brought down to Earth later and assessed, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The space program determined it didn't meet safety standards for transporting the astronauts.",
      "Chinese astronauts have been carrying out missions to the Tiangong space station in recent years as part of Beijing's rapidly progressing space program, initially building out the station module-by-module.",

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",

      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",

    "story": [
      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2014 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS News these types of accounts are fueled by public interest in current events and America's highly polarized politics.",
      "\"It is shining a light on this new rage economy that exists on social media, including X, that takes advantage of current things,\" Krebs said. \"What's the latest event? As we've seen over the last couple of years ... there has been a rightward shift of the platform. And I think what we're really seeing here is foreign-based accounts that are looking to make a little bit of money and taking advantage of this.\"",
      "He added, \"I think X deserves some credit to shine a light, to kind of expose some of these. ... I suspect you'll see a bunch of these accounts lose influence.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.\"",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration on Friday directed officials to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to pause all asylum decisions in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "The move is the administration's latest effort to tighten the American immigration system after Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who was granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials earlier this year.",
      "Asylum officers at USCIS, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, were instructed to refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications received by the agency, according to the internal notice and sources, who requested anonymity to describe an action that has not been publicly announced.",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would start a review of asylum approvals under the Biden administration, citing the shooting of the two National Guard members, one of whom has died. The man accused of shooting the soldiers, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 during former President Joe Biden's presidency and was granted asylum this spring under the second Trump administration.",
      "The action relayed to USCIS asylum officers internally on Friday amounts to an indefinite pause on asylum adjudications for all nationalities. Asylum cases are filed by foreigners who claim they will suffer persecution if deported or returned to their home countries because of certain factors, including their race, nationality, religion or political views.",
      "\"Do not enter any decision information for affirmative cases,\" a USCIS notice to asylum officers in one office read, referring to asylum cases overseen by the agency. \"Defensive\" cases, the other type of asylum applications, are filed by those facing deportation and are decided by federal immigration judges at the Justice Department.",
      "Officers were told the pause applied to all USCIS asylum cases, including those filed by Afghans who arrived under a Biden administration resettlement effort dubbed \"Operation Allies Welcome.\" They were also told that in-person appointments for asylum applicants to find out what decisions have been made on their cases would be canceled, at least for Monday.",
      "The guidance said officers could continue asylum application interviews and review cases up to the point of making a decision. \"Once you've reached decision entry, stop and hold,\" the directive said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Friday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow confirmed CBS News' reporting.",
      "\"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" Edlow said. \"The safety of the American people always comes first.\"",
      "According to Homeland Security officials, Lakanwal was allowed to enter the U.S. in September 2021 through the humanitarian parole policy, which the Biden administration used to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, the officials said.",
      "Following Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has unveiled a series of immigration measures it argues will bolster the government's ability to mitigate the chances of similar attacks.",
      "Officials first announced an indefinite pause on the processing of all legal immigration applications \u2014 ranging from citizenship and green card cases, to requests for work permits and asylum \u2014 filed by applicants from Afghanistan.",
      "Edlow, the USCIS director, then\u00a0announced he had ordered, at President Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries. That list, released in June and which the White House referred to as a \"travel ban,\" includes Afghanistan and other countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as Iran, as well as African nations, including Somalia and Sudan. Mr. Trump's order also applies to nationals of Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "USCIS published a policy Thursday that allows adjudicators to cite concerns about the inability to properly vet and identify green card applicants from the group of 19 countries as a potential reason to deny their cases.",
      "\"Certain countries (including but not limited to Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela) lack a competent or central authority for issuing passports and civil documents among other concerns, which directly relates to USCIS' ability to meaningfully assess eligibility for benefit requests including identity, and therefore whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion,\" USCIS said in its guidance.",

    "summary": "The prison picked nearly 30 inmates to participate in the \"father-daughter\" dance at the Louisiana State Penitentiary.",
    "story": [
      "Leslie Harris has missed most milestones in his daughter's life while serving a decades-long sentence in Louisiana for armed robbery and is unlikely to get out before her prom, her graduation and maybe even her wedding.",
      "But for one night at Louisiana's largest maximum-security prison, Harris made his own moment with his 17-year-old daughter while donning a custom tux and clutching a bouquet of roses: reuniting at the prison's first father-daughter dance, where they embraced to Stevie Wonder's \"Isn't She Lovely\" at a pink-heavy party this month that was widely shared on social media.",
      "\"Seeing her in a dress, crying and running to me just broke me down,\" said Harris, who has nine years left on his sentence, in a phone interview from the Louisiana State Penitentiary. \"It made me think of all the years I missed out on in her life.\"",
      "The lockup is the latest in the U.S. to hold a daddy-daughter dance, including one in Washington D.C. that was featured in the Netflix documentary \"Daughters\" last year. In Louisiana, prison officials say the dance could become another tradition at the rural lockup in Angola, which every October hosts the country's last remaining prison rodeo. It has more than 6,300 prisoners, including dozens of people on death row, and is on the same grounds where a notorious lockup was converted into an immigration detention facility in September.",
      "Assistant Warden Anne-Marie Easley said she hoped the dance would bring a sense of hope that can be elusive in a prison\u00a0where many are serving decades-long or life sentences. For some men, it was a chance to reunite with their daughters for the first time in months or even years - an opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal wounds. For others, it meant a night where they wouldn't be seen as an inmate but rather a dad.",
      "The prison picked nearly 30 inmates to participate due to good behavior, among other factors. Videos posted from the event showed fathers in tuxedos - complete with pink boutonnieres - breaking down in tears as their daughters ran up to them in sparkly dresses, shrieking with excitement. They reunited in the middle of a pink carpet overlayed with petals, with breezy drapes hanging overhead. A dance space was setup in the prison's Bible college.",
      "The dance was put on by God Behind Bars, which hosts other reunification events and religious services in prisons nationwide. In videos the group posted before the dance, some prisoners said they wanted to apologize for all the years they missed. Others called the dance the most important prison visit of their lives.",
      "The night included the men surprising their daughters with a line dance after weeks of practice. For Harris, the best part was when he and his daughter slow danced to 'Butterfly Kisses,' a song about a dad's unconditional love for his daughter.",
      "In that moment, Harris said memories rushed back of life before prison, when his daughter was just 2 years old. How she would sleep on his chest, play with his hair and how he would buy her little dresses. Before the night was over, he gave her a Bible with passages he highlighted.",
      "\"That's really the heart of it at the end of the day,\" said Jake Bodine, founder of God Behind Bars. \"Show these individuals who is counting on them and once they realize the weight of that, they will hold themselves accountable for change.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 08:00:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Meghan Jenkins' son was 2 years old when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021. His prognosis was grim, but aggressive treatment saved his life.",
    "story": [
      "Meghan Jenkins had her hands full with her toddler, Malachi. He was energetic and inquisitive, eager to explore the world around him. He loved anything to do with the Miami Dolphins and played constantly with dinosaurs and monster trucks. He was settling in at day care while Jenkins returned to work after taking a year off. Life was busy, but happy.",
      "In March 2021, Jenkins noticed Malachi was tired and lethargic. He also had a lingering cough. One day, he threw up. When Jenkins changed his diaper, she found black stool. Immediately concerned, she and Malachi went straight to the emergency room.",
      "Things moved quickly then, Jenkins said. Malachi was \"connected to all these cords.\" Someone said he might need a blood transfusion. Hours passed with no answers. Jenkins grew more scared by the minute. Finally, Malachi was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where doctors performed a bone marrow biopsy.",
      "Finally, a doctor sat Jenkins down for the diagnosis: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She was told her little boy's life expectancy could be just two and a half to three more years.",
      "\"In that moment, you question God. You ask him 'Why did this happen?'\" Jenkins said. \"I was so lost. This was my only child. I was young still, going through life, trying to figure things out. And then I had a big hit.\"",
      "What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia?",
      "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is a rare cancer that starts in the bone marrow, according to the American Cancer Society's website. Only about 6,100 new cases of ALL are diagnosed a year, according to the American Cancer Society, with children under the age of 5 having the highest risk of developing the disease.",
      "ALL is a fast-growing cancer that results in the body producing immature white blood cells. Malachi's white blood cell count was more than 10 times higher than it should be. The white blood cells were crowding out healthy cells, weakening his immune system and making it impossible for his body to fight off infections.",
      "ALL can quickly spread throughout the body and affect the lymph nodes, liver, spleen and other organs, as well as the central nervous system. Because the cancer grows so quickly, immediate treatment is key.",
      "Malachi was already \"quite sick\" when he was diagnosed, said Dr. Julio Barredo, the director of pediatric cancer programs at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. She started Malachi on chemotherapy immediately.",
      "Treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
      "For the first month of treatment, Malachi was hospitalized. The first weeks of chemotherapy are intense, so staying in the hospital is often safer, said pediatric hematologist Dr. Aditi Dhir. Malachi had side effects including nausea and fatigue. He regressed in his potty training. Jenkins needed to wear gloves to hold him because of his compromised immune system. The toddler milestones she'd expected to celebrate were nowhere to be seen.",
      "\"There were days I didn't even think I was going to go on, but I had to,\" Jenkins said. \"It was stressful. It was depressing, constantly being in there.\"",
      "Still, the chemotherapy was clearly helping Malachi, Dhir said. She recalled seeing him run around the PICU within a week of starting treatment. Barredo said that Malachi handled the chemotherapy \"as well as anybody could have handled it given the circumstances.\"",
      "After the first month, Malachi continued chemotherapy at home. He took eight medications a day, Jenkins said, and spent several days a week in the hospital. Next came the \"maintenance\" phase, Barredo said. During this time, Malachi remained on oral medication and only needed to go to the hospital every few weeks, Dhir explained. The maintenance phase lasted for two years.",
      "Finally, in August 2023, \"the storm blew over,\" Jenkins said. Malachi was able to ring the bell that signified the completion of cancer treatment.",
      "\"You can't tell he ever had leukemia\"",
      "Today, Malachi is a \"very loving\" 7-year-old who excels in school, takes gifted classes and regularly appears on the honor roll, Jenkins said. He still cheers for the Dolphins and plays with dinosaurs and trucks. He's become a big reader and loves to share fun facts.",
      "Most importantly, he is in remission. With acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the highest risk of relapse is within the first year of completing therapy, Barredo said. Malachi passed that milestone with flying colors. There's \"some risk\" of relapse in the second year, Barredo said, but Malachi and Jenkins marked that in August without incident. After two years, it \"is quite unusual\" for an ALL patient to relapse, Barredo said. Malachi has outperformed his initial prognosis, and the success of his treatment means \"his life expectancy is like that of any other kid his age.\"",
      "\"You look at him, you can't tell he ever had leukemia,\" Barredo said. \"For all practical purposes, he is pretty much cured at this point in time. ... He'll be able to do whatever he wants to do.\"",
      "Malachi's immune system remains compromised, Jenkins said, but she hopes to build it up so can have a normal childhood going forward. The family is looking forward to \"finally blossoming\" after the years of treatment and trauma.",
      "\"This whole process was very hard. It's still hard. I have moments sometimes where I'm in shock, like I don't believe we went through this or this even happened,\" Jenkins said. \"But there is a brighter situation. Every situation doesn't have this outcome. But there are brighter outcomes. There are happier days than just being in the hospital and being sad.\"",

      "\"I haven't heard of anyone step back,\" Morrisey told CBS News in an interview. \"They wanted to stay. They wanted to complete the mission and serve their state and country.\"",
      "Back in August, at President Trump's request, Morrisey was one of several Republican governors that deployed National Guard soldiers to D.C., with West Virginia\u00a0sending somewhere\u00a0between 300 and 400 Guard members.",
      "According to the military's Joint Task Force \u2013 District of Columbia, there are 180 West Virginia Guard members deployed in D.C. as of Friday. They are among about 1,300 out-of-state Guard troops that were dispatched to D.C. as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on crime in the city.",
      "Although Mr. Trump\u00a0has ordered\u00a0an additional 500 Guard personnel to D.C. in response to the shooting, Morrisey repeatedly sidestepped questions on whether West Virginia troops would join that surge.",
      "And though he expressed openness towards it, Morrisey said he will not pre-judge future deployment decisions, and avoided committing additional units.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focusing on the families, the guardsmen, and healing,\" the governor said. \"As time evolves, I'll keep talking with Guard leadership to make the right call.\"",
      "Still, he insisted the mission continues and should not be abandoned in the wake of the shooting.",
      "\"When evildoers come in and commit heinous acts, we can't back down,\" Morrisey said. \"That's exactly what they want.\"",
      "The suspect now faces charges of first degree murder. The former West Virginia attorney general told CBS News that the death penalty should remain \"on the table.\"",
      "Twenty-year-old Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and 24-year-old Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe was critically wounded.",
      "Morrisey, who met Beckstrom's parents at the hospital following her death, described the young soldier as deeply respected among her unit \u2014 someone whose presence \"brought positive energy to every room.\"",
      "\"She was loved and respected greatly,\" Morrisey said. \"There's an energy around her \u2014 people lining up to pay respects, showing sympathy, standing by their friend and the Guard.\"",
      "Wolfe, who remains in intensive care, comes from what Morrisey called \"a rich tradition of service.\" Wolfe's father serves in the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office, and his grandfather earned multiple Purple Hearts. \"His family asked for one thing \u2014 prayers,\" Morrisey said. \"He's fighting for his life.\"",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that following the ambush shooting, the suspected gunman, identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national, was stabbed with a pocketknife by a third Guard member, while a fourth returned fire and shot the suspect multiple times, ending the attack.",
      "President Trump said Thursday that the suspect remains hospitalized in serious condition.",

      "In a July statement, Biden called Mr. Trump's claims \"nothing more than distraction.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has lashed out at several female reporters who have asked him questions or written critically of him in recent weeks, calling them \"ugly,\" \"stupid,\" and \"piggy.\"",
      "The most recent incident came at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night, when CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked the president about the suspect in the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who was let into the U.S. under the Biden administration and granted asylum under the Trump administration.",
      "Cordes pointed out that the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Afghans who entered the U.S. after the fall of Kabul in 2021 had been thoroughly vetted. She asked the president: \"So why do you blame the Biden administration \u2014\"",
      "\"Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here, and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "On Wednesday, the president assailed New York Times correspondent Katie Rogers, who co-authored an article on his age and physical stamina in his second term, calling her \"third rate\" and \"ugly, both inside and out.\"",
      "The president's insults at Cordes and Rogers are just the latest in recent weeks that have been aimed at female reporters covering his presidency. While speaking to members of the press on Air Force One earlier this month, the president snapped at Bloomberg White House correspondent Catherine Lucey, telling her \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\"",
      "Lucey was asking the president about releasing the files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Asked about the comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump is \"very frank and honest\" with reporters and contrasted the president's willingness to take questions from the press to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think the president being frank and open and honest to your faces rather than hiding behind your backs, is, frankly, a lot more respectful than what you saw in the last administration, where you had a president who lied to your face and then didn't speak to you for weeks and hid upstairs and didn't take your questions,\" she said. \"So I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near daily basis.\"",
      "A Bloomberg spokesperson told the Washington Post that \"our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor. We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.\"",
      "Then last week, while hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce when she asked about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. An intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that bin Salman ordered the attack on Khashoggi.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Bruce of embarrassing the crown prince with her question and later called her a \"terrible person and a terrible reporter.\" The president said her question was \"horrible\" and \"insubordinate.\"",
      "Wednesday's insult against Rogers was provoked by a New York Times article published Tuesday that examined the frequency of the president's public events and domestic travel, as well as the timing of his appearances on his public schedule. At 79, Mr. Trump is the oldest person elected to serve as president.",
      "Signs of bruising on his right hand as well as swollen ankles have prompted new questions about Mr. Trump's health. The president also revealed to reporters last month that he underwent an MRI during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in April.",
      "Rogers' byline on the piece about Mr. Trump's aging in office is listed alongside another reporter, Dylan Freedman, a machine-learning engineer and journalist at the New York Times.",
      "The president attacked the Times and Rogers over the article, which he claimed was a \"hit piece.\" He called the newspaper a \"cheap 'rag'\" that is \"truly an 'enemy of the people.'\"",
      "\"The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\u00a0 He did not mention the story's co-author.",
      "The New York Times defended the article and Rogers.",
      "\"The Times' reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don't change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders.\"",
      "The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Mr. Trump's attacks on Bruce and Lucey last week, which it said were not isolated and instead \"part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility \u2014 often directed at women \u2014 that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
      "\"Journalists are not props at a photo op \u2014 they are watchdogs for the public,\" Caroline Hendrie, executive director of the group, said in a statement. \"When reporters ask hard questions about the murder of a fellow journalist, that is not an embarrassment.

      "In the weeks before her death, Kristil Krug had told police she and her husband Dan Krug had received threatening texts and emails from a stalker, who she believed was Holland.",
      "So within hours after Kristil Krug's murder, investigators in Colorado asked police in Utah to pay Holland a visit at his home about 500 miles away from the crime scene.",
      "But Holland had an airtight alibi. At 12:16 p.m. the day of the murder he was at a local department store buying a sweatshirt, making it impossible for him to have made the journey to Colorado and back. He showed police a time-dated stamped receipt. He was immediately cleared by police.",
      "Holland told \"48 Hours\" he believes Kristil's \"spirit\" played an important role in establishing his sweatshirt alibi and exonerating him that day.",

      "A telescope in Chile has captured a stunning new picture of a grand and graceful cosmic butterfly.",
      "The National Science Foundation's NoirLab released the picture on Wednesday. The glowing \"wings\" appear to be bursting in the image. While the bipolar nebula goes by the monikers Butterfly Nebula, Bug Nebula or Caldwell 69, its official name is NGC 6302.",
      "Snapped last month by the Gemini South telescope \u2014 half of the International Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a mountain in Central Chile \u2014 the aptly named Butterfly Nebula is 2,500 to 3,800 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "At the heart of this bipolar nebula is a white dwarf star that cast aside its outer layers of gas long ago. The discarded gas forms the butterfly-like wings billowing from the aging star, whose heat causes the gas to glow.",
      "Students in Chile chose this astronomical target to celebrate 25 years of operation by the International Gemini Observatory.",
      "\"This picturesque object was chosen as a target for the 8.1-meter [26.5-foot] telescope by students in Chile as part of the Gemini First Light Anniversary Image Contest,\" NoirLab wrote on its website. \"The contest engaged students in the host locations of the Gemini telescopes to celebrate the legacy that the International Gemini Observatory has built since its completion, marked by Gemini South's First Light in November 2000.\"",
      "It's not known exactly when NGC 6302 was discovered, NoirLab says, but a 1907 study by American astronomer Edward E. Barnard is often credited. Scottish astronomer James Dunlop could also have discovered it in 1826.",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",

      "Only approximately 100 of the more than 400 parks in the national park system collect an entrance fee.",
      "The announcement declaring \"America-first entry fee policies\" comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. The park service furloughed well over half its staff during the shutdown.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "A White House social media post laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, \"AMERICANS FIRST.\"",
      "The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump last week released a plan for ending the nearly four-year war. The 28-point proposal heavily favored Russia, prompting Zelenskyy to quickly engage with American negotiators. European leaders, fearing for their own future in the face of Russian aggression, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that his plan to end the war had been \"fine-tuned\" and that he's sending envoy Steve Witkoff to Russia to meet with Putin and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials. He suggested he could eventually meet with Putin and Zelenskyy, but not until further progress has been made in negotiations.",
      "Zelenskyy announced Friday the resignation of his powerful chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, who was also the country's lead negotiator in talks with the U.S, after anti-corruption investigators searched Yermak's residence.

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 08:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Pope Leo toured the 17th-century mosque, but did not pray there.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV\u00a0visited Istanbul's Blue Mosque on Saturday on the second day of\u00a0his trip\u00a0to Turkey and stressed the need for Christian unity in meetings and liturgies with the country's Christian leaders.",
      "Leo was following in the footsteps of his recent predecessors, who all made high-profile visits to the mosque in a gesture of respect to Turkey's Muslim majority. Leo did not pray at the mosque despite an invitation by an imam. Speaking to reporters after the visit, Asgin Tunca said he had told the pope that the mosque was \"Allah's house.\"",
      "\"It's not my house, not your house, (it's the) house of Allah,\" he said. He said he told Leo: \"'If you want, you can worship here,' I said. But he said, 'That's OK.'\"",
      "\"He wanted to see the mosque, wanted to feel (the) atmosphere of the mosque, I think. And was very pleased,\" he said.",
      "After the mosque visit, Leo met with Turkey's Christian leaders at the Syriac Orthodox Church of Mor Ephrem.",
      "This is the pope's first foreign trip. He will also visit Lebanon.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, is expected to speak in broader terms about peace in the Middle East.",
      "Papal visits to Blue Mosque often raise questions",
      "Other visits have always raised questions about whether the pope would pray in the Muslim house of worship, or at the very least pause to gather thoughts in a meditative silence.",
      "When Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey in 2006, tensions were high because Benedict had offended many in the Muslim world a few months earlier with a speech in Regensburg, Germany that was widely interpreted as linking Islam and violence.",
      "The Vatican added a visit to the Blue Mosque at the last minute in a bid to reach out to Muslims, and Benedict was warmly welcomed. He observed a moment of silent prayer, head bowed, as the imam prayed next to him, facing east.",
      "Benedict later thanked him \"for this moment of prayer\" for what was only the second time a pope had visited a mosque, after St. John Paul II visited one briefly in Syria in 2001.",
      "There were no doubts in 2014 when Pope Francis visited the Blue Mosque: He stood for two minutes of silent prayer facing east, his head bowed, eyes closed and hands clasped in front of him. The Grand Mufti of Istanbul, Rahmi Yaran, told the pope afterwards, \"May God accept it.\"",
      "The pope's planned itinerary and the Vatican spokesman had said in advance of the trip that Leo would pause for a prayer as his predecessors had done in the towering 17th-century mosque. But Leo merely toured the mosque.",
      "The Vatican had initially reported the visit went ahead as foreseen. But it subsequently revised the record to say he visited \"in a spirit of contemplation and listening, with deep respect for the place and the faith of those who gather there in prayer.\"",
      "There were other changes to the mosque visit, as well.",
      "The Vatican had initially said the head of the Diyanet religious affairs directorate would welcome Leo at the mosque. But the director, Safi Arpagus, wasn't there, and a spokesman for the Diyanet said Arpagus hadn't been expected, noting that he met with Leo upon his arrival Thursday in Ankara.",
      "The Vatican didn't explain the discrepancy. Leo was welcomed instead by the Turkish culture and tourism minister and several imams.",
      "Pope Leo prays at the church of the leader of Orthodox Christians",
      "Pope Leo XIV did pray at the patriarchal church in Istanbul of the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians in another gesture of unity.",
      "In the elaborate Church of St. George, Leo attended the doxology alongside Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The doxology is a short hymn of praise and glory to God that is sung by Christians.",
      "Leo said he was certain the \"encounter will also help to strengthen the bonds of our friendship.\"",
      "Eastern and Western churches split in the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope. Leo and popes before him have vowed to work to unite Christians again.",
      "Bartholomew, for his part, noted the significance that Leo chose to open his pontificate with his visit to Turkey.",
      "The main reason of the visit was to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, the unprecedented gathering of bishops that produced a creed, or proclamation of faith, that is still recited by millions of Christians today.",
      "Hagia Sophia left off itinerary",
      "Past popes have also visited the nearby Hagia Sophia landmark, once one of the most important historic cathedrals in Christianity and a United Nations-designated world heritage site.",
      "But Leo left that visit off his itinerary on his first trip as pope. In July 2020, Turkey converted Hagia Sophia from a museum back into a mosque, a move that drew widespread international criticism, including from the Vatican.",
      "After the mosque visit, Leo held a private meeting with Turkey's Christian leaders at the Syriac Orthodox Church of Mor Ephrem. In the afternoon, he was expected to pray with the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew, at the patriarchal church of Saint George.",
      "There, they were to sign a joint statement. The Vatican said in his remarks to the patriarchs gathered, Leo reminded them \"that division among Christians is an obstacle to their witness.\"",
      "He pointed to the next Holy Year to be celebrated by Christians, in 2033 on the anniversary of Christ's crucifixion, and invited them to go to Jerusalem on \"a journey that leads to full unity.\"",
      "Leo will end the day with a Catholic Mass in Istanbul's Volkswagen Arena for the country's Catholic community, who number 33,000 in a country of more than 85 million people, most of whom are Sunni Muslim. Crowds of devout Catholics braved pouring rain and tight security measures for the event.",
      "Maria Banasik waited for her friends at a cafe near the arena, four hours ahead of the scheduled Mass, saying they were excited to be part of Leo's first overseas visit.",
      "\"In the global situation now, his visit is of great importance,\" said Banasik, a Polish national who lives in Ankara.",
      "The Airbus software update doesn't spare pope",
      "While Leo was focusing on bolstering relations with Orthodox Christians and Muslims, trip organizers were dealing with more mundane issues.",
      "Leo's ITA Airways Airbus A320neo charter was among those caught up in the worldwide Airbus software update, ordered by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The order came after an analysis found the computer code may have contributed to a sudden drop in the altitude of a JetBlue plane last month.",
      "The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said Saturday that ITA was working on the issue. He said the necessary component to update the aircraft was on its way to Istanbul along with the technician who would install it.",
      "Leo is scheduled to fly from Istanbul to Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday afternoon for the second leg of his inaugural trip as pope.",
      "Lebanon increased security measures ahead of his visit. The Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday that trucks will be banned from entering the capital, Beirut, and the governorate of Mount Lebanon as of Sunday morning until Tuesday night. Trucks delivering food, water and fuel tankers as well as garbage trucks, will be excluded from the ban. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Michel Menassa issued an order banning anyone from carrying weapons in the same areas as of midnight Saturday for three days.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah welcomed the pontiff's trip to the crisis-hit nation, saying the group is committed to the country's religious coexistence, democratic accord and preserving its security. Hezbollah is allied with several Christian groups in the country, including the Free Patriotic Movement and Marada Movement.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades has raised questions about corruption and negligence in the renovations of the apartment complex where at least 128 people died.",
      "An intense fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court complex in Hong Kong's northern suburbs Wednesday afternoon, with flames covering seven of the eight towers. The complex was home to some 4,800 residents, some of whom had raised safety concerns about the renovations more than year before the fire.",
      "Police on Wednesday arrested three men from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. They were released on bail but then arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the authority said Saturday night, pointing to their leadership role in the renovations. ICAC had\u00a0also previously arrested\u00a0previously arrested seven men and one woman associated with the project.",
      "Police have not identified the company where the suspects worked, but documents posted to the homeowners association's website showed that the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company was in charge of renovations. Police have seized boxes of documents from the company, where phones rang unanswered Thursday.",
      "Officials also said they were investigating the materials used, both the netting on the scaffolding and the foam panels covering windows, and their role in the blaze.",
      "Residents highlighted safety issues a year before fire",
      "For almost a year, some residents at the Wang Fuk Court complex had been raising safety concerns to Hong Kong authorities about the scaffolding materials being used in the renovation project, according to documents reviewed by the AP, specifically about the netting that covered the scaffolding.",
      "Hong Kong's labor department in a statement on Saturday confirmed it had received such complaints, adding that officials had carried out 16 inspections of Wang Fuk Court's renovation project since July 2024, and had warned contractors multiple times in writing that they must ensure they met fire safety requirements. The city even carried out an inspection as late as one week before the fire.",
      "The labor department said it had reviewed the product quality certificate of the netting and that it was in line with standards, but that the safety netting had not been the previous target of inspections.",
      "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings. It then spread rapidly as the foam panels caught fire, said Chris Tang, the city's secretary for security. Police also said they had been looking at the highly flammable foam panels.",
      "\"The blaze ignited the foam panels, causing the glass to shatter and leading to a swift intensification of the fire and its spread into the interior spaces,\" Tang said.",
      "The labor department said later on Saturday that three prosecutions were brought against the company over breaches of safety regulations for working at height in the construction and convictions in two of the cases resulted in fines of totaling 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $3,850. The company also was fined three times in 2023 for separate violations unrelated to the Tai Po project.",
      "First responders also found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, said Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services. He did not specify how many were not working or if any of the others were.",
      "Intense blaze took days to put out",
      "It took firefighters a day to bring the fire under control, and it was not fully extinguished until Friday morning \u2014 some 40 hours after it started.",
      "Crews prioritized apartments from which they had received emergency calls during the blaze but were unable to reach in the hours that the fire burned out of control, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services, told reporters.",
      "Twelve firefighters were among the 79 people injured in the blaze, and one firefighter was killed.",
      "Even two days after the fire began, smoke continued to drift out of the charred skeletons of the buildings from the occasional flare-up.",
      "More bodies may be found",
      "While more bodies might be recovered, authorities said, crews have finished their search for anyone living trapped inside.",
      "Authorities said Saturday they need to identify 44 more bodies out of the 128 recovered. About 150 people remain unaccounted for.",
      "The dead included two Indonesian migrant workers, the Indonesian foreign ministry said Thursday. About 11 other migrants from the country who were working as domestic helpers in the apartment complex remain missing, Indonesian Consul General Yul Edison said Friday.",
      "Near the site of the fire, Sara Yu held the hand of her 2-year-old son, Dominic, as they each placed a single white rose into a growing cluster of the flowers in a small children's playground.",
      "\"I brought the kids here because I want them to understand that living in this world is something to be cherished,\" she said, holding back tears.",
      "Outside a building close to the scene of the fire where family members came to identify loved ones from photographs, people placed bouquets of white roses, lilies and carnations. \"More than 128 innocent lives, what did they do wrong?\" asked a sign placed among the flowers.",
      "The city lowered flags to half staff in mourning, and Chief Executive John Lee, led a three-minute silence Saturday from the government headquarters with officials all dressed in black.",
      "The fire was the deadliest in Hong Kong in decades. A 1996 fire in a commercial building in Kowloon killed 41 people. A warehouse fire in 1948 killed 176 people, according to the South China Morning Post.",

      "Two national agencies investigating a $100 million energy sector corruption scandal involving top Ukrainian officials in the country said they had searched Yermak's office.",
      "President Zelenskyy announced Yermak's resignation in a video message, where he said he didn't want there to be \"any questions about Ukraine.\"",
      "\"I want there to be no rumors and speculation,\" he added.",
      "Yermak himself \u2014 a powerful figure in Ukraine and a key participant in ongoing talks with the U.S., as the Trump administration pushes for a ceasefire to end Russia's nearly four-year war on the country \u2014 also confirmed that authorities had searched his apartment.",
      "\"The investigators are facing no obstacles,\" Yermak wrote in a post on the messaging app Telegram. He added that he was cooperating fully with them and his lawyers were present.",
      "The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office are Ukrainian anti-corruption watchdogs.",
      "Two of Yermak's former deputies \u2014 Oleh Tatarov and Rostyslav Shurma \u2014   left the government in 2024 after watchdogs investigated them for financial wrongdoing. A third deputy, Andrii Smyrnov, was investigated for bribes and other wrongdoing but still works for Yermak.",
      "The scandal has heaped more problems on Zelenskyy as he seeks continued support from Western countries for Ukraine's war effort and tries to ensure continued foreign funding. The European Union, which Ukraine wants to join, has told Zelenskyy he must crack down on corruption.",
      "Zelenskyy faced an unprecedented rebellion from his own lawmakers earlier this month after investigators published details of their energy sector investigation.",
      "In July, Zelenskyy faced the first major protests against himself and his government since Russia launched its full-scale invasion over a bill he signed into law giving Ukraine's prosecutor general, a political appointee roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general, more power over the two anti-corruption agencies.",
      "Some critics argued that the new law was political retribution following the charges being filed against his former deputy Smyrnov, and the move fueled concern that Ukraine could backslide into some degree of the authoritarianism that was the default under former, pro-Russian President\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "Although Yermak has not been accused of any wrongdoing, several senior lawmakers in Zelenskyy's party said Yermak should take responsibility for the energy sector scandal in order to restore public trust. Some said that if Zelenskyy didn't fire him, the party could split, threatening the president's parliamentary majority. But Zelenskyy defied them.",
      "The president urged Ukrainians to unite and \"stop the political games\" in light of the U.S. pressure to reach a settlement with Russia.",
      "Yermak met Zelenskyy over 15 years ago when he was a lawyer venturing into the TV production business and Zelenskyy was a famous Ukrainian comedian and actor. He oversaw foreign affairs as part of Zelenskyy's first presidential team and was promoted to chief of staff in February 2020.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 15:38:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Hong Kong authorities say almost 130 people have been confirmed dead in the massive fire that charred an apartment complex and took two days to put out.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong\u00a0\u2014 The death toll from a fire that tore through a Hong Kong residential complex climbed to 128 on Friday as more bodies were found in the blackened towers, authorities said. Meanwhile, another eight people involved in the towers' renovation were arrested.",
      "Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters at the scene that the search for victims was continuing and the death toll could still rise. The fire at the Wang Fuk Court complex started Wednesday afternoon and was only fully extinguished Friday morning. Dozens of people, including firefighters, were injured in the blaze.",
      "Firefighters were still combing through the high-rise complex apartment-by-apartment in a final attempt to find anyone alive after the massive fire engulfed seven of the complex's eight towers in one of the city's deadliest blazes ever recorded.",
      "Crews were prioritizing apartments from which they had received more than two dozen calls for assistance during the blaze, but which they were unable to reach due to the intensity of the fire, Derek Armstrong Chan, a deputy director of Hong Kong Fire Services told reporters early Friday morning.",
      "\"Our firefighting operation is almost complete,\" he said.",
      "The fire started midafternoon Wednesday in one of the Wang Fuk Court complex's eight towers, jumping rapidly from one to the next as bamboo scaffolding covered in netting, in place for renovations, caught ablaze until seven buildings were engulfed.",
      "It took more than 1,000 firefighters some 24 hours to bring the five-alarm blaze under control, and almost two days later, smoke still continued to drift out of the charred skeletons of the buildings from the occasional flare-up.",
      "The final search of the buildings was expected to be complete later Friday, at which point officials have said they will officially end the rescue phase of the operation at the complex in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near Hong Kong's border with mainland China.",
      "It was unclear how many people could be inside the buildings, which had almost 2,000 apartments and some 4,800 residents. Hong Kong leader John Lee said early Thursday morning that officials had not been able to make contact with 279 residents.",
      "\"We will endeavor to force entry into all the units of the seven blocks concerned so as to ensure that there is no other possible casualties,\" Chan said.",
      "He said an updated figure on the number of missing people could not be calculated until the search and rescue operation was complete.",
      "The apartments from which a total of 25 unanswered rescue calls were received, which are being prioritized, were primarily on higher floors, where the fire was last extinguished, he said.",
      "More than 70 people were injured in the blaze, including 11 firefighters, and about 900 people were housed in temporary shelters.",
      "Most of the casualties were in the first two buildings to catch fire, Chan said.",
      "Arrests amid investigation into the deadly blaze",
      "The apartment complex housed many older people. It was built in the 1980s and had been undergoing a major renovation. Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency said on Thursday it was investigating possible corruption relating to the renovation project.",
      "Authorities on Friday arrested seven men and one woman, ranging in age from 40 to 63, including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consultant company and project managers supervising the renovation, the Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement.",
      "On Thursday, three men, the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, and police said company leaders were suspected of gross negligence.",
      "Police have not identified the company where the suspects worked, but The Associated Press confirmed Prestige Construction & Engineering Company was in charge of renovations in the tower complex. Police have seized boxes of documents from the company, where phones rang unanswered Thursday.",
      "Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, allowing the unusually fast spread of the fire. There was also word on Friday that fire alarm systems in at least some of the buildings affected may not have been functioning properly.",
      "Police also said they found plastic foam panels - which are highly flammable - attached to the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower. The panels were believed to have been installed by the construction company but the purpose was not clear.",
      "Authorities planned immediate inspections of many housing estates undergoing major renovations to ensure scaffolding and construction materials meet safety standards.",
      "The fire was the deadliest in Hong Kong in decades. A 1996 fire in a commercial building in Kowloon killed 41 people.",

      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",

A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:59:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A deadly blaze ripped through bamboo scaffolding on a multi-tower housing estate in Hong Kong, killing dozens of people and leaving hundreds more missing.",
    "story": [
      "Police in Hong Kong\u00a0have arrested three men from a construction company on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with a blaze that has killed at least 94 people and left hundreds of others missing in the city's deadliest fire in years.",
      "The fire that started Wednesday afternoon spread across seven of the complex's eight buildings, though the blazes on four of the towers were under control by morning, the city's fire services said.",
      "Officials said at least 70 people were injured, including 11 firefighters, with many suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters overnight.",
      "Fire Services Department Director Andy Yeung said a firefighter was among the dead, and that the 37-year-old had been a firefighter for nine years. \"All of our colleagues are deeply saddened by the loss of such a devoted comrade,\" he said in a news release.",
      "As firefighters fought for a second day to extinguish the blaze, rescuers holding flashlights were going from apartment to apartment at the charred towers as thick smoke poured out from some windows at the Wang Fuk Court complex, a dense cluster of buildings housing thousands of people in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near Hong Kong's border with the mainland.",
      "Officials said firefighters were still working on a handful of apartments and trying to enter all of the units in the seven towers to ensure there were no further casualties.",
      "\"Our firefighting operation is almost complete,\" said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Services Operations. Firefighters were working hard \"to prevent the debris and embers from flaring up. What's next is the search and rescue operation,\" he added.",
      "It was unclear how many people remained missing or trapped. Hong Kong leader John Lee said contact had been lost with 279 people early Thursday. Authorities did not provide updates on the missing people or how many were still inside the ravaged buildings Thursday during a news conference.",
      "Video showed rescuers searching in some apartments in the dark. Orange flames were still seen from inside several windows, though the whole complex was now largely a blackened ruin.",
      "It was not immediately known how the fire started, but officials said the flames started on the external scaffolding on one of the buildings, a 32-story tower, and later spread inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.",
      "The raging fire sent up a column of flames and thick smoke as it spread through the bamboo scaffolding that had been set up around the exterior of the complex. Live video from the scene showed firefighters aiming water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks as the skies darkened, with smoke billowing from windows and red-hot embers falling to the ground.",
      "Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations.",
      "Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, as the rapid spread of the fire was unusual.",
      "Police also said they found foam materials that are highly flammable outside the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower, believed to be installed by a construction company.",
      "\"We have reason to believe that those in charge of the construction company were grossly negligent,\" said Eileen Chung, a senior superintendent of police. The three men arrested, aged 52 to 68, are the directors and an engineering consultant of the firm.",
      "The blaze was first reported in the mid-afternoon and was upgraded by nightfall  to a level-5 alarm, the highest level of severity, the Fire Services Department said.",
      "Firefighters deployed more than 140 fire trucks and more than 60 ambulances to the scene.",
      "Police said they received multiple reports of people trapped in the affected buildings. Records show the housing complex consisted of eight blocks with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 people. It was built in the 1980s and had recently been undergoing a major renovation.",
      "Lo Hiu-fung, a Tai Po District Council member, told local TV station TVB earlier Wednesday that most of the residents trapped in the fire were believed to be elderly people.",
      "\"Nearby residents please stay indoors and close doors and windows and stay calm and avoid going to areas affected by fire incidents,\" the Hong Kong Fire Services Department wrote on Facebook.",
      "Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Tai Po is a suburban area in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.",
      "The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level 5 fire that lasted for around 20 hours.",

      "Snapped last month by the Gemini South telescope \u2014 half of the International Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a mountain in Central Chile \u2014 the aptly named Butterfly Nebula is 2,500 to 3,800 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "At the heart of this bipolar nebula is a white dwarf star that cast aside its outer layers of gas long ago. The discarded gas forms the butterfly-like wings billowing from the aging star, whose heat causes the gas to glow.",
      "Students in Chile chose this astronomical target to celebrate 25 years of operation by the International Gemini Observatory.",
      "\"This picturesque object was chosen as a target for the 8.1-meter [26.5-foot] telescope by students in Chile as part of the Gemini First Light Anniversary Image Contest,\" NoirLab wrote on its website. \"The contest engaged students in the host locations of the Gemini telescopes to celebrate the legacy that the International Gemini Observatory has built since its completion, marked by Gemini South's First Light in November 2000.\"",
      "It's not known exactly when NGC 6302 was discovered, NoirLab says, but a 1907 study by American astronomer Edward E. Barnard is often credited. Scottish astronomer James Dunlop could also have discovered it in 1826.",

    "story": [
      "A rare crystal and diamond Faberg\u00e9 egg crafted for Russia's ruling family before it was toppled by revolution is going up for auction, valued at more than $26 million.",
      "Christie's auction house says the Winter Egg\u00a0is just one of seven of the opulent ovoids remaining in private hands. It will be offered for sale at Christie's London headquarters on Tuesday.",
      "The 4-inch-tall egg is made from finely carved rock crystal, covered in a delicate snowflake motif wrought in platinum and 4,500 tiny diamonds. It opens to reveal a removable tiny basket of bejewelled quartz flowers symbolizing spring.",
      "Margo Oganesian, the head of Christie's Russian art department, likened it to a luxurious Kinder Surprise chocolate.",
      "The Winter Egg is a superb example of craft and design, \"the 'Mona Lisa' for decorative arts,\" Oganesian said.",
      "One of just two created by female designer Alma Pihl, the egg was commissioned by Czar Nicholas II for his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, as an Easter present in 1913. Pihl's other egg is owned by Britain's royal family.",
      "Craftsman Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 and his company created more than 50 of the eggs for Russia's imperial family between 1885 and 1917, each elaborately unique and containing a hidden surprise. Czar Alexander III started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to his wife and mother.",
      "The Romanov royal family ruled Russia for 300 years before it was ousted by the 1917 revolution. Nicholas and his family were executed in 1918.",
      "Bought by a London dealer for 450 pounds when the cash-strapped Communist authorities sold off some of Russia's artistic treasures in the 1920s, the egg changed hands several times. It was believed lost for two decades until it was auctioned by Christie's in 1994 for more than 7 million Swiss francs ($5.6 million at the time). It sold again in 2002 for $9.6 million.",
      "Now it is expected to surpass the record $18.5 million paid at a 2007 Christie's auction for another Faberg\u00e9 egg created for the Rothschild banking family.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

      "Putin has previously demanded that Ukraine completely withdraw from the entirety of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions before Russia considers any sort of \"peace negotiations\" - notably including areas of each of those oblasts that Russia does not occupy. He also wants to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.",

      "The initial U.S. peace proposals appeared heavily skewed toward Russian demands, but an amended version emerged from talks in Geneva on Sunday between American and Ukrainian officials. Sidelined European leaders, fearing for their own security amid Russian aggression, are angling for deeper involvement in the process.",
      "Analysts say Putin is attempting to outwait the commitment of Western countries to supporting Ukraine's war effort. Trump has previously signaled he could walk away from efforts to stop the fighting if there is no progress.

      "The attack occurred at Crowdy Bay National Park, which is known for beach camping, fishing spots and hiking tracks 224 miles north of Sydney. The incident occurred just weeks after a shark\u00a0fatally mauled a surfer\u00a0at a beach off Sydney.",
      "Beaches in the area and to the north of the attack were closed to swimmers indefinitely, Police Chief Insp. Timothy Bayly said.",
      "Emergency services were called to Kylies Beach following reports that two people in their mid-20s had been bitten by a shark at 6:30 a.m., Bayly said.",
      "Bayly declined to detail the injuries or the circumstances of the attack. \"At this stage, all I'm prepared to say is they were known to each other and they were going for a swim and the shark attacked,\" Bayly told reporters.",
      "A bystander helped the pair on the beach before ambulance paramedics arrived, but the woman died at the scene.",
      "The man was flown by helicopter to a hospital, and paramedic Josh Smyth said the man's condition was serious but stable.",
      "Smyth said the bystander's first aid might have prevented a double fatality.",
      "\"I just really need to have a shoutout to the bystander on the beach who put a makeshift tourniquet on the male's leg which obviously potentially saved his life and allowed New South Wales Ambulance paramedics to get to him and render first aid,\" Smyth told reporters.",
      "Steven Pearce, Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive, described it as \"a really, really terrible incident.\"",
      "\"This area is so remote, there's no life guarding services up there at all,\" Pearce told local radio 2GB.",
      "The identities of the man and woman were not released.",
      "The Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs said the two were Swiss nationals. \"The Swiss Consulate General in Sydney is in contact with the local authorities and is supporting the relatives within the framework of consular protection,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Scientists had determined the couple had been attacked by a large bull shark, a state government statement said.",
      "Five drumlines - baited hooks suspended from floats - were deployed off Kylies Beach in an attempt to catch the shark, the government said.",
      "Drumlines had already been put in place to the north at Port Macquarie and to the south at Forster to reduce shark numbers.",
      "Gavin Naylor, director of the University of Florida's shark research program and manager of the International Shark Attack File database, said a single shark attacking more than one person was exceptionally rare.",
      "\"It is very unusual. Individual shark attacks are rare. And shark attacks on two people by the same individual is not unheard of, but it's very rare,\" Naylor said.",
      "Naylor said he would need to know details of the sequence of the shark's behavior Thursday to understand what had motivated it to bite.",
      "Two British tourists were attacked by a single shark while snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's northeast coast in 2019. One lost a foot and the other suffered leg injuries.",
      "There have been more than 1,280 shark incidents around Australia since 1791, of which more than 250 resulted in death, according to a database of the predators' encounters with humans.",
      "The International Shark Attack File, a database of global shark attacks run by the University of Florida, noted last year that a\u00a0\"disproportionate\" amount of people\u00a0died from shark bites in Australia in 2023 when compared with other countries around the world.",
      "A shark fatally mauled a surfer off a Sydney beach in September. The man, who left a wife and young daughter, lost \"a number of limbs\" and his surfboard was broken in two, police said.",
      "Earlier this month, an Australian windsurfer had a lucky escape after coming face-to-face with a shark off the country's west coast. A camera for the surf media website swellnet.com captured the moment that the shark seemingly came out of nowhere and knocked 61-year-old Andy McDonald off his board.",
      "\"Everything was really nice, and then just out of the blue, bang, something so hard and strong hit me like a freight train,\" McDonald told the Australian network ABC. \"It just pushed me up into the air and I fell into the, I fell into the water. I knew it was a shark.\"",

      "The first-ever American pope's first trip abroad started off with a distinctly American moment, when Pope Leo XIV was gifted a baseball bat formerly owned by Chicago White Sox legend Nellie Fox.",
      "CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay was among the 81 journalists on the papal flight to Turkey who were greeted by the pope during an unannounced stroll through the cabin to greet the Vatican press corps.",
      "Many on board continued the long-standing tradition of presenting gifts to the pontiff as a courtesy, but Livesay had a particularly personal gift for the Chicago native: a Louisville Slugger baseball bat that once belonged to Hall of Fame second baseman Nellie Fox \u2014 a Chicago White Sox legend whose career coincided with Leo's childhood.",
      "When the correspondent pointed out the initials and number on the end of the bat, which is a family heirloom given to Livesay by his cousin Jim Hayes (not Cardinals announcer Jim Hayes), the pope's eyes lit up.",
      "\"How did you get this through security?\" joked the pope \u2014 a big fan of the White Sox \u2014 prompting laughter from the surrounding journalists before he thanked Livesay for the gift.",
      "Other American journalists marked the Thanksgiving trip by offering Leo pumpkin and pecan pies.",
      "\"To the Americans: Happy Thanksgiving!\" he said at the start of the flight, before emphasizing the importance of truthful journalism and noting that his visit to Turkey and Lebanon was rooted in \"unity\" and promoting peace across religious divides.",
      "A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)",
      "Once the pope arrived in Ankara, the tone shifted to diplomacy and ceremony.",
      "After an official welcome at Esenboga International Airport, the Leo traveled 27 miles to the Ataturk Mausoleum, where he took part in a wreath-laying ceremony and signed the Book of Honor inside the Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee Tower, followed by a brief museum visit dedicated to the late founder of the Turkish Republic.",
      "The Ankara leg of Pope Leo's visit was to be brief. By Thursday evening, he's set to depart for Istanbul, where the spiritual heart of the papal visit will unfold over the coming days, including events tied to the anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, a pivotal gathering of bishops, summoned by then-Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325 A.D., which, among other things, set the date for Easter to be marked.",
      "From there, Leo will continue to Lebanon, a country facing deep political and economic turmoil.",
      "On Sunday, a top Hezbollah commander was killed in the capital Beirut, in a targeted strike by Israel just a week before the pope's visit to the city, underscoring security concerns on the ground.",

    "story": [
      "Two French prisoners escaped from jail after sawing through the bars of their cells and using bedsheets to get out of the facility, a prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Guards noticed the break-out shortly before dawn, the prisons' authority said. The facility is in the eastern city of Dijon.",
      "The pair \"seem to have sawn through bars\" and \"fled using bed sheets,\" Dijon prosecutor Olivier Caracotch said. He did not provide further details on how exactly they used the bedding.",
      "Union official Ahmed Saih, who represents prison officers at the facility, said the inmates used \"old-fashioned, manual saw blades\".",
      "The fugitives are a 19-year-old man held in pre-trial detention since October 2024 for attempted murder in a drug-related case, and a 32-year-old man incarcerated since 2023 over threats and violence against a partner, Caracotch said.",
      "\"Warning about the risk of a jail break for months\"",
      "The prison break comes 10 days after another escape in the western city of Rennes. A 37-year-old convict, who had more than year left to serve for theft, fled during an outing with fellow prisoners to the city's planetarium. It was not immediately clear if he had been caught. The prison's director was fired by Gerald Darmanin, France's justice minister who is pushing through a plan to lock up the most dangerous drug traffickers in supermax prisons.",
      "France has some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe, ranking third worst after Slovenia and Cyprus, according to a Council of Europe report published\u00a0in July. In early October, the national average was 135 inmates per 100 places available. Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "\"Prison is very hard here,\" an inmate released on Thursday after eight months, told AFP. \"There were three of us in a cell: two on bunk beds and one sleeping on the floor.\"",
      "Staff unions have complained that the state is neglecting normal jails as it moves narco criminals into new supermax prisons. Three prison directors' unions criticized Darmanin in a statement on Wednesday, before the Dijon escape. They accused him of \"devoting all the resources of a debt-ridden state\" to the high-security prisons for those accused of drug trafficking and jihadist attacks, and neglecting the \"vast majority\" of other jails.",
      "\"While the justice minister parades around in overfunded facilities, other (prison) services are suffering,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "Saih said there had been reports of saw blades found inside the Dijon prison, and that staff had \"been warning about the risk of a jail break for months.\" He called for more staff and better equipment, including \"gratings that cannot be sawn through.\"",
      "Darmanin last week announced the Dijon facility was scheduled to receive $7.3 million, as part of a program to eradicate mobile phones from six French prisons.",

    "story": [
      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

      "\"Thanks to the IJF for this long-awaited, fair and courageous decision,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The IJF said it had previously reinstated full national representation for Belarusian athletes. Belarus has allowed Moscow to use its territory as a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine, and later allowed the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear missiles on its soil.",
      "The IJF said it now considers it \"appropriate to allow the participation of Russian athletes under equal conditions,\" emphasizing that the sport \"cannot allow itself to become a platform for geopolitical agendas.\"",
      "\"Historically, Russia has been a leading nation in world judo, and their full return is expected to enrich competition at all levels while upholding the IJF's principles of fairness, inclusivity and respect,\" the federation said.",

      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",
      "\"We don't know -- it depends on what we find.\"",

      "A golden retriever is being lauded as \"the first responder\" who helped saved her owner's life when he suffered a cardiac arrest in the middle of the night.",
      "Hannah Cooke, from County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, was woken up one night last year by a bark from Polly, she and her husband's four-year-old dog, who the couple said normally sleeps quietly through the night.",
      "When she turned to her husband sleeping next to her, Hannah found him breathing irregularly, and then he stopped breathing entirely, according to the British Heart Foundation, which told the couple's story ahead of a ceremony on Tuesday that will see both Hannah and Polly crowned \"CPR Heroes\" for their actions.",
      "\"When I heard the noise Adam was making I sat bolt upright in bed, as I previously worked as a carer and it hit me that it was the same noise I've heard when people are taking their final breaths,\" said Hannah, 33.",
      "She immediately sprang into action, calling an ambulance and performing CPR on her husband until paramedics arrived to whisk him to the hospital. On the way, they shocked Adam seven times with a defibrillator before his heart rate normalized.",
      "Adam woke up at the hospital six days later and learned that he had been diagnosed with a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, which prevents the heart from pumping blood around the body effectively.",
      "After weeks of recovery and a procedure to have a Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator put in his chest, Adam was finally allowed to go home \u2014 where he was reunited with Polly.",
      "\"When I got out of hospital, I'll never forget seeing Polly again and knowing how she had intervened that night. I just cuddled her and cried for 20 minutes,\" Adam said.",
      "The couple credit Polly with having saved Adam's life by being \"in tune\" with him, and they believe she even knew what was happening.",
      "\"Polly alerted me, possibly within seconds of Adam's cardiac arrest, she was the first responder,\" Hannah told the BHF, a charity that raises awareness of cardiovascular disease and money to fund research into treatments and cures. \"Because of her, I was able to start CPR almost immediately.\"",

      "Even light activity helps the stomach process food and reduces the pressure that leads to heartburn. No matter how appealing it may seem, Shachner recommends avoiding the post-feast nap.",
      "4. Not knowing your triggers",
      "Some foods and drinks are more likely to cause trouble. Common triggers include fatty or fried dishes, tomato sauces, citrus, chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, coffee and carbonated drinks, according to the doctor.",

      "An occasional bout of heartburn isn\u2019t usually cause for concern, but if you\u2019re having symptoms two or more times a week, or if over-the-counter remedies stop working, the doctor said it's important to pay attention.",

Her Humanitarian Respite Center once processed more than 1,500 migrants per day at the height of mass crossings. She has been publicly praised by the Vatican for her humanitarian work and has spoken out against a return to the Remain in Mexico policy, saying families forced to wait in Mexico suffered \"tremendously.\"",

      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",

      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",

      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

Interruptions and wake-ups make up the last 20 points. These elements combine to show how close you came to your nightly sleep goals.",

      "High You may not have slept perfectly, but you got the sleep you needed. Your night was likely restorative and may still benefit your health over time.",

It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",

      "How the malware infiltrates devices",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

      "FBI WARNS OVER 1 MILLION ANDROID DEVICES HIJACKED BY MALWARE",
      "Strong antivirus software helps catch trouble early by spotting suspicious behavior before it harms your Android device or exposes your data. It checks apps as you install them, alerts you to risky permissions and blocks known malware threats. Many top antivirus options also scan links and messages for danger, which adds an important layer of protection when scams move fast.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "Data brokers quietly collect and sell your personal details, which helps scammers target you with more convincing attacks. A reputable data-removal service can find and delete your information from dozens of sites so that criminals have less to work with. This reduces spam, phishing attempts and the chances of ending up on a malware attack list.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Avoid downloading APKs from random websites, forwarded messages or social media posts. Most banking malware spreads through sideloaded apps that look official but contain hidden code. The Play Store is not perfect, but it offers scanning, app verification and regular take-downs that greatly reduce the risk of installing infected apps.",
      "System updates often patch security issues that attackers exploit to bypass protections. Updating your apps is just as important, since outdated versions may contain weaknesses. Turn on automatic updates so that your device stays protected without you having to check manually.",
      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes. If one password gets exposed, the rest of your accounts remain safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Once active, the malware can read your screen, steal financial data, automate crypto transfers and intercept OTPs within seconds. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "2FA adds a confirmation step through an OTP, authenticator app or hardware key. Even if attackers steal your login details, they still need this second step to get in. It cannot stop malware that takes over your device, but it significantly limits how far an attacker can go with stolen credentials.",
      "GOOGLE ISSUES WARNING ON FAKE VPN APPS",
      "Malware often abuses permissions such as Accessibility or Device Admin because they allow deep control over your phone. Check your settings to see which apps have these permissions and remove anything that looks unfamiliar. Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "A U.S. neurotechnology startup called Paradromics is gaining momentum in the fast-growing field of brain-computer interfaces. The FDA has approved its first human trial built to test whether its fully implantable device can restore speech for people with paralysis. This milestone gives the Austin company a strong position in a competitive space, shaping the future of neural technology.",
      "Paradromics received Investigational Device Exemption status for the Connect-One Early Feasibility Study using its Connexus BCI. It is the first approved study to explore speech restoration with a fully implantable system. The research team wants to evaluate safety and see how well the device converts neural activity into text or a synthesized voice.",

      "BRAIN IMPLANT TURNS THOUGHTS INTO DIGITAL COMMANDS",
      "How the brain implant works",
      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",
      "If early results meet expectations, the trial could expand to ten people. Some participants may receive two implants to capture a richer set of signals.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Cyberguy reached out to Paradromics for comment and received the following statement:",
      "Researchers are testing whether Paradromics\u2019 fully implantable brain device can turn neural activity into real-time speech for people with paralysis. (Synchron)",
      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Paradromics is taking a careful but bold path toward practical BCI communication. The first stage is small but meaningful. It sets the foundation for devices that may restore speech with natural flow and faster response times. As more trials move forward, this field could shift from experimental to everyday use faster than many expect.",

      "A fast follow to other major Microsoft credential attacks",
      "QRR appeared soon after Microsoft disrupted a major phishing network known as RaccoonO365. That service sold ready-made Microsoft login copies used to steal more than 5,000 sets of credentials, including accounts tied to over 20 US healthcare organizations. Subscribers paid as little as $12 a day to send thousands of phishing emails.",
      "Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit later shut down 338 related websites and identified Joshua Ogundipe from Nigeria as the operator. Investigators tied him to the phishing code and a crypto wallet that earned more than $100,000. Microsoft and Health-ISAC have since filed a lawsuit in New York that accuses him of multiple cybercrime violations.",
      "Other recent examples include kits like VoidProxy, Darcula, Morphing Meerkat and Tycoon2FA. QRR builds on these tools with automation, bot filtering and a dashboard that helps attackers run large campaigns fast.",
      "What makes QRR so effective",
      "QRR uses about 1,000 domains. Many are real sites that were parked or compromised, which helps the pages pass as legitimate. The URLs also follow a predictable pattern that can look normal to users at a glance.",
      "The kit includes automated filtering that detects bots. It sends scanners to harmless pages and sends real people to the credential-harvesting site. Attackers can manage campaigns inside a control panel that logs traffic and activity. These features let them scale up quickly without technical skill.",
      "Security analysts say organizations can no longer depend on URL scanning alone. Layered defenses and behavioral analysis have become essential for spotting threats that use domain rotation and automated evasion.",

      "How OpenTable gathers this information",
      "OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.",
      "This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.",
      "Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.",

      "Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.",
      "OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.",
      "THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU",
      "How the AI works",
      "OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like \"glass of cabernet\") to consistently categorize them as \"red wine,\" \"white wine,\" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.",
      "The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.",
      "A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable\u2019s Pro tools. (iStock)",
      "\"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,\" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. \"These insights come from a mix of sources \u2014 including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners \u2014 and are limited to non-confidential information.\"",
      "\"They might help a server suggest a dish you\u2019ll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,\" the representative said. \"We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You\u2019re in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you\u2019ve made in your privacy preferences.\"",
      "What data gets shared and how to limit it",
      "If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.",

      "Security researcher Cody Kociemba uncovered this quiet data flow after digging into the backend as part of a repair bounty challenge run by FULU, a right-to-repair group cofounded by electronics repair expert and YouTuber Louis Rossmann. The challenge asked developers to restore lost smart features for unsupported Nest devices. Kociemba teamed up with the open-source community and created No Longer Evil, software that brings smart functionality back to these aging thermostats.",

      "Kociemba says the volume of logs was extensive. He turned off the incoming data because he never expected the devices to remain connected to Google after the shutdown.",
      "Google previously said unsupported models will \"continue to report logs for issue diagnostics.\" However, Kociemba points out that Google cannot use that data to help customers anymore because support is fully discontinued. That makes the continued data flow even more puzzling.",

      "\"The Nest Learning Thermostat (1st and 2nd Gen) is no longer supported in the Nest and Home apps, but temperature and scheduling adjustments can still be made directly on the unit. These devices will soon be unpaired and removed from all user accounts. Diagnostic logs, which are not tied to a specific user account, will continue to be sent to Google for service and issue tracking. Users who prefer to stop providing these logs can simply disconnect their device from Wi-Fi via the on-device settings menu.\"",
      "The thermostats continue reporting temperature, motion and light data even though official support has ended.",
      "Why this discovery matters",
      "Google cut access to remote control, security updates, software updates and status checks through the Nest and Google Home apps. Owners can no longer rely on the devices for key smart features. Yet the thermostats still push data to Google, creating a one-way connection that helps the company more than the customer.",
      "Users do not benefit from the logs because support has been discontinued. Google cannot use these logs to diagnose problems or offer help. That raises questions about transparency and user choice for people who assumed the connection ended.",

      "Start by checking what Google has linked to your home devices. Visit myactivity.google.com and look for thermostat logs or events you do not expect.",
      "A guest network keeps the thermostat away from your main devices. This limits what the thermostat can reach and helps prevent broader access.",
      "Some routers let you stop individual devices from sending data to the internet. This cuts off log uploads while still letting the thermostat control heating and cooling.",
      "If the device menu still offers cloud settings, turn off anything related to remote access or online diagnostics. Even partial controls help reduce data flow.",
      "Check your connected devices in your Google settings. Remove any old Nest entries that no longer serve a purpose. This stops leftover links that may still send data.",
      "Some routers send analytics back to the router maker. Turn off cloud diagnostics to reduce the footprint of unsupported smart products.",

      "Smartphone banking has made life easier, but it has also opened new opportunities for cybercriminals.",
      "Over the past few years, we have seen Android malware steal passwords, intercept OTPs and even take remote control of phones to drain accounts. Some scams focus on fake banking apps, while others rely on phishing messages that trick you into entering sensitive details.",
      "Security researchers have now discovered a new threat that goes a step further. Instead of simply stealing login information, this malware gives thieves the ability to walk up to an ATM and withdraw your money in real time.",

      "Android malware like NGate tricks users into downloading fake banking apps that steal sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",
      "MANAGE ANDROID APPS WITH THE NEW 'UNINSTALL' BUTTON",
      "Once installed, the malware captures NFC tap-to-pay codes and PINs the moment the victim uses their phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What attackers do with the stolen data at the ATM",
      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",

      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches.

If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

      "German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul warned Tuesday that new intelligence assessments show Moscow is preparing for the option of a future attack against a NATO member, marking it the third time this month that senior German officials have raised alarms about a potential confrontation with Russia in the next 4 years.",
      "\"Putin eyes the EU and NATO. Our intelligence services are issuing urgent warnings: at the very least, Russia is creating the option for itself to wage war against NATO by 2029. We have to deter further Russian aggression, together with our partners and allies,\" the official German foreign ministry X account stated.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said he agreed with the severity of the German assessments. \"I believe there is a lot of truth in what the foreign minister is saying. Russia's intent for Eastern Europe is very clear.\"",
      "Breedlove noted that many observers have forgotten Russia\u2019s early signals before the full-scale invasion. \"At the beginning of this large-scale invasion phase, Russia gave us two documents. They call them treaties. We never acknowledged them. We continued to call them documents\u2026 Essentially, Mr. Putin said, \u2018Sign these or there will be other means\u2026\u2019 And we did not sign them. And we learned what \u2018or else\u2019 meant. And he came crashing into Ukraine for the third time. First was in Crimea. Second was in the Donbas, and now the third time in multiple axes.\"",
      "Breedlove said Putin\u2019s ambitions extend far beyond Ukraine. \"If you read those two documents, if you actually read them and I did multiple times, his intention is for all of Eastern Europe\u2026 he\u2019s going to rearrange the security architecture of Eastern Europe back to a Cold War status where he controls all those buffer countries and has this buffer between him and NATO.\"",

(AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky) (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky)",
      "Asked whether Russia could be ready to attempt such a move within five years, Breedlove said that depends on how quickly Moscow can rebuild its degraded forces. \"Ukraine has smashed his army, his army west of the Urals is deeply damaged\u2026 Is he able to rebuild this army?

      "The German foreign minister\u2019s warning follows separate comments from Germany\u2019s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that a war between Russia and NATO \"could begin in 2029,\" and that some analysts believe it could happen as early as 2028.

      "Washington has long debated whether the Brotherhood is a unified global movement or a loose network of national branches with different agendas and levels of militancy. That dispute stalled previous attempts to designate the group. Trump\u2019s order bypasses that debate and directs federal agencies to examine individual chapters that analysts say already meet the legal thresholds.",
      "Mariam Wahba, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in a statement that the directive \"replaces years of debate with concrete action\" and forces U.S. agencies to assess Brotherhood entities that function as \"real organizations with leadership structures, financing channels and documented ties to terrorist groups.\" She said the order \"treats Islamist actors according to their behavior, not their branding.\"",
      "Across the Arab world, the Brotherhood has been banned for years. Egypt outlawed it in 2013 after accusing the movement of radicalization and efforts to undermine state institutions. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates designated it soon after, calling it a direct threat to national stability. Bahrain issued similar findings. Jordan dissolved its local chapter this year following arrests tied to illicit weapons activity. Austria has also taken legal action against Brotherhood-linked networks as part of its counter-extremism framework.",

      "In the West, the Brotherhood operates far more freely. In the United States, Brotherhood-linked organizations function through charities, advocacy centers, mosques, student associations and community groups. This openness has raised concerns among counterterrorism officials, especially after a U.S. federal investigation in the early 2000s uncovered an internal Brotherhood memorandum describing its work in America as a long-term effort to influence and weaken Western institutions from within.",

      "The movement was founded in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna in Egypt after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Brotherhood promoted Islam\u2014according to experts\u2014as the solution to modern political crises and relied on outreach, services and media to expand its base. Influential thinkers like Sayyid Qutb later inspired jihadist movements such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group.",
      "Although the Brotherhood historically maintained a symbolic \"general guide\" in Egypt, the movement now operates as a decentralized network across the Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America. Wahba noted that this fragmentation explains why earlier U.S. attempts to impose a blanket designation failed. Instead, Trump\u2019s order adopts the model used when the United States designated Hamas, the Brotherhood\u2019s Gaza branch, in 1997: target the components \"that engage in violence, not the ideology itself.\"",
      "The decision also comes amid growing Israeli concern about a resurgent Islamist bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.

    "story": [
      "The day after Morgan Geyser cut off her ankle monitor and fled her group home, Illinois police unknowingly found her crouched against a wall at a truck stop two hours away Sunday night.",
      "Huddled next to her friend, Geyser told officers that she was worried about being separated from 43-year-old Chad Mecca, who was shaking from the cold and occasionally struggling to speak. The pair evaded questions about their identity as Geyser told officers that she had done \u201csomething really wrong.\u201d",
      "Geyser, 23, later \u201csuggested that officers could \u2018just Google\u2019 her name\u201d to find out who she is, according to the Posen Police Department incident report.",
      "An internet search would reveal that 11 years prior, Geyser stabbed her sixth-grade classmate, Payton Leutner, more than a dozen times with a kitchen knife to appease the fictional horror character \u201cSlender Man\u201d while their other friend, Anissa Weier, watched. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.",
      "The case spent years making national headlines and spawning documentaries as Geyser endured a prolonged court battle. A jury found that Geyser was mentally ill after her attorneys presented expert testimony that the girl was suffering from undiagnosed schizophrenia at the time of the stabbing. In an effort to avoid prison, Geyser agreed to a plea deal in 2017 that would have her institutionalized instead.",
      "Though she had been sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in a mental institution, Geyser had just been granted conditional release in January after spending seven years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Wisconsin. She fled the group home she\u2019d been placed in over fears of being separated from her friend, Mecca, according to body camera footage and police reports.",
      "Carrying a backpack and a pink journal with the words \u201chomeless couple\u2019s guidebook\u201d written in it, police allege, the two took a Greyhound bus from Wisconsin on Saturday night. They were eventually found more than 165 miles away in Illinois and arrested Sunday evening.",
      "Mecca was later released on a citation and is due to appear in court Jan. 15. NBC News was unable to reach Mecca; it is unclear whether Mecca has retained an attorney.",
      "At her extradition hearing Tuesday, Geyser was brought out in a blue jumpsuit and dark glasses. She waived her extradition and will be held in Cook County without bail.",
      "Wisconsin has a month to take Geyser back to the state. Waukesha County District Attorney Lesli Boese told reporters Monday that the state would have to decide whether to file a petition to revoke Geyser\u2019s conditional release, a move they would support, she said.",
      "The Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said on Monday that they had not received a referral regarding Geyser\u2019s case, but may receive one from the Madison Police Department \u201cat some point.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Geyser did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "An attack ordered by \u2018Slender Man\u2019",
      "The May 31, 2014, attack on Leutner began as a Saturday morning game of hide-and-seek in the woods of a suburban Milwaukee park.",
      "Then, prosecutors say, Geyser and Weier pinned down Leutner before Geyser stabbed her 19 times. The knife barely missed an artery near her heart, coming \u201cone millimeter away from certain death,\u201d the criminal complaint said.",
      "After the attack, Geyser and Weier fled the scene, leaving Leutner to die. The middle schooler managed to crawl out of the woods and find a bicyclist on a sidewalk. Geyser and Weier were arrested five hours after the attack, still armed with the knife.",
      "During the trial, Geyser\u2019s attorneys told the court that the girl had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which is why she believed the fictional horror character \u201cSlender Man\u201d was speaking to her. Geyser believed the boogeyman would harm their families if they didn\u2019t stab Leutner.",
      "Weier, who did not stab Leutner but was accused of \u201cegging\u201d Geyser on, pleaded guilty in 2017 to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide and was sentenced to 25 years in a mental hospital. She was released in 2021.",
      "Geyser was 15 when she was sentenced to decades in a mental institution, spending nearly seven years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute. In January, a judge ruled that she should be released to a group home.",
      "Three experts testified at the time that Geyser was no longer a threat to the public and had made considerable progress in her treatment.",
      "Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren upheld the conditional release plan in March after some objection from the district attorney\u2019s office, which had concerns that Geyser had sent violent artwork to a man. It appeared that Geyser had stopped contact with that individual, Bohren said in his decision.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t find that in and of itself a reason to find she\u2019s at risk for herself or at risk to harm the community in a conditional release plan,\u201d he said, adding that just because she participated in the contact \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean she encouraged it.\u201d",
      "Bohren also said that the group home would, in some ways, be \u201cmore strict\u201d than being institutionalized, given the \u201csubstantial supervision\u201d Geyser would be under.",
      "Details of Geyser\u2019s conditional release are sealed, but her attorney, Tony Cotton, had previously told the court that there was difficulty finding Geyser a place to land. A letter filed by Cotton in August said that a home in Sun Prairie declined to take Geyser due to the \u201cpublicity surrounding the placement.\u201d",
      "Disappearance from the group home",
      "Police say Geyser was last seen around Kroncke Drive at 8 p.m. Nov. 22 with another adult. A little over an hour later, the Department of Corrections became aware that Geyser had tampered with her monitoring bracelet. By 11:30 p.m., authorities learned that Geyser had removed the ankle bracelet and was not at the group home.",
      "By around 9 p.m. the next day, she was found at the truck stop more than 165 miles away in Illinois with Mecca, who was also arrested and charged with criminal trespass and obstructing identification, according to the Posen Police Department.",
      "Geyser told officers that she met Mecca at a Wisconsin church a couple of months ago and that she was upset Mecca was unable to visit her at the group home, according to the Posen police incident report. Geyser alleged that she was treated poorly at the home, and that Mecca visited her there on multiple occasions by \u201cclimbing her window and sneaking in.\u201d",
      "The Wisconsin Department of Health Services said it could not comment on Geyser, who is being treated at one of its facilities, because of patient privacy protections. The Department of Corrections is similarly limited when it has been contracted by health services for supervision and monitoring activities, it added.",
      "Geyser said Saturday that she and Mecca had taken the Greyhound bus from Wisconsin to Illinois and had discussed heading to Nashville, Tennessee, according to the incident report. It is not immediately clear what specifically motivated the two to leave Saturday.",
      "Body camera footage from Sunday night showed Geyser pleading with officers not to separate her from Mecca, asking if they would at least promise to let her say goodbye to Mecca \u201cno matter what I did.\u201d",
      "Geyser told officers in the footage that Mecca is transgender and repeatedly refers to Mecca using \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d pronouns.",
      "During the search, officers found the pink notebook in the backpack, according to the footage. One officer flipped through the journal and read out the words \u201chomeless couple\u2019s guidebook.\u201d",
      "Mecca told ABC affiliate WKOW that they prefer to go by the name \u201cCharly\u201d and that Geyser ran away because of the visitation restrictions. The two had developed a strong friendship after meeting at church months ago, Mecca told the news station.",
      "After their Sunday truck stop arrest, body camera footage showed Geyser and Mecca being transported through the interior cameras of separate patrol cars. Geyser remained silent throughout her ride and looked out the window quietly.",
      "An officer talked with Mecca during their ride, saying that his colleagues would get them meals. Mecca thanked the officer and appeared to be dejected.",
      "\u201cWe really do just wanna be on our way, we\u2019re sorry to have caused trouble,\u201d Mecca said.",
      "The officer then told Mecca they would send the pair on their way once they find out who they are. Mecca simply responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna happen.\""

      "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British playwright Tom Stoppard, a playful, probing dramatist who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998\u2019s \u201cShakespeare In Love,\u201d has died. He was 88.",
      "In a statement Saturday, United Agents said Stoppard died \u201cpeacefully\u201d at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\u201cHe will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language,\u201d they said. \u201cIt was an honor to work with Tom and to know him.\u201d",
      "The Czech-born Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\u201d in 1968; \u201cTravesties\u201d in 1976; \u201cThe Real Thing\u201d in 1984; \u201cThe Coast of Utopia\u201d in 2007; and \u201cLeopoldstadt\u201d in 2023.",
      "Stoppard biographer Hermione Lee said the secret of his plays was their \u201cmixture of language, knowledge and feeling. \u2026 It\u2019s those three things in gear together which make him so remarkable.\u201d",
      "The writer was born Tom\u00e1s Str\u00e4ussler in 1937 to a Jewish family in Zl\u00edn in what was then Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic. His father was a doctor for the Bata shoe company, and when Nazi Germany invaded in 1939 the family fled to Singapore, where Bata had a factory.",
      "In late 1941, as Japanese forces closed in on the city, Tomas, his brother and their mother fled again, this time to India. His father stayed behind and later died when his ship was attacked as he tried to leave Singapore.",
      "In 1946, his mother married an English officer, Kenneth Stoppard, and the family moved to threadbare postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \u201cput on Englishness like a coat,\u201d he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "He did not go to university but began his career, aged 17, as a journalist on newspapers in Bristol, southwest England, and then as a theater critic for Scene magazine in London.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \u201cA Walk on the Water,\u201d televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\u201d which reimagined Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters. A mix of tragedy and absurdist humor, it premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1966 and was staged at Britain\u2019s National Theatre, then run by Laurence Olivier, before moving to Broadway.",
      "A stream of exuberant, innovative plays followed, including meta-whodunnit \u201cThe Real Inspector Hound\u201d (first staged in 1968); \u201cJumpers\u201d (1972), a blend of physical and philosophical gymnastics, and \u201cTravesties\u201d (1974), which set intellectuals including James Joyce and Vladimir Lenin colliding in Zurich during World War I.",
      "Musical drama \u201cEvery Good Boy Deserves Favor\u201d (1977) was a collaboration with composer Andre Previn about a Soviet dissident confined to a mental institution \u2014 part of Stoppard\u2019s long involvement with groups advocating for human rights groups in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.",
      "He often played with time and structure. \u201cThe Real Thing\u201d (1982) was a poignant romantic comedy about love and deception that featured plays within a play, while \u201cArcadia\u201d (1993) moved between the modern era and the early 19th century, where characters at an English country house debated poetry, gardening and chaos theory as fate had its way with them.",
      "\u201cThe Invention of Love\u201d (1997) explored classical literature and the mysteries of the human heart through the life of the English poet A.E. Housman.",
      "Stoppard began the 21st century with \u201cThe Coast of Utopia\u201d (2002), an epic trilogy about pre-revolutionary Russian intellectuals, and drew on his own background for \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d (2006), which contrasted the fates of the 1960s counterculture in Britain and in communist Czechoslovakia.",
      "\u201cThe Hard Problem\u201d (2015) explored the mysteries of consciousness through the lenses of science and religion.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \u201cI burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\u201d",
      "Some critics found his plays more clever than emotionally engaging. But biographer Lee said many of his plays contained a \u201csense of underlying grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople in his plays \u2026 history comes at them,\u201d Lee said at a British Library event in 2021. \u201cThey turn up, they don\u2019t know why they\u2019re there, they don\u2019t know whether they can get home again. They\u2019re often in exile, they can barely remember their own name. They may have been wrongfully incarcerated. They may have some terrible moral dilemma they don\u2019t know how to solve. They may have lost someone. And over and over again I think you get that sense of loss and longing in these very funny, witty plays.\u201d",
      "That was especially true of his late play \u201cLeopoldstadt,\u201d which drew on his own family\u2019s story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother\u2019s death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have written about my heritage \u2014 that\u2019s the word for it nowadays \u2014 while my mother was alive, because she\u2019d always avoided getting into it herself,\u201d Stoppard told The New Yorker in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt would be misleading to see me as somebody who blithely and innocently, at the age of 40-something, thought, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I had no idea I was a member of a Jewish family,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I knew, but I didn\u2019t know who they were. And I didn\u2019t feel I had to find out in order to live my own life. But that wasn\u2019t really true.\u201d",
      "\u201cLeopoldstadt\u201d premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the Covid-19 pandemic. It eventually opened in Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \u201cParade\u2019s End\u201d (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \u201cBrazil\u201d (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \u201cEmpire of the Sun\u201d (1987), Elizabethan rom-com \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code-breaking thriller \u201cEnigma\u201d (2001) and Russian epic \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d (2012).",
      "He also wrote and directed a 1990 film adaptation of \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\u201d and translated numerous works into English, including plays by dissident Czech writer V\u00e1clav Havel, who became the country\u2019s first post-communist president.",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",
      "He was married three times: to Jose Ingle, Miriam Stern \u2014 better known as the health journalist Dr. Miriam Stoppard \u2014 and TV producer Sabrina Guinness. The first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by four children, including the actor Ed Stoppard, and several grandchildren."

      "The same night, Robert Irwin dedicated an emotional dance to Bindi Irwin, 27.",
      "During a challenge that asked couples to perform a routine from an earlier season of the show, Robert Irwin and Carson opted to perform the same foxtrot to \u201cFootprints in the Sand\u201d by Leona Lewis that his sister and Hough once performed.",
      "When she originally performed the dance, Bindi Irwin dedicated it to the sibling's late father.",

      "\"Maxton Hall\" finished its season on a major cliffhanger \u2014 but this time it's Ruby who's left in a heartbreaking lurch.",
      "The Prime Video German teen drama is beloved for its soapy plots, angsty relationship dynamics and powerful chemistry between leads James Beaufort (Damian Hardung) and Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten).",
      "But their enemies-to-lovers romance has brought plenty of strife to their lives due to the class difference between them (hence the subtitle, \"The World Between Us.\")",
      "If it wasn't clear from Season 1, Season 2 has firmly established that James' father, Mortimer (Fedja van Hu\u00eat), is the show's big bad. In the wake of the death of his wife \u2014 which was revealed in the last minutes of the Season 1 finale \u2014 his efforts to control his children, James and Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), only intensified.",
      "He circumvents their efforts to modernize the family's company, seemingly removes them from their mother's will and of course, tries force James and Ruby apart. First, by getting Ruby's scholarship rescinded, and then, by forcibly taking over the Bell family's bakery.",
      "But it's final manipulation that makes up Season 2's shocking final moments.",
      "What Happens at the End of 'Maxton Hall' Season 2?",
      "The final few moments of \"Maxton Hall\" Season upend all of Ruby's efforts to secure her future as a student at Oxford.",
      "In Episode 6, which dropped Nov. 28 on Prime Video, it's revealed that professor Graham Sutton (Eidin Jalali) has been having an affair with a student. Since Season 1, he's had on-again, off-again trysts with Lydia Beaufort, who's now pregnant with twins. He's summoned before school leaders, including Mortimer, to explain what happened.",
      "During that meeting, it's revealed the affair was discovered via a photo. (Remember: In Episode 5, Elaine (Eli Riccardi), who's in love with James, and Cyril (Ben Felipe), who's long pined for Lydia, discovered Lydia and Graham embracing in the woods during a school function and took a photo as evidence.)",
      "But when Graham sees the photo that started the inquest, it turns out to be a picture not of him and Lydia, but of him and Ruby from a school gala in Season 1.",
      "The scene then cuts to a meeting with Ruby, her mother and the headmaster. He tells her she's been suspended from Maxton Hall and will never attend Oxford.",
      "The final minutes of the show feature no dialogue, just an acoustic rendition of \"Chasing Cars.\"",
      "As Ruby walks out into the courtyard in tears, Lydia watches as Graham is escorted from Maxton Hall by police in handcuffs.",
      "Exchanging no words, James hugs a shell-shocked Ruby.",
      "Damian Hardung tells TODAY.com it's unclear what James understands is happening in that moment.",
      "\"What we see right now only is obviously, how beautifully Harriet has acted out that scene, and just seeing everything being destroyed, and just looking at her face and reading that off of her eyes,\" Hardung says. \"He's just in complete shock, but he doesn't know which direction to go.\"",
      "It's made more emotional because \" a moment before, everything was perfect,\" Hardung adds. After his character cheated on Ruby in Episode 1, James pursued therapy and finally, the couple seemed on a healthier, more secure relationship path.",
      "Herbig-Matten says throughout the season her character was \"in conflict with herself.\"",
      "\"She knows that she has to let him go, and that he has to fix himself and she's not responsible for his feelings and loss, and that he's getting back in these toxic behaviors or character traits,\" she says. (\"What do you mean?\" Hardung jokingly interjects.)",
      "She identifies the turning point for her character as James' speech in Episode 3. Filling in as a last minute speaker for Ruby's gala, James opened up about his mother's death and his mental health \u2014 even at the risk of his father's ire.",
      "\"She's deciding to give him a second chance, and I think I love that about her,\" Herbig-Matten says.",
      "But true to form, it all could fall apart after that finale.",
      "\"I think that's this roller coaster of 'Maxton Hall,'\" Hardung says. \"And a part of the reason why this show is so successful is because we just have such a dense high and low-point structure throughout the entire episodes.\"",
      "But Season 2 almost ended on a different scene entirely, the actors say.",
      "How the Season Was Originally Supposed to End",
      "Herbig-Matten and Hardung say originally, the show creators wanted to cut the scenes where she finds out about her expulsion and sobs to James.",
      "\u201cWe were all like, we need this ending,\u201d Herbig-Matten says. \u201cI need this ending for my character.\u201d",
      "They watched the show at a screening around June 2025, and \"it was ending on Graham ... seeing the photo,\" Hardung says.",
      "\"But then the audience wouldn't have known what does that mean to Ruby, what does that mean to the couple,\" Hardung adds.",
      "\"We saw it all on the screen. We're like, 'You can't do it,'\" he continues.",
      "After a \"whole conversation,\" they changed the ending to include the scenes of Ruby reacting.",
      "\"Now we got our ending back,\u201d Hardung says."

    "summary": "The members of 5 Seconds of Summer discuss their new album, \"Everyone's a Star!\", the inspiration and 15 years together.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time, when the members of Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer started to create their sixth album, they already knew what they wanted it to look and feel like.",
      "\"When you can see something in your head, it's more inspiring to get there,\" guitarist Michael Clifford says. \"You're not shooting in the dark like, 'I wonder what this is gonna be like?' You have an idea, and you can drive the ship there.\"",
      "The result was \"Everyone's A Star,\" which dropped Nov. 14. Arguably their most meta album yet, the 12 tracks \u2014 plus four bonus tracks on a deluxe edition that dropped Nov. 17 \u2014 discuss fame, self-destruction and the \"boyband\" culture they've at times rejected and embraced since the group formed in 2011.",
      "The album is less about the personal inspirations that defined their previous hits and more about a \"togetherness,\" says bassist Calum Hood\u00a0\u2014 fitting for a band that is still standing after each member has released at least one solo album.",
      "Below, 5 Seconds of Summer discuss new aspects to their sound, preparing for the \"Everyone\u2019s a Star! World Tour\" and the \"larger-than-life\" characters featured on their latest album \u2014 the band's first in three years.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Calum Hood: It's definitely not a singular conversation that we have at the start of every album. We don't all sit down together and be like, \"OK, what have we accomplished?\"",
      "I feel like we've lived so much life in this band, we intuitively know the different paths that we've taken. And it's very much an intuition-lead thing, moving into a new album process, examining what's happening in everyone's lives, and seeing where that collectively wants to go.",
      "Luke Hemmings: \"No. 1 Obsession\" was the first one. And that was like, \"OK, this feels like it's ticking all the boxes.\" It felt very 5SOS, reclaiming back a bit of that punk rock, garage spirit, but had lyrics that felt very eye catching, even though it's ear catching, I guess.",
      "And that was the one to beat for a while. It felt like a nice blueprint to go from there, because it takes a minute to figure out what the next album's sounds going to be like. You're sort of stabbing in the dark for a while \u2014 especially after the last album had a very specific sound and feeling to it. We love challenging that on the next album, trying to totally 180-flip ... (and saying) what does it feel like if we did the opposite?",
      "LH: Sonically, it has a lot of dance elements in it, like New York and London, Cassius, Prodigy, those dancier acts that still feel like they have a rawness to them. And it's mixed (with a sound) only 5SOS could do; ironic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but with lots of wisdom behind it. There's a little bit of social satire and self- deprecating humor in it. The sound is a mix of the pop rock, punk, garage band we started as, but mixed in with more dance element roots.",
      "That kind of sounds confusing as f---. (Laughs.) So I don't know.",
      "Michael Clifford: I don't think so.",
      "I think we're finally old enough \u2014\u00a0we're not old, sorry \u2014 we're young enough. We've been doing this for a minute, not too long, but we've been doing it for a little bit and we are able to understand a little bit more, just get perspective on things. I think that it was crucial for us to be able to have that perspective in order to make an album that has those types of themes in it.",
      "And like Luke said, trying to flip it on its head and trying to do the opposite of the last thing that we did, I think, was what we found so exciting about this.",
      "This has been the first time that we've really made an album knowing what we wanted it to look like and feel like in mind. We sort of had an idea of the theme and the feeling that we wanted this to evoke. So it made making it a lot easier and more inspiring. When you can see something in your head, sometimes it's more inspiring to get there because you're not shooting in the dark and like, \"I wonder what this is gonna be like?\" You kind of have an idea and you can drive the ship there.",
      "CH: It's definitely a cool feeling. These guys are kind of the only other three that can really resonate with my life's journey the last 15 years. I gain a lot of comfort from that. And it differs within our last albums, where a lot of the songs thematically come very personally. It's very personal-led, that's how we start songs. But this album felt more \u2014 there was a togetherness of the theme of the album and conceptually that felt really fresh and new. And there's definitely, subconsciously, a lot of healing from that, too.",
      "LH: I feel good. The last show we did, the \"Five Seconds of Summer Show,\" it felt like we unlocked our full evolution, or almost full evolution, as a band with mixing in the 10-year anniversary skits. It was more of treating it as an entertainment piece, as opposed to just ... (getting) out there and crank(ing) out some songs and play as a band. But it had multimedia and it was blurring the lines between the video and then the on-screen and onstage. It was really fun to do and it felt like the most \"us\" a show has been.",
      "So this time, because the characters that we have in this album, their egos are a bit more inflated, the show will reflect that. The people that have the big heads in \"Telephone Busy\" \u2014 those guys are making the show. They're behind the wheel and they're kind of crazy.",
      "MC: They've got some damage.",
      "LH: (Laughs.) It'll be like the 5SOS show we did but on steroids.",
      "MC: Not even steroids.",
      "LH: What's crazier than steroids?",
      "MC: Nothing that's appropriate to say on the TODAY show.",
      "CH: No, no, it's like Green Goblin-esque.",
      "LH: So if the Green Goblin was the fifth. Does that make any sense? (Laughs.)",
      "MC: I don't know. It's not as heady and narrative as that, but it sometimes made approaching concepts \u2014 and like Calum was saying \u2014 instead of going into the meaning of a song and being like, \"Do I personally resonate with this?\" It was more about like, \"Does my place within this story we're trying to tell, how do I embody that?\" Rather than trying to do anything that's too narratively driven. We always are going to be ourselves. We're just  ourselves in an alternate universe.",
      "LH: It's like the larger than life version of ourselves and we're back together. Especially after doing separate solo things, now together \u2014 we are like super, super 5SOS, I guess.",
      "CH: SuperSOS.",
      "MC: The conversation that we had behind it was like, we're our best, biggest versions of ourselves \u2014 well I'm the best, biggest version of myself when I'm doing my solo music \u2014\u00a0but also when I do the band's music. So they're the best versions of themselves when they're in the band.",
      "LH: This is a confusing read. (Laughs).",
      "CH: I agree, you're not your best version.",
      "MC: No, I said I am.",
      "LH: You're not your best version right now. (Laughs.)",
      "LH: We were telling people when we first started that we're going to be a band for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. And everyone, when you're 16 and 17, they're like, \"OK, cool,\" because usually the life cycle of a boy band is short. It's like a butterfly or something.",
      "MC: I think Ash has something to say as well.",
      "Ashton Irwin (mid-hair and makeup): What? ... Don't talk to me while I'm getting my makeup done.",
      "LH: You can legitimately quote that.",
      "I don't know if I'd tell (my younger self) anything. I'd just maybe, I'd just give him a soft drink. Maybe a cheeky pat on the back would be nice.",
      "CH: Maybe a foot-long Subway sandwich. Call it a day.",
      "LH: We've been telling people we're going to be a band for this long and I'm really happy that we stuck it out. We have a f------ amazing fan base that let us change and evolve and experiment with new sounds and looks and everything, and I still feel the same. And that's crazy to be some people's No. 1 obsession still. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a walking ghost.",
      "MC: Can I get a drink on the rocks?"

      "\u201cWe always did an enormous single table,\u201d Zevnik tells TODAY.com of her Thanksgiving dinners, attended by 40-plus guests at her ranch-style home in Bel Air, California. Formerly an actor, he worked as Taylor\u2019s chef from 1991 until 1999.",
      "Zevnik says, while he would typically only cook for her, holidays were a special case. As he prepared the feast, movers would remove all her furniture from her living and trophy rooms to make space for a square of banquet tables, which he says he also decorated.",
      "\u201cI would literally take off my shoes and have to get up there on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cI would do these very elaborate centerpieces with fabrics and vases of flowers and tchotchkes and candles.\u201d",
      "Taylor liked to seat all at the same table, he says, adding that kids, adults, celebrities and noncelebs all sat together, \u201cbecause then who gets to sit with her?\u201d",

      "Scroll to the bottom for his crispy turkey wing recipe.",

      "\u201cGenerally, we wouldn\u2019t make a whole lot of plans in advance,\u201d Zevnik says. He would arrive to cook during the day and provide her options \u201cprepped to a certain point,\u201d as well as her favorites that he could easily whip up.",
      "\u201cAt some point, she\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, what do we got today?\u2019\u201d he says. He would ask her what she was in the mood for: salty, crunchy, creamy, healthy, etc. \u201cThen we would go from there.\u201d",
      "Every afternoon, Zevnik says Taylor would have him cook for everyone working at the house. \u201cAll the staff would gather and sit down together in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Taylor was very open to trying new cuisines, but since she was brough up in the U.K., she especially loved British foods, like roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and Marmite.",

      "The Oscar winner portrays Phillip, a struggling middle-aged American living in Tokyo taking a number of small gigs in hopes of getting another big break. He then gets an opportunity with a business that forever changes his life: a \"rental family\" agency.",
      "Essentially, actors like Philip get paid to play stand-in roles in strangers' lives. They can get hired to pose as family members, friends, partners, people whom they've had affairs with and now must apologize to their spouses, or whomever the client needs.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is not based on a true story. However, it does bring to light the very real family rental businesses in Japan.",
      "Director Hikari tells TODAY.com that upon learning of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "The film shows an initially hesitant Phillip after he gets hired as a stand-in-fianc\u00e9 for a woman who wants to stage a wedding so she can move to a different country with her female partner.",
      "He is also \u201cbooked\u201d to fill in the role of a long-lost father for a young girl named Mia (Shannon Mahina Gorman). Her, mother Hitomi (Shino Shinozaki), believes if her daughter has a complete family, her chances at being accepted into a prestigious school will be better.",
      "Then, the daughter of an aging Japanese actor, Kikuo (Akira Emoto), hires Philip to pose as a journalist and interview him before he loses his memory. While he pretends to write a story about the former star, they begin to form a friendship.",
      "In 2018, director Hikari began exploring the \u201crent-a-family industry\u201d and discovered that it started in the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cCurrently there are about 300 companies that exist in Japan,\u201d the director said in press notes. \u201cIn a big city like Tokyo, or even a countryside town, you can feel so isolated. \u2026 Every single person I spoke to was looking for connection. Even though they\u2019re paying for the service, they find a friendship within that two or three hours they spend together. And the actors who become the surrogates, they are also 100% invested in the relationship and find their own connection in the community. The roles may seem fake but the emotion is real.\u201d",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Hikari recalls the moment she knew rental services were \u201creally doing something very important to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "There was a man that couldn\u2019t get in touch with his daughter for a long time, she says, \u201cand before he passed away, he really wanted to reconnect, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he hired somebody who looked like his daughter and asked her to come to the hospital so that he (could) apologize and say how much he loved her before he passed away,\u201d she says.",

The people that we\u2019ve spoken to who actually work in this industry have told us stories of how they get so much out of providing this service.\u201d",

      "Actor Takehiro Hira, who portrays Shinji, the owner of the rental family, calls the services a step to healing in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSometimes it becomes too much. Sometimes (they) just can\u2019t take it anymore. So rather than going to seek professional help... and you might be shy, then you can rent and use services like this to do the patchwork on the wound.\u201d",

But maybe on some lonely night she might feel (scared), so that sort of puts everything in context.\u201d",
      "Miwa Yasui, a University of Chicago professor who also researches how culture influences mental health, told AP that Japan has grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and mental illness stigma. Yasui noted that Japan as a collective culture tends to hide mental health challenges and adults are pressured to maintain harmony and take care of the family.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "Hikari's goal was to make audiences ask themselves the role they would hire someone to play in their lives, as well as share a reminder to connect with real people.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares with TODAY.com. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cNobody wants to work the Monday after the biggest game in football,\u201d Brady says in the commercial.",

      "\u201cGoing into work the day after the big game? Hard pass,\u201d Brady added in the release. \u201cA massive number of employees unexpectedly call out of work the day after the Big Game, creating a huge headache for businesses across the country and a drag on our economy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m deepening my partnership with Gopuff to tackle this problem head-on. Together, we\u2019re supporting The Super Monday Off Coalition and advocating for an official holiday after the Big Game.\u201d",
      "Making the Monday after the Super Bowl a national holiday is an idea that has been simmering for years, with a UKG poll earlier this year finding 43% of employed Americans saying should be.",
      "\u201cThe Big Game brings every single American together,\u201d said Yakir Gola, co-founder and co-CEO of Gopuff, in the press release. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Monday after the Big Game must become Super Monday \u2014 an official federal holiday that honors our love for competition, victory and the greatest country on Earth.",
      "\u201cBy supporting The Super Monday Off Coalition, we\u2019re putting real action behind a cultural truth. Now, the President and Congress have a chance to do something truly historic \u2014 to recognize a tradition that already unites this country and create a national holiday Americans will celebrate for generations to come.\u201d",
      "There are currently no plans to make the Monday after the Super Bowl a national holiday, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told TODAY in September the potential to play the game before Presidents Day does exist, if the league moves from its current 17-game regular season to an 18-game slate.",

Could happen before that just because of the calendar, the way it lays out. But I think 18 weeks would get you to that point, and I think it would be a really great move.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Over a decade after being shot in the head on a bus in Pakistan and becoming a global activist for women\u2019s rights in the Middle East, Malala Yousafzai is reintroducing herself \u2014 in her own words.",
      "\u201cThere is more to my life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com, explaining that her new memoir, \u201cFinding My Way,\u201d explores her \u201cjourney through college years, making friends, finding love and learning more about my activism and talking about mental health.\u201d",
      "She says it was \u201cimportant for people to know the true me\" through her book: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the activist perfect version of me. It\u2019s the more real version of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy story has already been out there in the public eye, and I think it\u2019s a very one-dimensional story that is related to something that happened to me at age 15,\u201d she continues. \u201cI had been defined by the Taliban shooting for such a long time, I wanted to share more about myself.\u201d",
      "In October 2012, Yousafzai was the victim of targeted shooting by members of the Taliban, following years of public activism and national recognition in Pakistan. The shooting drew global attention and further ignited Yousafzai\u2019s activism, leading her to be named among TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d in 2013. The following year, at the age of 17, Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for young people\u2019s education rights.",
      "When asked what she finds is the most misunderstood part of her story, Yousafzai says, \u201cthat I am actually a funnier person than people think.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually like to have moments of laughter and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which I cope with the workload and all that I have experienced. I like spreading joy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting that altered the course of her life, Yousafzai says she was \u201cthis jolly and fun, entertaining\u201d kid growing up in Pakistan \u2014 adding she was even \u201ca bit mischievous\u201d and \u201cliked to get into trouble.\u201d",
      "But once she moved to the United Kingdom to attend Oxford University, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt that I had to live up to the expectation of being an activist. I received so many awards and titles at such a young age that I thought maybe all of this means I cannot be a normal girl anymore,\u201d Yousafzai explains. \u201cI think I was not true to myself as an activist.\u201d",
      "Starting college, Yousafzai says she had the \u201cwrong perception of what the activist life should look like,\u201d which she assumed meant she didn\u2019t have access to \u201cnormal things,\u201d like making friends and falling in love.",
      "\u201cSomehow you have to be stronger and more courageous at everything. You cannot have moments of breakdowns, moments of self doubt,\u201d she says. She would tell herself in difficult times, \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be brave and strong and you\u2019re not going to feel a different way.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over the course of her time at Oxford, however, Yousafzai\u2019s perceptions were shattered and reconstructed.",
      "She tells TODAY.com, \u201cI fell in love, I made friends, I had a mental health breakdown \u2014 all of those things happened all at once. I felt like I was a different person, and I\u2019m grateful for it because it helped me grow.\u201d",
      "How Friendship, a Bong, Therapy and Love Changed Malala Yousafzai\u2019s Life",
      "When she first arrived at Oxford, Yousafzai says she \u201csigned up for every club and society\u201d to meet as many people as possible, despite it feeling \u201cquite awkward and embarrassing\u201d at the time. She adds, \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggled to make friends, I struggled to have these normal moments of joy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a deliberate choice to actually socialize, to actually choose socializing over studying at college, because I wanted to make friends. I wanted to connect with my old self and somehow relive my childhood in my 20s.\u201d",
      "She assumed her fellow classmates would expect her to be \u201ca very serious, boring person, that I only talk about activism,\u201d Yousafzai says, adding, \u201cI just also thought that people may not approach me, thinking that I have nothing fun to say to be part of their friend circle.\u201d",
      "Feeling the pressure to \u201clive up to the expectation\u201d she thought others already set for her, Yousafzai says she realized that people can \u201cinternalize expectation so much that we lose personal identity.\u201d",
      "She explains she had to \u201cdo a lot of unlearning\u201d around who she thought she was.",
      "Once Yousafzai found her people, the \u201cunlearning\u201d began.",
      "\u201cFriendship actually changed me as a person,\u201d she says, noting that the people she surrounded herself with provided the \u201csafest place\u201d to truly express herself without judgement.",
      "One night when her friends were smoking out of a bong, Yousafzai says she opted to try it for the first time, not expecting to be brought back seven years earlier, to October 2012.",
      "\u201cThat brought back flashbacks of the Taliban attack,\u201d she reveals. \u201cThen, after that, I started getting panic attacks and anxiety, and it went on for months.\u201d",
      "When her friend suggested she see a therapist, Yousafzai says she was reluctant, explaining that conversations around mental health are \u201ctaboo\u201d with \u201ca lot of stigma attached to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember my first therapy session. I told the therapist all the problems that I had, and then said, \u2018OK, give me the medication. Let\u2019s just fix it,\u2019\u201d Yousafzai says, laughing. \u201cShe helped me understand that this is not how it works. It\u2019s actually a process.\u201d",
      "Through therapy Yousafzai has been able to redefine \u201cbravery and courage,\u201d saying she now understands that \u201cwhen you decide to still do what you believe in, even in these moments of difficulty, maybe that is true courage and bravery.\u201d",
      "Amid her therapy journey, Yousafzai had another curve ball thrown her way, emotionally speaking: She fell in love.",
      "\u201cI was excited, I was thrilled, but I was also scared and worried,\u201d Yousafzai recalls of falling for her now husband, Asser Malik.",
      "In Pakistani culture, a couple is not supposed to live together until they tie the knot, she explains. Because she wanted to live with Malik, Yousafzai says she suddenly had to consider the \u201cheavy and overwhelming\u201d decision around marriage.",
      "\u201cI had been so scared of marriage growing up because I saw girls married off when they were still in school, and it just meant that their future, their dreams, were taken away. But I also knew that marriage has meant more compromises for women from their career and many other things in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, just the concept of marriage as an institution just scared me.\u201d",
      "Along with her research, which included reading a myriad of books by \u201camazing feminist authors,\u201d Yousafzai says specific conversations with Malik ultimately led to her agreeing to marry him \u2014 \u201cand I do not regret it for a second.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew that he was the right person because he had so much respect for me. He made me feel comfortable with myself. Of course, we were in love with each other, but I started loving myself, and that was a big change,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cSo when you are with the right person, life becomes more beautiful.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on 15-Year-Old Malala Yousafzai",
      "It\u2019s been 13 years since Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban at just 15. Now 28, she has a message for that teenage girl.",
      "\u201cMy younger self was very strong and determined, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m still determined, but I have grown beautifully so much in these years,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cI know that there have been moments of difficulty, but all of that has transformed me into the person I am today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am a young woman and I am really happy with where I am because I am working for the right to education for every girl, because I was also once shot for speaking out for girls, and I was banned from learning,\u201d she continues.",
      "\u201cSo I want to see that change for girls everywhere, that no girl should witness that. And I\u2019m trying to do everything that I can in my capacity to make the world a better place for girls like you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding My Way,\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s newest memoir, was released Oct. 21."

    "story": [
      "In the latest twist in human evolution, scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative.",
      "Dated to around 3.4 million years ago, the species was likely similar to Lucy, an ancient human relative who lived in the area at around the same time, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.",
      "But researchers found that the Burtele foot \u2014 named after the place in northeastern Ethiopia where it was discovered in 2009 \u2014  was unmistakably different.",
      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

      "As his fellow countrymen celebrate Thanksgiving, the first American pontiff\u2019s plate will be full on a six-day tour of Turkey and Lebanon that will be closely scrutinized. He plans to meet with religious and political leaders, lead Mass in both countries and try to provide a boost to long-suffering Christian communities throughout the region.",
      "Ahead of his trip, Leo shared a Thanksgiving message with NBC News in which he encouraged all people \u201cto say \u2018thank you\u2019 to someone\u201d and \u201cto recognize that we have all received so many gifts, first and foremost the gift of life.\u201d",
      "Gifts were shared aboard his flight to the Turkish capital, Ankara, including a pecan pie handed to him by an NBC News correspondent. Leo told journalists that along with other church leaders, he hoped \u201cto announce, transmit, proclaim how important peace is throughout the world and to invite all people to come together to search for greater unity.\u201d",
      "Later, in his first overseas speech since his election in May to lead the 1.4 billion-member church, Leo told Turkish political leaders that the world was experiencing \u201ca heightened level of conflict on the global level, fueled by prevailing strategies of economic and military power.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must in no way give in to this,\u201d he added. The future of humanity is at stake.\u201d",

      "But for Miles Pattenden, a Catholic Church historian at the U.K.\u2019s University of Oxford, the choice of the Middle East was \u201cnot such a surprise,\u201d and it was sending out a message that the region \u201cis the heart of Christianity.\u201d",
      "Turkey, where Leo will stay until Sunday, was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d because it was the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council, Pattenden told NBC News in a telephone interview Wednesday.",
      "Convened by Emperor Constantine, who made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, the meeting of bishops and church leaders \u201cproduced the Nicaean creed, which is the standard statement of what Christians believe,\u201d including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God, Pattenden said.",
      "He added that it was \u201cabsolutely foundational\u201d to what Christians, including Catholics, believe today.",

      "Just as peace talks were gaining traction, Ukraine has lost its lead negotiator.",
      "Andriy Yermak, an ever-present figure at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s side throughout the war with Russia, resigned as chief of staff on Friday after an anti-corruption raid at his home, injecting fresh uncertainty for Ukraine\u2019s leadership.",
      "The exit leaves a vacuum around Zelenskyy as talks accelerate, isolating the Ukrainian president at a critical moment and creating an opening Moscow may try to exploit, analysts say.",
      "The development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that aligned with Moscow\u2019s hard-line demands. An initial deadline of Thursday, imposed by the White House, passed without any announcement as Ukraine and its allies pushed back against calls for the country to cede territory.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Moscow for talks next week with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russia still wants to move toward peace despite its belief that Zelenskyy was not a legitimate leader.",
      "But analysts warn that Yermak\u2019s departure leaves Kyiv navigating unfamiliar waters, as Zelenskyy is forced to steer Ukraine through high-stakes negotiations without his most trusted aide.",
      "Yermak\u2019s resignation comes at a \u201cvery bad time, because we\u2019re really at a possible tipping point where you know what Ukraine is demanding may not be granted or taken into consideration,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News by phone on Saturday.",
      "\u201cNone of us really know what Zelenskyy is like operating solo, because he never has,\u201d he said, adding that Yermak has \u201cbasically stood in\u201d for Zelenskyy at times.",
      "Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, will lead Ukraine\u2019s delegation for a round of talks in the U.S. on Sunday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Umerov has also been mentioned by anti-corruption investigators. Neither he nor Yermak have faced charges.",
      "Bociurkiw added that Yermak\u2019s departure would be unlikely to change Ukraine\u2019s firm stance on territorial concessions, but that Russia \u201cwill try to manipulate and take advantage of this vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner will attend Sunday talks, a U.S. official tells NBC News.",
      "Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant, echoed Bociurkiw\u2019s concerns, saying that Yermak\u2019s resignation, just days before major U.S.-Ukraine-Russia talks and a potential Trump-Putin summit, \u201cdisrupts Kyiv\u2019s preparations and invites counterparts to probe whether Ukraine\u2019s red lines on territory and NATO can be eased during the transition.\u201d",
      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Friday that he was looking for Yermak\u2019s replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "But Bociurkiw said time is \u201cnot on Ukraine\u2019s side right now.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re Ukraine at the moment, he added, \u201cyou need not only a physical army, but an army of diplomats and advocates.\u201d"

      "A top Ukrainian official at the heart of peace talks resigned on Friday after being thrust into the center of a massive corruption scandal, threatening to further weaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a crucial moment in negotiations to end Russia\u2019s war.",
      "Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, quit hours after his home was searched early Friday by investigators with Ukraine\u2019s National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU), which is leading the $100 million kickback probe involving the country\u2019s energy sector.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a later video statement that Yermak had handed in his resignation and he was looking for his replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "The shocking development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that initially offered Moscow its core hard-line demands.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Russia for talks next week."

      "Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S. in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.",
      "Officials have said that Wednesday\u2019s attack on two troops was  carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America\u2019s global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.",
      "\u201cI will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "On Friday, the State Department took the first step: stopping issuance of U.S. visas for all Afghan nationals.",
      "\"The Department of State has IMMEDIATELY paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passports,\" the State Department said in a post on X. \"The Department is taking all necessary steps to protect U.S. national security and public safety.\"",
      "Additionally, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said on X that \"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"",
      "It was not clear exactly which other countries Trump was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.",
      "The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum-seekers.",
      "The president also threatened to \u201cend all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country\u201d and to \u201cdenaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.\u201d",
      "In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was \u201cnon-compatible with Western Civilization.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cOnly REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would re-examine the status of green card holders from 19 countries \u201cof concern,\u201d including Afghanistan.",
      "In a subsequent post, Trump said that \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Somali migrants were \u201ccompletely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protected status \u2014 which prevents deportations to dangerous countries \u2014 for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the East African country.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many people this would affect, but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as \u201cretarded\u201d and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who was born in Somalia, \u201cprobably came into the U.S.A. illegally\u201d and is from a \u201cdecadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged, but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban\u2019s legality.",
      "Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.",
      "\u201cUsing this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.",
      "U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said at a Geneva press briefing: \u201cThey are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.\u201d",
      "U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: \u201cWhen people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,\u201d she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.",
      "The term \u201cthird world\u201d originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn\u2019t aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.",
      "The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.",
      "Economists and health experts have for years said the phrase is inaccurate, derogatory and outdated. The World Bank and other global institutions no longer use the phrase and some have suggested also avoiding its successor, \u201cdeveloping countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."

      "Asked for details on which countries are considered \u201cof concern,\u201d USCIS pointed to a June presidential proclamation listing 19 countries \"considered deficient with regards to screening and vetting.\" Afghanistan is one of the countries on the list, which also includes Haiti, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "The USCIS announcement comes a day after two National Guard members were shot near the White House. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds, Trump said Thursday night, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe remained hospitalized in critical condition. They were in Washington as part of Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops to several U.S. cities.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the suspect, an Afghan national who once assisted American forces, was resettled in the U.S. under a program called Operation Allies Welcome during the Biden administration following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Thursday morning that her office is reviewing the suspect\u2019s immigration history and the vetting process that allowed his entry into the country.",
      "In a long post on X Friday, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Joe Kent claimed that 85,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. under Biden without the \u201crigorous vetting that has protected us in the past.\u201d",
      "He continued, saying that the suspect was \"only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.\"",
      "Those admitted under the Operation Allies Welcome program were required to undergo \"biometric and biographic screenings\" by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Biden administration.",
      "The suspect's immigration process continued into the Trump administration. He was granted asylum in April of this year, which typically occurs two weeks after a final interview with immigration authorities.",
      "In a video released by the White House, Trump called the attack in Washington, D.C., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and said additional National Guard troops would be deployed to the nation's capital.",
      "The administration said shortly after Trump's remarks that all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals will be halted indefinitely.",
      "Authorities have not provided a motive, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \u201cthis is a targeted shooting,\u201d and that the suspect appeared to target the guard members.",
      "Four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said the suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "Speaking with NBC News on Wednesday, a relative of Lakanwal said he arrived in the U.S. in September 2021 after serving in the Afghan Army for 10 years, alongside U.S. Special Forces. Lakanwal was living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.",
      "\u201cWe were the ones that were targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,\u201d said the relative. \u201cI cannot believe it that he might do this.\u201d",

      "Asked Thursday night about Lakanwal's vetting and the fact that he worked with the CIA, Trump responded: \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts. And that happens too, it happens too often with these people,\" an apparent reference to Afghans who came to the U.S. around the time of the 2021 withdrawal."

      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that 89 bodies could not yet be identified. Seventy-nine people were injured, he said. Tang declined to identify the genders and ages of the deceased, saying the investigation was ongoing and the data incomplete.",

      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze to spread rapidly upward and extend to six more buildings, he said, adding that the flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the buildings simultaneously.",
      "The intense heat then ignited the bamboo scaffolding, which also sparked secondary fires when it fell down, he said.",
      "\u201cAlthough the mesh netting met certain flame-retardant requirements, they could still catch fire when exposed to high temperatures,\u201d Tang said. \u201cBamboo scaffolding could also catch fire,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are only flame-retardant. And this is our initial assessment of the situation.\u201d",

      "Additionally, the fire alarms in all eight blocks didn\u2019t sound off when the blaze broke out, Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong\u2019s Fire Services, told reporters.",

    "story": [
      "The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",
      "The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.",
      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",
      "The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.",
      "Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs \"are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States,\" Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.",
      "Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency \"expects those results in the next few weeks.\"",
      "Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.",
      "An outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah continues to grow. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County.",
      "Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. NBC affiliate KSL reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed.",
      "As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025. Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two little girls in Texas, have died."
