      "The papers of composer and songwriter Burt Bacharach are being donated to the Library of Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Burt Bacharach, one of the most celebrated and popular composers and songwriters of the 20th century, will have his papers donated to the Library of Congress.",
      "Bacharach's widow Jane Bacharach, who made the donation, and the Library of Congress, announced the acquisition in a statement Thursday.",
      "The collection includes thousands of music scores and parts, including his arrangement of \u201cThe Look of Love,\u201d and musical sketches for songs including \u201cAlfie\u201d and \u201cRaindrops Keep Falling on My Head.\u201d",
      "Bacharach delighted millions in the 1960s and '70s with those and other quirky and unforgettable melodies including \u201cWalk on By,\u201d \u201cDo You Know the Way to San Jose,\u201d \u201cClose to You\u201d and dozens of other hits.",
      "The Grammy, Oscar and Tony winner died last year at age 94.",
      "Jane Bacharach said in a statement that she chose the institution because Burt Bacharach and songwriting partner Hal David received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2012, and Bacharach valued it above all his other awards. It's the first time the library has acquired a collection from one of its Gershwin recipients.",
      "\u201cBurt poured his heart and soul into his music, and we are so proud that the Library will give others the opportunity to visit and enjoy his legacy,\u201d her statement said.",
      "The collection will become available for researchers in the summer of 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Library is proud to be entrusted with ensuring Bacharach\u2019s music and legacy will remain accessible for future generations, in hopes of inspiring them with his creativity and distinctly American musical genius,\u201d Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in statement.",
      "Bacharach's papers will join the collected manuscripts and papers of Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Billy Strayhorn, Leonard Bernstein and Henry Mancini at the library."

    "story": [
      "It seemed like bad satire, or yet another conspiracy theory",
      "Headlines from the satirical website the Onion on Thursday: \u201cNew Dating Site Suggests People You Already Know But Thought You Were Too Good For.\u201d \u201cTrump Boys Have Slap Fight Over Who Gets to Run Foreign Policy Meetings.\u201d \u201cHere's Why I Decided to Buy Infowars.\u201d",
      "Only one has the ring of truth. Sort of.",
      "The bylined author of the Infowars article, Bryce P. Tetraeder, doesn't actually exist. And the Onion doesn't plan to invest in business school scholarships for promising cult leaders.",
      "But the Onion's purchase of Alex Jones' conspiracy-theory-saturated media empire at a bankruptcy auction tied to lawsuits by the families of Sandy Hook shooting victims is very real \u2014 an effort to fight falsehoods with funny and a who'd-have-thunk-it development in an already somewhat unbelievable year. An element of doubt was added late Thursday when the judge in Jones' bankruptcy case ordered a hearing for next week on how the auction was conducted.",
      "On Thursday, The Onion immediately shut down Infowars and said it plans to relaunch it in January as a parody of conspiracy theorists.",
      "\u201cOur goal in a couple of years is for people to think of Infowars as the funniest and dumbest website that exists,\u201d said Ben Collins, the Onion's CEO. \u201cIt was previously the dumbest website that exists.\u201d",
      "The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, was backed by Sandy Hook families, who were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in lawsuits against Jones for his false claims that the 2012 shootings at a Connecticut elementary school werex a hoax.",
      "The new Infowars will be a satire of theories Jones advanced, which themselves were so absurd that they could have seemed satirical if they hadn't caused real-life harm. The development ends one tentacle of a loose network of podcasters, TikTok influencers and others whose content keeps people perpetually provoked and enraged, Collins said. He called Jones one small character in a universe of fear-based media.",
      "\u201cThey've had a free pass to this point and we don't think that's fair,\u201d he said.",
      "At the very least, he said, the Onion hopes to return some fun to the Internet to offset years of doomscrolling.",
      "In Collins, who once covered misinformation for NBC News, the new venture has a leader uniquely suited to what is being attempted, said Dale Beran, who made this year's Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Anti-Social Network,\u201d about the topic.",
      "The Onion, founded as a newspaper in 1988, has gone through several ownership changes and was purchased earlier this year by a group that includes Jeff Lawson, co-founder of the software company Twilio. Since then, Beran said, it \u201cfeels like there is new life breathed into it.\"",
      "Done well, a satirical site on conspiracy theories and those who traffic in them could meet a historical moment much like comedian Stephen Colbert did when his Comedy Central show, \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d mocked pompous conservative television talk show hosts a decade and more ago.",
      "And what will happen when some of Jones' casual fans who didn't follow the news of the bankruptcy auction log on to Infowars in a few months only to find the Onion's new creation? Probably not much, said Beran, who suggested it's unlikely there's much overlap between people attracted by conspiracy theories and those who want to mock them.",
      "Indeed, conspiracy theories about the Onion's purchase of Infowars began popping up online only hours after it was announced.",
      "\u201cThere's no chance this outlet which hasn't been relevant in years was able to afford this purchase on their own. Who was really behind this?\u201d the website Zeee Media, which bills itself as \u201cone of the most trusted, uncensored sources of information in Australia,\u201d posted on X.",
      "Jones himself hurriedly posted a video aimed at his fans on Thursday. \u201cThis is a total attack on free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deep state is completely out of control.\u201d",
      "There is an impact any time a prominent website that traffics in misinformation is shut down. Still, the business model of reaching people who want to be enraged is still viable, Beran said. Another expert in misinformation suggested Jones will quickly move on, and his fans will move with him.",
      "\u201cAs long as there are people willing to tune in, he will find new outlets,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, head of the Media Effects, Misinformation and Extremism Lab at the University of Buffalo. \u201cIf anything, the Onion trolling and the court cases against him will just make some of his most dedicated fans even more sure of his righteousness, seeing him as a martyr for free speech.\u201d",
      "At the very least, the Onion purchase offered a moment of zen for liberals who have had a pretty rough week or so following Donald Trump's election victory and the GOP sweep in Congress.",
      "\u201cThis is bad karma turned good,\u201d wrote Timothy W. Larson, who describes himself on X as a \u201cunabashed progressive.\" \u201cI love it.\u201d",

      "Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight.",
      "JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion.",
      "The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though.",
      "\u201cWe believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX\u2019s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX\u2019s direction.\u201d",
      "Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \u201cCountdown: Paul vs. Tyson\u201d, a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows.",
      "Last November\u2019s Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d and \u201cFull Swing,\u201d The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \u201cPoint Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year.",
      "The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series \u2014 \u201cQuarterback\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d \u2014 were among Netflix\u2019s top 10 series globally.",
      "Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix on Jan. 5, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events.",
      "Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning in January, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix becomes the carrier of all WWE shows and specials outside the U.S. and the company\u2019s premium live events, including WrestleMania and SummerSlam.",
      "\u201cTechnically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you\u2019ve got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \u201cIt could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve done 20 albums and there\u2019s always a track that's country-ish on each one,\u201d the 84-year-old Starr told The Associated Press recently.",

      "\u201cLiverpool, it\u2019s the capital of country music in England,\u201d Starr said, \u201cbecause a lot of I think it stems from it being a port, and why we got rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music physically, was because the lads on the boats would be going to America, they\u2019d be going to Egypt, would be going all over. But they were bringing music in.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Veteran NBC host and news anchor Craig Melvin has been tapped to replace Hoda Kotb as co-host of the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. hours of \u201cToday.\u201d",
      "Melvin is a familiar face to \u201cToday\u201d show viewers. He currently hosts the show\u2019s third hour and is the news anchor during the first two hours. He will continue hosting the third hour with Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer and Sheinelle Jones.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been an integral and beloved part of our family,\" Libby Leist, senior vice president of \u201cToday,\u201d said in a statement. \"From breaking news coverage in the field, to presidential interviews, to multiple Olympics and Super Bowls, Craig\u2019s shown he has the talent and the range to cover all that we do here at \u2018Today.\u2019 And he does it without ever losing that Southern charm.\u201d",
      "Kotb\u2019s last official day at the show will be Jan. 10. She announced in September that she was leaving \u201cToday,\u201d which generally runs third in the morning ratings to ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d NBC News hasn't revealed the pick for Kotb\u2019s other role, co-anchoring the 10 a.m. hour, which she does with Jenna Bush Hager.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed just a lifetime of blessings and this is the latest,\u201d Melvin said Thursday on air. Of Kotb and Guthrie, he said: \u201cYou guys are the sisters I never thought I needed.\u201d And he said of Kotb \u2014 \u201cyou saved the show,\u201d which, while hyperbolic, was a reference to her taking over hurriedly after the Matt Lauer scandal.",
      "Melvin's wife, sportscaster Lindsay Czarniak, who was host of NBC\u2019s coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games on the USA Network, posted her congratulations on Instagram.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to watch the person you love see their dream come true is such a gift. I will never forget this day and the crowds\u2019 excitement to share your good news,\u201d she wrote."

      "NEW YORK -- The lawyer for a former cast member of the \u201cReal Housewives of New York\u201d told a federal judge Thursday that the First Amendment cannot shield the show\u2019s creators from a lawsuit alleging that the show\u2019s participants were subjected to a \u201crotted workplace culture.\u201d",
      "Attorney Sarah Matz said the lawsuit brought by Leah McSweeney earlier this year should advance to the stage where evidence can be gathered for trial.",
      "Adam Levin, a lawyer for defendants including entertainer Andy Cohen, one of the show\u2019s producers, and the Bravo channel, told the judge that the lawsuit\u2019s allegations were protected by the First Amendment and that it should be dismissed at a stage in which the judge is required to assume the allegations are true.",
      "The judge did not immediately rule on the future of the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages for mental, emotional, physical pain along with impairment of life's joys and lost future earnings.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court alleges that McSweeney, who suffers from alcoholism, was pressured to drink booze on the show and was retaliated against when she wanted to stay sober or was denied reasonable accommodations to aid her efforts at sobriety.",
      "It also alleges that the defendants \u201cemployed psychological warfare intentionally weaponized to break Ms. McSweeney's psyche,\u201d particularly when she was intimidated and prevented from visiting her dying grandmother through threats to cut her pay or fire her if she left the filming location.",
      "\u201cThey knew she was trying to be sober,\u201d Matz told the judge. \u201cThe show is not called the \u2018Drunk Housewives of New York City.\u2019\u201d",
      "The judge, who said he had never seen the show, asked each side numerous questions and seemed inclined to, at a minimum, strike some allegations from the lawsuit that pertained to events on camera.",
      "Levin told him the lawsuit should be tossed in its entirety. He said ruling in favor of the claims made in McSweeney's lawsuit \u201cwould kill\u201d some television and Broadway stage shows if the First Amendment did not protect the producers of shows.",
      "Particularly when it comes to a reality television show, the cast member becomes the message of the show and \u201cyou can't separate the person from the speech,\u201d Levin said.",
      "\u201cWhat are the limits a director can do to induce the behavior the director wants?\u201d the judge asked as he questioned whether a director could demand that show participants not sleep for two days before filming or subject themselves to a physical assault just before they go on camera.",
      "Levin said there were limits to First Amendment protection for the creators of a communicative show, but he said they were narrow in scope. McSweeney's lawsuit, he said, did not fall within the narrow exceptions, such as when a producer might commit a criminal felony offense during the production of a show."

      "In her over 40 years as top casting director behind so many classics, \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cHeartburn\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d to name just a few, she did, technically give Streep her first film role. She gave many stars their big breaks. But Streep, she said, was always going to happen \u2014 the young stage actor was the talk of the town in New York as soon as she came on the scene. Taylor was simply the lucky one who happened to be casting for \u201cJulia,\u201d which didn\u2019t conflict with a play.",
      "Modesty is not antithetical to being a great casting director, though, a profession of observation, negotiation and nuance that operates mostly out of the public eye. It\u2019s why Taylor's a little nervous about Sunday, when she\u2019ll be presented with an honorary Oscar at the film academy\u2019s annual Governors Awards in a room full of Hollywood greats.",
      "Recognition is long overdue for Taylor and her peers. Earlier this year, the film academy announced that it would add a new competitive Oscar for casting directors starting with films released in 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much people don\u2019t know about casting actors,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOne thing is we negotiate all the contracts and we cast a movie within a budget.\u201d",
      "Casting wasn\u2019t always the art that it is today. In the studio system, it was more of cattle call, an organizational rather than creative job. But Taylor began her career in 1968 at time of change, mentored by one of the pioneers behind the movement: Marion Dougherty, who scouted talent in off-Broadway plays and turned casting into a more selective, humane process. It was also a profession led by a lot of women. Dougherty used to joke that it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t get paid much.",
      "The first movie Taylor led casting on was \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a baptism by fire in many ways. Director William Friedkin had not gotten along with Dougherty on \u201cThe Night They Raided Minsky\u2019s\" and called the office with a strange request.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I hear you have a really good assistant. Would you let her cast my movie?\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did that as something that was not nice to do. That was terrifying for me. I was scared to death the entire time.\u201d",
      "But she also found her voice on the film, discovering Linda Blair and taking a shot on Jason Miller, a playwright who she had a good feeling about.",
      "\u201cHe had such a great face and he was such an interesting kind of brooding man,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll come in and cry.\u2019 He did and he got the part. That was exciting. That\u2019s a casting director\u2019s dream.\u201d",
      "As a New Yorker, Taylor quickly established herself as a go-to casting director for the likes of Woody Allen, for whom she cast over 40 films, Mike Nichols, Nora Ephron and Alan Parker. Among her over 100 credits, she did both \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d and \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d for Steven Spielberg, \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for Martin Scorsese, \u201cBig\u201d for Penny Marshall and \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d for James L Brooks.",
      "\u201cSo many of them turned out so well because I worked for such wonderful directors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m being falsely modest, but I do feel like so many of these people were just so talented you couldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d",
      "Some of her proudest moments were finding real people to fill out movies, like the lounge singer in \u201cBroadway Danny Rose.\u201d There are also the actors who she didn\u2019t give up on.",
      "\u201cI used to drag poor Jeff Daniels in for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then also there were two different communities of actors and there was very little intermingling. New York actors came to New York to be in the theater. If they got a movie, that was thrilling, but they didn\u2019t come thinking they were going to be a star.\u201d",
      "For the most part, she and her longest running filmmaker partners, Allen and Nichols, were able to operate independently.",
      "\u201cWoody made his movies on a very tight budget with the agreement that he wouldn\u2019t be interfered with,\u201d she said. \u201cMike Nichols was so admired that people didn\u2019t bother with him too much at first. But as his movies got more expensive, then you started to see a little bit more interference.\u201d",
      "When \u201cWorking Girl\u201d came along, for instance, the studio had ideas about needing bigger stars. She and Nichols wanted Alec Baldwin as the male lead, but he was too unknown for the studio and Harrison Ford was called in.",
      "Taylor retired a few years ago and doesn't regret it. She\u2019ll still talk to some of her old director friends about projects here and there. But she\u2019s mostly just enjoying going to the theater. And she\u2019s excited that her profession is being celebrated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ve been so many people who went before us who really deserved it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very moving for me and the whole community. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d"

      "Pascrell said that the recent tournament success of New Jersey colleges Seton Hall and St. Peter's were bet on, either with illegal offshore internet sites, or legally by gamblers traveling to other states where it is permitted.",
      "The bill was approved and released from an Assembly committee Thursday. It still must be approved by both full chambers of the Legislature and signed by Gov. Phil Murphy to become law.",
      "New Jersey's lawsuit challenging a ban on legal sports betting in all but four U.S. states led to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling allowing any state in the nation to offer it; 38 currently do, and Missouri will soon become the 39th.",

      "\u201cThis case was no layup, not for anyone. A lot of hard work went into this,\" Lopez said during the hearing.",

      "\u201cToday is a landmark day for Diamond, as we embark on a new path for our business. Diamond is now unencumbered by legacy debt, financially stable and enthusiastically supported by new ownership,\" Diamond CEO David Preschlack said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead, Diamond is well-positioned to further enhance its product offering and remains committed to delivering the highest quality live sports content in-market to fans through both linear and direct-to-consumer frameworks.\"",
      "Last month as part of the reorganization plan, Diamond voided the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays while attempting to rework the deals of the five franchises that had partial ownership of their regional sports networks.",
      "Diamond has revised deals with the Tigers and Rays, as well as reaching agreements with the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels and Miami Marlins, which include streaming rights. Talks are continuing with the Kansas City Royals.",
      "The Cincinnati Reds and Diamond have ended their joint venture, but a lawyer for Diamond said during Thursday's hearing that they would be open to resuming discussions. Shortly after the hearing, Major League Baseball announced it will produce and distribute Reds games next season.",

      "Atlanta was the only franchise whose contract would have been unchanged, but the Braves have agreed to an amended deal, which include streaming rights.",
      "Steaming is an important avenue for Diamond as it seeks to find new audiences. The company announced on Wednesday it reached a multiyear agreement with Prime Video to make its channels available as an add-on subscription.",

      "Words and phrases like \u201cnostalgia\u201d or \u201cback to her roots\u201d come to mind when listening to Gwen Stefani\u2019s fifth studio album, \u201cBouquet\u201d \u2014 and it is in no way negative, writes The Associated Press' Cristina Jaleru in her review",
      "Words and phrases like \u201cnostalgia\u201d or \u201cback to her roots\u201d come to mind when listening to Gwen Stefani\u2019s fifth studio album, \u201cBouquet\u201d \u2014 and it is in no way negative.",
      "Across 10-tracks, the powerhouse singer leans into the mellow rock of her youth \u2014 think Hall & Oates, Chicago, Fleetwood Mac \u2014 with dashes of country vibes here and there. Her voice is ageless, unaltered and distinctive, immediately recalling the early aughts when No Doubt still existed, and Stefani was still a bit of a ska girl.",
      "Thematically, however, the songs are about a woman who\u2019s been through the ringer \u2014 but life gave her a reprieve in her second act, and she found stability, lots of flowers and no mo\u2019 drama. In that way, \u201cBouquet\u201d is a not so furtive ode to husband Blake Shelton \u2014 who she met and fell in love with while they were both coaches on the singing reality competition show, \u201cThe Voice.\" At the time, they were both going through divorces to Gavin Rossdale and Miranda Lambert, respectively.",
      "On \u201cBouquet,\u201d the Stefani-Shelton romance arrives through yacht rock sounds and flowery language in songs with titles like \u201cMarigolds,\u201d \u201cLate to Bloom\u201d and \u201cEmpty Vase.\u201d When the album reaches its end, it is with a duet with Shelton on \u201cPurple Irises.\"",
      "If the album tells a story of her relationship, it starts with the opener \u201cSomebody Else's.\u201d Stefani starts off the proceedings by listing her previous romantic entanglement and bad choices. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a heart like mine/Was doin\u2019 in a love like that, ah,\" she sings. \"I don\u2019t\u205fknow\u205fwhat\u205fa woman like\u205fme/Was doin\u2019 with\u205fa man like you, ooh.\u201d",
      "It's a direct counter to the title track, where the focus appears to be back on Shelton: \u201cWe met when my heart was broken/Thank God that yours was, too,\u201d she shares. \u201cSo lucky that you were goin'/ Through what I was goin' through.\u201d",
      "In \"Late to Bloom,\u201d she decries the fact that they met so late in life.",
      "A nice bass progression, a clever turn of the phrase and a great voice are what it takes to get this album going. Add a cohesive theme, a pleasant vibe and a charismatic star \u2014- and that's coming up roses.",

      "When composer Mason Bates approached Michael Chabon about turning his novel \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d into an opera, he said the writer told him frankly that \u201copera was not his thing.\u201d",
      "BLOOMINGTON, Indiana -- When composer Mason Bates approached Michael Chabon about turning his novel \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d into an opera, he said the writer told him frankly that \u201copera was not his thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very supportive of the endeavor and he gave it his blessing, but he said he couldn\u2019t be involved,\u201d Bates recalled. \u201cHe was really more giving it a thumbs-up on a rights level.\u201d",
      "So Bates and librettist Gene Scheer proceeded on their own to wrangle into operatic form Chabon\u2019s sprawling, Pulitzer Prize-winning tale about two young Jewish cousins set over more than a decade before and after World War II.",
      "Now, six years after Bates first read the novel and became inspired by it, the opera is bound for the Metropolitan Opera, due to open the company\u2019s next season in September 2025.",
      "But first it\u2019s having its world premiere on Friday in what might seem an unlikely spot, at the Jacobs School of Music on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. The premiere was originally planned for the Los Angeles Opera, but the company begged off, citing the costs involved.",
      "Bloomington turns out to be not such a surprising choice given that the school has nearly 300 voice students and the Musical Arts Center, built in 1972, was modeled after the Met stage.",
      "\u201cThe space and technology and those kinds of production elements were very attractive to the Met in terms of how the opera would play here,\u201d said Catherine Compton, managing director of the school\u2019s opera and ballet theater program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been heartening to see how our students have reacted and been elevated by the Met\u2019s creative team that\u2019s been in residence here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also how the creative team has been able to adapt their process to our students.\u201d",
      "In fact, Met staff will be back in Bloomington in January to workshop another forthcoming commission, an opera by Carlos Simon called \u201cIn the Rush\u201d with a libretto by playwright Lynn Nottage and her daughter, Ruby Aiyo Gerber.",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d was commissioned by the Met after Peter Gelb, the company\u2019s general manager, attended a performance of Bates\u2019 first opera, \u201cThe (R)evolution of Steve Jobs,\u201d in 2017 in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Paul Cremo, the Met\u2019s dramaturg, connected Bates with Scheer, a veteran librettist widely praised for his work in turning Herman Melville\u2019s unwieldy masterpiece \u201cMoby Dick\u201d into the text for an opera composed by Jake Heggie. The Met will perform that opera next March.",
      "\u201cI give \u2018Moby Dick\u2019 to new librettists for a model of how to get to the essence,\u201d Cremo said. \u201c\u2018Kavalier & Clay\u2019 goes down a lot of side roads into history and nooks and crannies. I figured we needed somebody who gets how to adapt and condense a book into an opera.\u201d",
      "With many of the \u201cnooks and crannies\u201d \u2014 like a 40-page detour to Antarctica \u2014 stripped away, Scheer was able to focus on the two main characters.",
      "There\u2019s Joe Kavalier, who escapes to America from Czechoslovakia on the eve of the Holocaust, dreams of bringing his younger brother to safety in America, and falls in love with Rosa, a Bohemian artist. His cousin is the Brooklyn-born Sammy Clay, who dreams of striking it rich and, ambivalent about his sexuality, has a thwarted love affair with a handsome actor.",
      "Together, using Sammy\u2019s talent for story-telling and Joe\u2019s artistic genius, the cousins invent a wildly popular comic strip character called The Escapist.",
      "Scheer and Bates identified three distinct worlds depicted in the novel, each of which lent itself to a different compositional style.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the world of World War II, where we see the Kavalier family picked off one by one,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dark musical space with a lot of drums and mandolins. Then the big band music of 1940s New York, a lot of swing, a lot of jazz. Then when they start to draw and they create art, we go into this electro-acoustic, techno-symphonic space.\u201d",
      "Bates said he deliberately keeps these sound worlds separate at first, but \u201cwhat becomes really exciting in the opera is that as Joe goes through kinds of a psychedelic spiral, these worlds start to collide and smash together.\u201d",
      "Keeping these worlds visually separate and then merging them posed both a challenge and an opportunity for director Bart Sher, who worked on the set design with 59 Productions, a company known for its innovative use of projections and animation.",
      "\u201cThe unique challenge to \u2018Kavalier & Clay\u2019 is the simultaneity of space and time,\u201d Sher said. \u201cYou might see them working in the office of Empire Toys and at the same time see their family struggling in Prague, and at the same time see them try to capture what the experience is like through The Escapist.",
      "\u201cAnd if you can get all three of those elements to work at the same time and have music and song \u2014 then you really have something in this piece that I think is very special.\u201d",

      "Since a trip to Ethiopia in 1985 during the famine, Curtis has also devoted much of his time and energy to charitable causes: Co-founding Comic Relief, producing Red Nose Day for years and helping create organizations like Make Poverty History and more. Decades of work has helped raise more than $2 billion and supported over 170 million people.",
      "On Sunday he\u2019s being celebrated for those efforts by the film academy with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Getting an Oscar is especially exciting for Curtis who remembers as a teen having to wait until the night after to watch the broadcast in the U.K.",
      "\u201cI've been excited by their existence for 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is particularly a special award, but it\u2019s not work for which one expects praise or needs praise. So it\u2019s very lovely.\u201d",
      "Curtis spoke to The Associated Press about his second career, the state of romantic comedies and Hugh Grant\u2019s second act. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CURTIS: No, it\u2019s been one of those cascading things. I have always found that if you create a sort of venue for generosity, the public reaction is so often astonishing. When did this first TV show, we thought we\u2019d make \u00a35 million, but we made \u00a315 million. The next year we made \u00a327 million. I would have had to be a monster not to continue with it. I thought it was going to last a year. Instead, it\u2019s lasted a lifetime.",
      "CURTIS: We have a younger generation that is very passionate about issues of gender and diversity and climate. There\u2019s a more sophisticated understanding of how you solve problems and change things. A lot of it is about giving power to people on the ground. And particularly since the pandemic, it\u2019s important to go on pointing out how much difference a small amount of money can make abroad and at home.",
      "CURTIS: I don\u2019t see the things as different. What is slightly peculiar is that I have written two very serious movies, one about malaria and the other about the negotiation of a G8 (summit). But when doing my own films, I\u2019ve focused more on private romantic things and not gone all out on the stuff that I do the charity work for.",
      "CURTIS: I\u2019m a bit puzzled by it. I can\u2019t but sort of think it\u2019s almost a lucky break. I remember once bumping into Chris Rock, who I had never met, and he said to me, \u201cI like your films because they\u2019ve got man jokes in them.\u201d I think he was saying that the sentiment is repeatedly either undercut or reinforced by jokes that you don\u2019t quite expect. There must be something in that combination that makes feel people feel comfortable with the heart of it.",
      "CURTIS: I think all of these things go in waves. There are two shows on telly at the moment, \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d and \u201cColin from Accounts\u201d that I really love. \u201c(500) Days of Summer\u201d was a long time ago but I adored that. And it wasn\u2019t a comedy but \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d I think when you look back, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a consistent stream of movies that deal with those issues, just not in quite the same format.",
      "CURTIS: Very much. With regard to Hugh now, no acting required. He was always a scoundrel. I think it\u2019s easier for him. He had to work harder in my movies when he was pretending to be nice. Now he\u2019s a self-evident psychopath. I\u2019m obviously joking but I love them. There were 10 years there where no one took any risks with Hugh. And it\u2019s lovely now that people are casting him in very different roles. I hope he does one or two movies more in line with what we used to do. He\u2019s a very interesting older man. But I\u2019m loving his current tendency to kill people.",
      "CURTIS: It has been a very schizophrenic life, in the end. It has been 50/50 for about the last 15 years. It\u2019s interesting thinking about how movies can affect change \u2014 the work of Participant and the idea that you could turn films into something with a real-world impact. I believe hugely in the ability of movies to change people\u2019s hearts and minds and attitudes. I do think that that might be worth us all thinking about is whether movies should have impact producers \u2014 a mechanism that actually tries to make the film as effective as possible in the real world. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve started to think about in joining the two halves of my life together."

      "On her debut solo record \u201cWhat a Relief,\u201d released last month on Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 Saddest Factory Records, Gavin channels a bluesy, nostalgic tone to explore intimacy, grief and intergenerational trauma. The lyrics are spare and reflect heartfelt \u2014 and at times earnest \u2014 realizations about pain and self-discovery. Created over seven years, the album is, as Gavin said, a testament to \u201chow much we change and stay the same\u201d over time.",

      "The process of opening myself up to new people \u2014 to work creatively \u2014 is very vulnerable.",
      "Gavin: It\u2019s a fun song. It feels young. It feels very much in the world of crush and fantasy. Which is one of my favorite kinds of pop songs to write.",
      "The solo project is, by nature, a very measured project. I\u2019m not really making these big, bold, sweeping pop statements. It\u2019s quite small and nuanced. My solo project is very \u201cif you know, you know.\u201d",

      "There was a photo that she had taken \u2014 on view at Regen Projects \u2014 of a recent girlfriend in a bedroom with a bunch of stuff strewn everywhere. That photo was on every mood board and every treatment that I made for this album. It was the wallpaper on my computer. I was just like, \u201cThis is the vibe.\u201d",
      "Gavin: There are certain artists that I avoid listening to, if I notice that they really stick to me. I couldn\u2019t really write like Tori (Amos) or Fiona (Apple), even if I really tried super hard to emulate them, so I\u2019m not that worried about it. I\u2019m not a prodigious piano player, so it\u2019s going to be fine, you know what I mean?",

There\u2019s something very poetic about the solo tour for this record putting me back in Chicago in the winter. Really brutal. We\u2019re doing it in a van, and I haven\u2019t been back in a van, you know, in a minute.",

      "Christie\u2019s announced Friday it will sell more than 130 items, including 90 guitars, from the collection of the Yardbirds and Jeff Beck Group guitarist, who died in January 2023 at age 78.",
      "Valued at more than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million), the collection includes an oxblood 1954 Gibson Les Paul that Beck bought in Memphis in 1972 and played for the rest of the decade. The guitar, which is featured on the cover of Beck\u2019s Grammy-winning 1975 jazz-fusion album \u201cBlow by Blow,\u201d is expected to sell for between 350,000 pounds and 500,000 pounds ($450,000 and $640,000).",
      "Amelia Walker, head of Private and Iconic Collections at Christie's, called it \u201ca really beautiful instrument, covered in grime and dust and signs of use.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s part of the appeal,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are things that he used. They\u2019ve got the indents of his fingernails on the fret boards. Some of them, the strings haven\u2019t been changed for years. He played them hard. He didn\u2019t see them as precious works of art \u2014 they were his tools to ply his trade with.\u201d",
      "Beck came to prominence in the 1960s with hard-rock progenitors the Yardbirds and went on to a solo career that incorporated rock, jazz, blues and even opera. Twice inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with the Yardbirds and as a solo artist \u2014 he played with everyone from Rod Stewart to Davie Bowie, Stevie Wonder and Tina Turner, and was known for his improvisational skill and the unique sound he got from the whammy bar on his preferred guitar, the Fender Stratocaster.",
      "\u201cHe had an unparalleled ability to bend entire tones\u201d on the Strat, Walker said. The sale includes Beck\u2019s 1954 Sunburst Fender Stratocaster, valued at between 50,000 pounds and 80,000 pounds ($65,000 and $100,000), and a white Strat that was his staple instrument for 16 years, played everywhere from Ronnie Scott\u2019s jazz club to the Obama White House. It has an estimated value between 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds ($26,000 and $39,000).",
      "One of a group of 1960s guitar heroes that included Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix, Beck was revered by many peers as \u201cthe ultimate maestro,\u201d Walker said.",
      "As well as Beck\u2019s beloved Strats, the sale features other models including a Telecaster-Gibson hybrid \u201cTele-Gib\u201d valued at between 100,000 pounds and 150,000 pounds ($130,000 and $190,000).",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter what he was playing, he\u2019d always sound like Jeff Beck,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what the amp was turned to or which guitar, he could still pick it up and make it sound incredible. It\u2019s all in the fingers, and in his brain.\u201d",
      "The sale follows Christie's auction of some of Dire Straits\u2019 guitarist Mark Knopfler\u2019s collection, which raised more than 8.8 million pounds ($11.2 million) earlier this year, and memorabilia from model, artist and 1960s musicians\u2019 muse Pattie Boyd, which sold for 2.8 million pounds ($3.6 million) in March.",
      "Beck\u2019s widow, Sandra Beck, said it was a \u201cmassive wrench\u201d to part with the collection, but that \u201cI know Jeff wanted for me to share this love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter some hard thinking I decided they need to be shared, played and loved again,\u201d she said.",
      "A selection of the guitars will go on display at Christie's Los Angeles showroom Dec. 4-6, and the whole collection will be at Christie\u2019s in London from Jan. 15 until the sale on Jan. 22."

      "Former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse is scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 13 in Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse is set to stand trial early next year in Las Vegas on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls, a significant development in the sweeping criminal case after more than a year of stalled court proceedings while he challenged it.",
      "His trial in Clark County District Court is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 13, court records show. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to 21 felonies, including sexual assault, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reported.",
      "Prosecutors are now able to move forward with their case because Chasing Horse was again indicted last month following a Nevada Supreme Court decision that his original indictment be dismissed. The high court's order left open the possibility for the charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "The high court said in its September order that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence of Chasing Horse's alleged crimes without any expert testimony. But the justices also made clear in their ruling that their decision was not weighing in on Chasing Horse's guilt or innocence, saying the allegations against him are serious.",
      "Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "After starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies.",
      "Prosecutors said he used his authority to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest in January near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since.",
      "Chasing Horse's arrest reverberated around Indian Country as law enforcement in the U.S. and Canada quickly followed up with more criminal charges. In Montana, authorities there said his arrest helped corroborate long-standing allegations against him on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Tribal leaders banished Chasing Horse from the reservation in 2015 amid allegations of human trafficking.",
      "His latest indictment in Las Vegas includes new allegations that Chasing Horse filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos."

      "The purchase of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga",
      "The purchase of Alex Jones ' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga between the far-right conspiracy theorist and families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.",
      "The sale was ordered after relatives of many of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 shooting successfully sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress. Jones repeatedly made false claims on his show that the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Here are some things to know about how Jones' misinformation empire ended up on the auction block.",
      "Fresh out of high school in the early 1990s, Jones, a barrel-chested, gravelly voiced Texas native, started broadcasting on a public-access television channel in the state capital. From the start, Jones promoted conspiracies about the U.S. government and false claims about a secret New World Order.",
      "In 2004, Jones had two employees and a tiny office in south Austin. In 2007, he formed Free Speech Systems, to run his growing media business, according to court records in his bankruptcy cases. By 2010, Jones had over 60 employees.",
      "As the outlandish nature of his false claims grew, so did his media empire, with annual revenues of up to $80 million, and a fanbase that at his height listened to him on more than 100 radio stations across the United States as well as through his Infowars website and social media.",
      "Jones has acknowledged in court that he promoted the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated in part by the U.S. government as part of an effort to expand gun control. He called the parents of slain children \u201ccrisis actors\u201d on his show and said the shooting was \u201cphony as a three-dollar bill.\u201d",
      "After separate defamation lawsuits were filed in Connecticut and Texas by family members of victims, Jones acknowledged in 2022 that the shooting was \u201c100% real\u201d and said it was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d to call it a hoax.",
      "Victims\u2019 families who sued Jones said they were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on his show.",
      "Courts in Texas and Connecticut found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax and awarded the families nearly $1.5 billion in damages. In both states, the judges issued default judgments finding Jones liable without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over many documents. Juries then heard evidence and decided on the amount of damages, with judges tacking on additional penalties.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment. Up for sale was everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras.",
      "The Onion acquired Infowars' website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; and video archive. The sale price was not disclosed.",
      "After the sale was announced, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location.",
      "Jones vowed to challenge the sale and auction process in court, and late Thursday a federal judge ordered a hearing into exactly how The Onion won the bidding. Lawyers for Jones and a company affiliated with Infowars alleged the trustee overseeing the auction changed the bidding process just days before it was held."

      "The satirical news publication The Onion was named the winning bidder for Alex Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction Thursday, backed by families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims whom Jones owes more than $1 billion in defamation judgments for calling the massacre a hoax.",
      "The purchase would turn over Jones\u2019 company, which for decades has peddled in conspiracy and misinformation, to a humor website that plans to relaunch the Infowars platform in January as a parody. But the judge in Jones\u2019 bankruptcy case said Thursday that he had concerns about how the auction was conducted and ordered a hearing for next week after complaints by lawyers for Jones and a company affiliated with Jones that put in a $3.5 million bid.",
      "Within hours of the announcement about The Onion's winning bid, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location. Up for sale were Infowars\u2019 website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; video archive; and other assets.",
      "\u201cThe dissolution of Alex Jones\u2019 assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for,\u201d Robbie Parker, whose daughter Emilie was killed in the 2012 shooting in Connecticut, said in a statement provided by his lawyers.",
      "The satirical outlet \u2014 which carries the banner of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Finest News Source\u201d on its masthead \u2014 was founded in the 1980s and for decades has skewered politics and pop culture, including making Jones a frequent target of mocking articles. Mass shootings in the U.S., such as the Sandy Hook attack, are often followed by The Onion publishing slightly updated versions of one of its most well-known recurring pieces: \"'No Way to Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\u201d",
      "On his live broadcast, Jones was angry and defiant, calling the sale \u201ca total attack on free speech.\u201d He later announced his show was being shut down. Jones then resumed his broadcast from a new studio nearby and carried it live on his accounts on X.",
      "At a court hearing Thursday afternoon in Houston, the trustee who oversaw the auction, Christopher Murray, acknowledged that The Onion did not have the highest bid but said it was a better deal overall because some of the Sandy Hook families agreed to forgo a portion of the sale proceeds to pay Jones' other creditors. First United American Companies, a business affiliated with one of Jones\u2019 product-selling websites, submitted the only other bid. The trustee said he could not put a dollar amount on The Onion\u2019s bid.",
      "Walter Cicack, an attorney for First United American Companies, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez that Murray changed the auction process only days before, deciding not to hold a round Wednesday where parties could outbid each other. Sealed bids were submitted last week, and the trustee chose only from those, Cicack said.",
      "Murray said he followed the judge's auction rules laid out in a September order that made the overbidding round optional. But Lopez said he was surprised such a round of bidding was not held and that he had concerns about transparency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to an evidentiary hearing and I\u2019m going to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.\u201d",
      "An exact date of next week\u2019s hearing was not immediately set.",
      "After the hearing, Jones said on his show that he thought the auction was unfairly rigged and expressed optimism that the judge would nullify the sale. He has repeatedly told his listeners that if his supporters won the bidding, he could stay on the Infowars platforms but that he had set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts in case they were needed.",
      "\u201cThis was a auction that didn\u2019t happen, with a bid that was lower, with money that wasn\u2019t real,\" he said.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, told The Associated Press in a video interview earlier Thursday that it planned to relaunch the Infowars website in January with satire aimed at conspiracy theorists and right-wing personalities, as well as educational information about gun violence prevention from the group Everytown for Gun Safety. Collins would not disclose the bid amount.",
      "\u201cWe thought it would be a very funny joke if we bought this thing, probably one of the better jokes we\u2019ve ever told,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe (Sandy Hook) families decided they would effectively join our bid, back our bid, to try to get us over the finish line. Because by the end of the day, it was us or Alex Jones, who could either continue this website unabated, basically unpunished, for what he\u2019s done to these families over the years, or we could make a dumb, stupid website, and we decided to do the second thing.\u201d",
      "Jones did not lose his personal X account, which has more than 3 million followers, in the auction. But the bankruptcy judge is deciding whether his personal accounts can be sold off at the trustee\u2019s request.",
      "Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his company for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers. Jones has since acknowledged the shooting was \u201c100% real.\u201d",
      "The Onion, based in Chicago, bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading news publication, offering highly acclaimed, universally revered coverage of breaking national, international, and local news events.\u201d Recent headlines have included, \u201cTrump Boys Have Slap Fight Over Who Gets To Run Foreign Policy Meetings,\u201d \u201cOklahoma Law Requires Ten Commandments To Be Displayed In Every Womb\u201d and \u201cMan Forgetting Difference Between Meteoroid, Meteorite Struggles To Describe What Just Killed His Dog.\u201d",

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",

      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%.

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",

      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",

      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life.

      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked a prominent vaccine skeptic to lead the nation\u2019s sprawling public health apparatus",
      "President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus.",
      "A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto.",
      "But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists.",
      "Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy.",
      "Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading:",
      "He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits.",
      "Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated.",
      "While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.",
      "He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies.",
      "Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century.",
      "He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "He is especially focused on putting an end to the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.",
      "He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees.",
      "Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News.",
      "\u201cWe need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,\u201d Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube.",
      "He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives.",
      "Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated.",
      "Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid. He then suspended that campaign earlier this year and endorsed Trump, who has repeatedly praised Kennedy, promised him influence in a future administration, and vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "The GOP base has eagerly welcomed Kennedy since he joined forces with Trump, an embrace Kennedy never received from the Democratic Party. His anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his famous family.",
      "Doctors found a dead parasitic worm in Kennedy's brain and high levels of mercury that he said caused brain fog and memory problems.",
      "He once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York\u2019s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city in 2014. A photo showed Kennedy with his fingers in the bear\u2019s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face and an apparent bloodstain on his pantleg.",
      "He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.",
      "And a federal law enforcement agency opened an investigation after Kennedy allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The National Marine Fisheries Service ended the probe a short time later.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination is certain to be opposed by the pharmaceutical lobby in Washington, which relies on the predictability of FDA\u2019s science-based rules to bring new medicines to market.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposals for the agency bear little resemblance to those of prior Republican administrations, which have typically favored cutting regulations to speed up product approvals.",
      "Instead, Kennedy has suggested barring drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He\u2019s also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products, allowing the agency to hire extra scientists to speed up their work. Replacing those funds would require billions in new appropriations from the federal budget.",
      "In a post last month to the social media platform X, Kennedy vowed to end FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "In recent interviews, Kennedy has also suggested clearing out \u201centire departments\u201d at FDA, including the one responsible for nutrition standards.",
      "The Kennedy pick was condemned by public health officials and some congressional Democrats.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., is not remotely qualified for the role and should be nowhere near the science-based agencies that safeguard our nutrition, food safety, and health,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the public health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "But it also won some bipartisan support.",
      "\u201cFinally, someone to detox the place after the Fauci era,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, wrote on the social media platform X, referring to Anthony Fauci, the former leading public health official who has been demonized by people opposed to vaccines and the government's response to COVID-19.",
      "Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about Kennedy's appointment and said he would shake up HHS and the FDA.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m most optimistic about is taking on big pharma and the corporate ag oligopoly to improve our health,\u201d Polis wrote on X. Facing backlash, he later added, \u201cScience must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:34:20 -0500",
    "summary": "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",
    "story": [
      "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Those ever-present TV drug ads showing patients hiking, biking or enjoying a day at the beach could soon have a different look: New rules require drugmakers to be clearer and more direct when explaining their medications' risks and side effects.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration spent more than 15 years crafting the guidelines, which are designed to do away with industry practices that downplay or distract viewers from risk information.",
      "Many companies have already adopted the rules, which become binding Nov. 20. But while regulators were drafting them, a new trend emerged: thousands of pharma influencers pushing drugs online with little oversight. A new bill in Congress would compel the FDA to more aggressively police such promotions on social media platforms.",
      "\u201cSome people become very attached to social media influencers and ascribe to them credibility that, in some cases, they don\u2019t deserve,\u201d said Tony Cox, professor emeritus of marketing at Indiana University.",
      "Still, TV remains the industry's primary advertising format, with over $4 billion spent in the past year, led by blockbuster drugs like weight-loss treatment Wegovy, according to ispot.tv, which tracks ads.",
      "The new rules, which cover both TV and radio, instruct drugmakers to use simple, consumer-friendly language when describing their drugs, without medical jargon, distracting visuals or audio effects. A 2007 law directed the FDA to ensure that drug risk information appears \u201cin a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner.\u201d",
      "FDA has always required that ads give a balanced picture of both benefits and risks, a requirement that gave rise to those long, rapid-fire lists of side effects parodied on shows like \u201c Saturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "But in the early 2000s, researchers began showing how companies could manipulate images and audio to de-emphasize safety information. In one example, a Duke University professor found that ads for the allergy drug Nasonex, which featured a buzzing bee voiced by Antonio Banderas, distracted viewers from listening to side effect information, making it harder to remember.",
      "Such overt tactics have largely disappeared from drug ads.",
      "\u201cIn general, I would say the ads have gotten more complete and transparent,\u201d says Ruth Day, director of the medical cognition lab at Duke University and author of the Nasonex study.",
      "The new rules are \u201csignificant steps forward,\u201d Day said, but certain requirements could also open the door to new ways of downplaying risks.",
      "One requirement instructs companies to show on-screen text about side effects while the audio information plays. A 2011 FDA study found that combining text with audio increased recall and understanding.",
      "But the agency leaves it to companies to decide whether to display a few keywords or a full transcript.",
      "\u201cYou often cannot put all that on the screen and expect people to read and understand it,\u201d Day said. \u201cIf you wanted to hide or decrease the likelihood of people remembering risk information, that could be the way to do it.\u201d",
      "Viewers tend to tune out long lists of warnings and other information. But experts who work with drug companies don\u2019t expect those lists to disappear. While the guidelines describe how the information should be presented, companies still decide the content.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a company and you\u2019re worried about possible FDA enforcement or product liability and other litigation, all your incentives are to say more, not less,\u201d said Torrey Cope, a food and drug lawyer who advises companies.",
      "Experts also say the new rules will have little effect on the overall tone and appearance of ads.",
      "\u201cThe most salient element of these ads are the visuals, and they are uniformly positive,\u201d said Cox. \u201cEven if the risk message is about, for instance, sudden heart failure, they\u2019re still showing someone diving into a swimming pool.\u201d",
      "The new rules come as Donald Trump's advisers begin floating plans for the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who has advised the president-elect, wants to eliminate TV drug ads. He and other industry critics point out that the U.S. and New Zealand are the only countries where prescription drugs can be promoted on TV.",
      "Even so, many companies are looking beyond TV and expanding into social media. They often partner with patient influencers who post about managing their conditions, new treatments or navigating the health system.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re teaching people to live a good life with their disease, but then some of them are also paid to advertise and persuade,\u201d said Erin Willis, who studies advertising and media at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Advertising executives say companies like the format because it\u2019s cheaper than TV and consumers generally feel influencers are more trustworthy than companies.",
      "FDA\u2019s requirement for truthful, balanced risk and benefit information applies to drugmakers, leaving a loophole for both influencers and telehealth companies like Hims, Ro and Teledoc, who may not have a direct financial connection to makers of the drugs they\u2019re promoting.",
      "The issue has attracted attention from members of Congress.",
      "\u201cThe power of social media and the deluge of misleading promotions has meant too many young people are receiving medical advice from influencers instead of their health care professional,\u201d Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mike Braun of Indiana wrote the FDA in a February letter.",
      "A recently introduced bill from the senators would bring influencers and telehealth companies clearly under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction, requiring them to disclose risk and side effect information. The bill also would require drugmakers to publicly disclose payments to influencers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s asking the FDA to take a more serious stance with this kind of marketing,\u201d said Willis. \u201cThey know it\u2019s happening, but they could be doing more.\u201d",

      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.",

He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",

      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.",

      "The World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.",
      "In a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy\u2019s personal Twitter account was the top \u201csuperspreader\u201d of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.",
      "He has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Kennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group\u2019s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series\u2019 \u201cOverall Sales Leaderboard.\u201d",
      "His group has co-published a number of anti-vaccine books that have been debunked. One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.",
      "An AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.",

      "Democratic lawmakers who wield control of the Virginia Legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrats who control both chambers of the Virginia legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access.",
      "The House Privileges and Elections Committee advanced three proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday, including a measure to protect reproductive rights. Its members also discussed measures to repeal a now-defunct state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and ways to revise Virginia's process to restore voting rights for people who served time for felony crimes.",
      "\u201cThis meeting was an important next step considering the moment in history we find ourselves in,\u201d Democratic Del. Cia Price, the committee chair, said during a news conference. \u201cWe have urgent threats to our freedoms that could impact constituents in all of the districts we serve.\u201d",
      "The at-times raucous meeting will pave the way for the House and Senate to take up the resolutions early next year after lawmakers tabled the measures last January. Democrats previously said the move was standard practice, given that amendments are typically introduced in odd-numbered years. But Republican Minority Leader Todd Gilbert said Wednesday the committee should not have delved into the amendments before next year's legislative session. He said the resolutions, particularly the abortion amendment, need further vetting.",
      "\u201cNo one who is still serving remembers it being done in this way ever,\u201d Gilbert said after the meeting. \u201cCertainly not for something this important. This is as big and weighty an issue as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Democrats' legislative lineup comes after Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, to the dismay of voting-rights advocates, rolled back a process to restore people's civil rights after they completed sentences for felonies. Virginia is the only state that permanently bans anyone convicted of a felony from voting unless a governor restores their rights.",
      "\u201cThis amendment creates a process that is bounded by transparent rules and criteria that will apply to everybody \u2014 it's not left to the discretion of a single individual,\u201d Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, the patron of the voting rights resolution, which passed along party lines, said at the news conference.",
      "Though Democrats have sparred with the governor over their legislative agenda, constitutional amendments put forth by lawmakers do not require his signature, allowing the Democrat-led House and Senate to bypass Youngkin's blessing.",
      "Instead, the General Assembly must pass proposed amendments twice in at least two years, with a legislative election sandwiched between each statehouse session. After that, the public can vote by referendum on the issues. The cumbersome process will likely hinge upon the success of all three amendments on Democrats' ability to preserve their edge in the House and Senate, where they hold razor-thin majorities.",
      "It's not the first time lawmakers have attempted to champion the three amendments. Republicans in a House subcommittee killed a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights in 2022, a year after the measure passed in a Democrat-led House. The same subcommittee also struck down legislation supporting a constitutional amendment to repeal an amendment from 2006 banning marriage equality.",
      "On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted 16-5 in favor of legislation protecting same-sex marriage, with four Republicans supporting the resolution.",
      "\u201cTo say the least, voters enacted this (amendment) in 2006, and we have had 100,000 voters a year become of voting age since then,\u201d said Del. Mark Sickles, who sponsored the amendment as one of the first openly gay men serving in the General Assembly. \u201cMany people have changed their opinions of this as the years have passed.\u201d",
      "A constitutional amendment protecting abortion previously passed the Senate in 2023 but died in a Republican-led House. On Wednesday, the amendment passed on party lines.",
      "If successful, the resolution proposed by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring would be part of a growing trend of reproductive rights-related ballot questions given to voters. Since 2022, 18 questions have gone before voters across the U.S., and they have sided with abortion rights advocates 14 times.",

      "LAHORE, Pakistan -- A Pakistani province declared a health emergency Friday due to smog and imposed a shutdown in two major cities.",
      "Smog has choked Punjab for weeks, sickening nearly 2 million people and shrouding vast swathes of the province in a toxic haze.",
      "A senior provincial minister, Marriyum Aurangzeb, declared the health emergency at a press conference and announced measures to combat the growing crisis.",
      "Time off for medical staff is cancelled, all education institutions are shut until further notice, restaurants are closing at 4 p.n. while takeaway is available up until 8 p.m. Authorities are imposing a lockdown in the cities of Multan and Lahore and halting construction work in those two places.",
      "\u201cSmog is currently a national disaster,\u201d Aurangzeb said. \u201cIt will not all be over in a month or a year. We will evaluate the situation after three days and then announce a further strategy.\u201d",

      "The Virginia-based Do No Harm filed the lawsuit earlier this month, marking the second legal battle the group has launched in the Volunteer State in the past year.",
      "In 2023, Do No Harm filed a similar federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the state's requirement that one member of the Tennessee Board of Podiatric Medical Examiners must be a racial minority. That suit was initially dismissed by a judge in August but the group has since filed an appeal to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Do No Harm is now targeting Tennessee's Board of Medical Examiners, which requires the governor to appoint at least one Black member, and Board of Chiropractic Examiners, which requires one racial minority member.",
      "In both lawsuits, Do No Harm and their attorneys with the Pacific Legal Foundation say they have clients who were denied board appointments because they weren't a minority.",
      "\u201cWhile citizens may serve on a wide array of boards and commissions, an individual\u2019s candidacy often depends on factors outside his or her control, like age or race,\" the lawsuit states. \"Sadly, for more than thirty-five years, Tennessee governors have been required to consider an individual\u2019s race when making appointments to the state\u2019s boards, commissions, and committees.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the both the medical and chiropractic boards did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. Gov. Bill Lee is named as the defendant in the lawsuit, due to his overseeing of state board appointments. His spokesperson declined to comment citing the pending litigation.",
      "More than 35 years ago, the Tennessee Legislature adopted legislation directing the governor to \u201cstrive to ensure\" that at least one member on state advisory boards are ages 60 or older and at least one member who is a \u201cmember of a racial minority.\u201d",
      "Do No Harm's lawsuit does not seek overturn the age requirement in Tennessee law.",
      "According to the suit, there are two vacancies on the Board of Medical Examiners but because all of the current members are white, Gov. Lee \u201cmust consider a potential board member\u2019s race as a factor in making his appointment decisions.\u201d",
      "Do No Harm was founded by Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, a kidney specialist and a professor emeritus and former associate dean at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s medical school. He retired in 2021 and incorporated Do No Harm \u2014 a phrase included in Hippocratic oath taken by all new physician receiving a medical degree \u2014 in 2022.",
      "That same year, Do No Harm sued Pfizer over its program for its race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent. While the suit was dismissed, Pfizer dropped the program.",
      "Meanwhile, Do No Harm has also offered model legislation to restrict gender-affirming care for youth which have been adopted by a handful of states."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 23andMe is laying off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinuing its therapeutics division as the struggling genetic testing company attempts to slash costs.",
      "The latest restructuring efforts were announced by 23andMe on Monday. The company said it plans to wind down ongoing clinical trials \u201cas quickly as practical\u201d \u2014 and that it was currently evaluating \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d for assets related to its drug development and research programs, which include studies on potential cancer treatments.",
      "In a prepared statement, 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said the company was \"taking these difficult but necessary actions\u201d as it focuses on \u201cthe long-term success of our core consumer business and research partnerships.\u201d",
      "The restructuring arrives during a period of turmoil at California-based 23andMe, which has recently included a high-profile data breach, several rounds of previous layoffs and piling losses that plunged the company's stock over recent years.",
      "Back in September, all of 23andMe\u2019s independent directors also resigned from its board \u2014 in a rare move that followed drawn-out negotiations with Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private. The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",
      "After more than a month with Wojcicki left as the sole member of the board, 23andMe announced that it had appointed three new independent directors in late October.",
      "23andMe went public in 2021 and has struggled to find a profitable business model since \u2014 particularly with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to purchase once. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",
      "Last month, 23andMe completed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Shares were down nearly 4% by midday Tuesday, sitting at around $4.43."

    "story": [
      "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

      "The 71-year-old retiree starts each morning this way with a walking club.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m obsessed,\u201d she said. Not only does it ease her joint pain, \u201cit just gives me energy \u2026 And then it calms me, too.\u201d",
      "Medical experts agree that walking is an easy way to improve physical and mental health, bolster fitness and prevent disease. While it\u2019s not the only sort of exercise people should do, it\u2019s a great first step toward a healthy life.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need equipment and you don\u2019t need a gym membership,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham. \u201cAnd the benefits are so vast.\u201d",
      "Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.",
      "Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.",
      "Another advantage? It\u2019s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.",
      "James Blankenship, 68, said joining the walking club at the Louisville Zoo last year helped him bounce back after a heart attack and triple bypass in 2022.",
      "\u201cMy cardiologist says I\u2019m doing great,\u201d he said.",
      "For all its benefits, however, walking \u201cis not enough for overall health and well-being\u201d because it doesn\u2019t provide resistance training that builds muscle strength and endurance, said Anita Gust, who teaches exercise science at the University of Minnesota Crookston.",
      "That's especially important for women\u2019s bone health as they age.",

      "Nearly everyone has heard about this walking goal, which dates back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. But experts stress that it\u2019s just a guideline.",
      "The average American walks about 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day and it's fine to gradually work up to 10,000, Shmied said.",
      "Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests breaking the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During inclement weather, people can walk in malls or on treadmills.",
      "As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up the pace or challenge themselves with hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.",

      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "The dangerous smog is a byproduct of large numbers of vehicles, construction and industrial work as well as burning crops at the start of the winter wheat-planting season, experts say.",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",

      "A pregnant woman has filed a lawsuit seeking the right to an abortion in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to restore the right to an abortion in Kentucky in the latest challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, claims that Kentucky laws blocking abortions violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy and self-determination. It asks that both state laws be struck down by a judge in Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The woman, a state resident identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy, is about seven weeks pregnant, the suit said. She wants to terminate her pregnancy but cannot legally do so in Kentucky, it said.",
      "The decision about whether to become or remain pregnant is among the \u201cmost personal and consequential decisions a person will make in their lifetime,\u201d the suit said. Her legal team includes attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d Amiri said in a statement.",
      "The plaintiff in the new lawsuit said the decision whether to end her pregnancy should be hers.",
      "\"I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- The decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "There were about 97,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period that ended June 30, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the previous 12-month period.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,\u201d said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday showed that the downward trend has kept going.",
      "Of course, there have been moments in the last several years when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again, Marshall noted.",
      "\u201cThis seems to be substantial and sustained,\u201d Marshall said. \"I think there's real reason for hope here.\"",
      "Experts aren't certain about the reasons for the decline, but they cite a combination of possible factors.",
      "One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated \u2014 with no one around to help if they overdosed.",
      "\u201cDuring the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose deaths that it\u2019s only natural we would see a decrease,\u201d said Farida Ahmad of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose trends.",
      "Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on naloxone and other measures.",
      "Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply. Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it's affecting overdoses.",
      "In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states. Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.",
      "The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags in getting death records to federal statisticians \u2014 particularly North Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of understaffing at the state medical examiner's office. The CDC made estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as initial numbers suggest.",
      "Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn't detail what's happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing disproportionately larger.",
      "\u201cWe really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,\" Marshall said.",

      "A Hong Kong court on Thursday sentenced the mastermind of a failed bomb plot during anti-government protests in December 2019 to nearly 24 years in jail",
      "HONG KONG -- The mastermind behind a foiled bomb plot during anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019 has been jailed for nearly 24 years in the city's first case brought under an anti-terrorism law.",
      "Ng Chi-hung, who had previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit the bombing of prescribed objects under the anti-terror law and possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life, was sentenced to 23 years and 10 months by a Hong Kong court on Thursday.",
      "He was among seven convicted defendants who appeared in court for their roles in the plot to plant two bombs and shoot officers along a rally route on Dec. 8, 2019, at a time when accusations of police brutality in handling protesters were widespread.",
      "Judge Judianna Barnes said the plan was vicious and was a declaration of war on society.",
      "The seven are not well-known activists in the semi-autonomous Chinese city\u2019s pro-democracy movement, but their case has drawn attention because the United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance was invoked.",
      "Hong Kong enacted the law to implement a U.N. Security Council resolution passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.",
      "According to local media, prosecutors said most of the defendants in the case were members of two groups \u2014 one led by Ng and another called \u201cDragon-Slaying Brigade.\" The prosecution said members of the brigade planned to lure police officers onto an area where bombs would be detonated and a sniper would target them.",
      "Wong Chun-keung, leader of the brigade, was sentenced to more than 13 years. Five other defendants received prison terms ranging from nearly six years to 12 years.",
      "In August, six other defendants, who had pleaded not guilty, were acquitted by a panel of jurors.",
      "Steve Li, chief superintendent for the police's national security department, said he would study the judgment and consider whether to appeal some sentencing decisions. He also criticized those convicted as deranged.",
      "The 2019 protests marked the most concerted challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Following the protests, more than 10,000 people have been arrested in connection with the often-violent social unrest sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China."

      "He has also suggested that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and southern Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral, and says that he calls a Catholic parish in Gaza every day to check in on the people it is sheltering.",

    "summary": "More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants have denounced Italy&rsquo;s migration deal with Albania as a violation of the code of medical ethics",
    "story": [
      "More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants have denounced Italy\u2019s migration deal with Albania as a violation of the code of medical ethics",
      "ROME -- More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants denounced Italy\u2019s migration deal with Albania on Friday as a violation of the code of medical ethics, and urged health workers not to cooperate with it.",
      "The deal, the centerpiece of Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s crackdown on human trafficking, calls for some male migrants rescued at sea to have their asylum cases processed while they are detained at two holding centers in Albania, a non-EU nation.",
      "Italy, which has long demanded Europe shoulder more of the continent\u2019s migration problem, has held up the deal with Albania as a model for the continent and a strong deterrent to would-be refugees setting out on smugglers\u2019 boats from North Africa for a better life.",
      "But the five-year deal, which is budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million), has run into a series of obstacles and legal challenges that have prevented even a single migrant from being processed in Albania.",
      "First, construction delays prevented the opening of the centers for several months. Then, after the first two batches of 20 men were brought to Albania this month, Italian courts issued rulings that resulted in them being taken to Italy anyway.",
      "The matter is now before the European Union\u2019s Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which has been asked to rule on whether the men come from countries deemed safe for return. All 20 hail from Bangladesh and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, the non-governmental organizations released a detailed analysis of the procedures to screen migrants first on Italian naval ships, and then in the Albanian centers, to determine if they are \u201cvulnerable.\u201d Only men deemed to be not \u201cvulnerable\u201d are to be sent to Albania.",
      "The aid groups said there were no proper facilities or instruments to make such a determination. And regardless, practically everyone who has set off on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing has endured the type of physical, psychological or sexual abuse that should disqualify them from Albanian detention, they said.",
      "The migrants should be considered at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder or other serious physical and mental health consequences, they said.",
      "The groups criticized the international organizations that are apparently cooperating with the project, identifying the International Organization of Migration and the Knights of Malta\u2019s Italian rescue corps as being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in human rights violations.",
      "\u201cThe Italy-Albania Protocol violates the code of medical ethics and human rights and puts the physical and psychological health of migrants at risk,\" the statement said.",
      "There was no immediate reply to emails sent to the IOM or the Knights' press offices seeking comment.",
      "The Italian government has said the rights of the migrants would be fully guaranteed in the Albanian centers and the deal has been blessed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of \u201cout-of-box thinking\u201d to tackle the migration issue. But human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent and represents a violation of Italy's obligations under international law.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency has agreed to supervise the first three months of the agreement and one of its teams is conducting an \u201cindependent mission\u201d on board the transfer ship to monitor the screening process.",
      "The legal challenges have come despite the small number of people impacted so far. Even though the centers were built to house as many as 3,000 migrants a month, just 20 were transferred in the first two separate ship passages, only to be sent to Italy after the Rome courts intervened.",
      "The statement was signed by Doctors\u2019 Without Borders, Emergency, Sea-Watch, SOS Mediterranee and other aid groups."

      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has made many countries anxious and recalculating where they stand with the U.S., but India appears to be welcoming the change that may embolden nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi",
      "NEW DELHI -- Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has made many countries anxious and recalculating where they stand with the U.S., but India appears to be welcoming the change that may embolden nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\u201cI know today a lot of countries are nervous about the U.S., let\u2019s be honest about that,\u201d India\u2019s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said over the weekend. India was \u201cnot one of them.\u201d A call from Modi \u201cwas among the first three calls, I think, that President (elect) Trump took,\" he added.",
      "A second Trump presidency is likely to play out in New Delhi\u2019s favor, experts say, especially as Modi seeks to reset India\u2019s relationship with the West after recent frictions over his refusal to join sanctions against Russia or condemn its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Modi has also been criticized over India's democratic backsliding.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s victory means that the Indian policies that have put New Delhi at odds with the West \u2026 will no longer be a cause of concern for Washington,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center.",
      "There could be ruptures on trade, immigration and climate change goals \u2014 but on balance, \u201cthe return of Trump means that India\u2019s relations with the West \u2013 and specifically its most powerful country \u2014 will get a boost,\u201d he added.",
      "Modi has sought to cast India as a rising global player with a fast-growing economy that can counter China. But critics say his authoritarian politics and right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party have deeply polarized the country with minorities increasingly marginalized and the right to free speech and press under attack.",
      "When President Joe Biden honored Modi with a state visit last year, he walked a tightrope as activists and groups pressured him to confront Modi over his human rights record. Still, the two leaders rolled out new business deals on defense and technology.",
      "Such concerns won't be an issue with Trump, said Uday Chandra, assistant professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar. \u201cHe is a refreshing reset from the Indian perspective \u2026 he is much more transactional.\u201d",
      "Trump, long an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is also likely to be more understanding of India\u2019s strategic partnership with Moscow, which dates back to the Cold War, its record purchases of Russian crude, and its refusal to pick a side in the war in Ukraine. \u201cThis was the real sort of thorn in India-U.S. relations over the past two years \u2026 but with Trump, I don\u2019t see this being an issue,\u201d Chandra said.",
      "One hot-button issue is trade. In his first term, trade differences between the two countries came to the fore with Trump calling India the \u201ctariff king\u201d over disagreements on farm goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and medical devices. In 2019, he canceled the country's special trade privileges and India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen U.S. goods.",
      "This time, Trump wants to impose a \u201cuniversal\u201d tax of 10% or 20% on all imports and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60%. India, which counts the U.S. as its second-largest trading partner, won't be an exception.",
      "\u201cNew Delhi will have to do more than just tinkering with its policies to deal with Trump\u2019s emphasis on fair trade,\u201d said C Rajamohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "Immigration could turn into a sore point if Trump attempts to also curb skilled migration. Indians have often been the largest group applying for the H1-B work visa but Trump had called the visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers.",
      "Progress on climate change and clean energy could also be hit.",
      "\u201cIndia and the U.S. have done quite a lot on this front over the past four years \u2014 but this is something that could unravel because a Trump administration is more aligned with the fossil fuel industry than with green technology,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, South Asia Program director at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Both Trump and Modi embody strongmen tactics, count on an impassioned support base and have ramped up polarization to consolidate votes. And unlike liberal leaders in the West, Trump doesn\u2019t view Modi\u2019s policies at home problematic \u2013 or even relevant, said Kugelman.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both ardent nationalists committed to making their nations stronger at home and abroad,\u201d he added.",
      "Analysts also point to the personal bond between the two. When Trump visited India in 2020, Modi threw him an event in the world's largest cricket stadium.",
      "The year before that, Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power at a joint rally in Texas. In his congratulatory post to Trump on X last week, Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging, smiling and holding hands.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bromance between the two,\u201d said Chandra. \"But they're also united by a shared worldview \u2014 that we are in a post- liberal world and that liberalism as an ideology for conducting global politics is no longer viable. That\u2019s as true in India as it is in America.\u201d"

      "The men were \u201cvictims of forced disappearance by members of the Guatemalan army,\u201d the court\u2019s decision said, adding that the state did not investigate, judge or sanction those responsible.",
      "The Costa Rica-based court said in its ruling that the Guatemalan government must take the steps necessary to establish what happened to the victims and punish those responsible.",
      "Agapito P\u00e9rez Lucas, Nicol\u00e1s Mateo, Macario P\u00fa Chival\u00e1n and Luis Ruiz Luis had been threatened by government agents for their human rights work, the court said.",
      "They disappeared in April 1989, during the first civilian presidency of Vinicio Cerezo after decades of military leadership, and amid Guatemala\u2019s 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.",
      "A United Nations truth commission established that more than 200,000 people from both sides died in the conflict and some 45,000 disappeared.",

    "story": [
      "Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, asked Iran to help secure a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah",
      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister on Friday asked Iran to help secure a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border.",
      "The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Larijani\u2019s visit to Lebanon comes as the United States continued pushing both sides to agree to a deal to end 13 months of exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah and for decades has been funding and arming the Lebanese militant group. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza \u2013 prompting exchanges between the two sides ever since.",
      "Since late September, Israel dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and end its barrages in Israel. More than 3,300 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire \u2013 80% of them in the past month -- Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry says.",
      "According to Lebanese media, U.S. Ambassador Lisa Johnson handed over a draft of a proposed cease-fire deal to Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who has been leading the talks representing Hezbollah.",
      "A Lebanese official confirmed that Beirut has received a copy of a draft proposal based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war, in the summer of 2006.",
      "That resolution, among other things, said that only the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers should operate in southern Lebanon, meaning Hezbollah would have to end its presence there. That provision was never implemented. Lebanon accuses Israel of also violating the resolution by maintaining hold of a small, disputed border area and conducting frequent military overflights over Lebanon.",
      "The Lebanese official did not give details other than to say Israel was insisting that some guarantees be included. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks.",
      "The U.S. Embassy refused to either confirm or deny the reports.",
      "In talks with Larijani, caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged Iran to help implement resolution 1701. He said the Lebanese government wants the war to end and the resolution to be implemented \u201cin all its details,\u201d according to a statement on the talks issued by his office.",
      "Mikati, who in recent weeks has become more critical of Iran\u2019s role in Lebanon, also said the government wants Iran to help Lebanon\u2019s national unity and not take any stance backing one party against another.",
      "Iran\u2019s backing for Hezbollah has helped the group, which is the most powerful faction among Lebanon\u2019s Shiite Muslims, dominate the country\u2019s politics the last decade.",
      "After meeting Mikati and Berri, Larijani said his visit\u2019s main aim was \u201cto loudly say that we will stand by Lebanon\u2019s government and people.\u201d",
      "Asked if he was trying to thwart U.S. cease-fire mediation, Larijani said, \u201cWe are not trying to blow up any effort, but we want to solve the problem and we will stand by Lebanon, whatever the circumstances.\u201d",
      "Larijani held similar talks a day earlier in Syria with President Bashar Assad. Syria\u2019s state news agency said that Assad and Larijani discussed the \u201congoing aggression on Palestine and Lebanon and the necessity of stopping it.\u201d",
      "While Larijani was in Beirut, Israeli forces carried out a new strike on the southeastern edge of the city.",
      "Images taken by an Associated Press photographer showed a rocket about to strike an 11-story residential building in Beirut\u2019s Tayouneh neighborhood \u2013 then a blast of flame erupts from the side of the building. Much of a lower level of the building was smashed to rubble.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military had issued a warning before the attack, saying it was a facility that belonged to Hezbollah.",
      "Near the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, rescue teams continued searching through the rubble Friday at the site of an Israeli strike the night before that hit a civil defense center in the town of Douris.",
      "So far, the bodies of 13 employees and volunteers with the Lebanese Civil Defense had a been recovered, the agency said, as well as some other remains that will require DNA testing.",
      "Israel expanded its operations in Lebanon even as it continues its campaign in the Gaza Strip, vowing to destroy Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.",
      "Funerals were held Friday for 11 Palestinians killed Thursday in a series of Israeli airstrikes in and around the central Gaza Strip city of Deir al-Balah. Two children were among the dead, seen with the other dead by an AP reporter.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council\u2019s 10 elected members circulated a draft resolution demanding \u201can immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire\u201d in Gaza. The U.S., Israel\u2019s closest ally, holds the key to whether the U.N. Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members \u2014 Russia, China, Britain and France \u2014 are expected to support it or abstain.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and abducting 250 others.",
      "Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives since then have killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say. The officials don\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants but say more than half of those killed have been women and children.",

    "summary": "A vote in New Zealand&rsquo;s parliament was suspended and two lawmakers ejected Thursday amid debate over a controversial proposed law redefining the country&rsquo;s founding agreement between Indigenous M&#257;ori and the British Crown",
    "story": [
      "A vote in New Zealand\u2019s parliament was suspended and two lawmakers ejected Thursday amid debate over a controversial proposed law redefining the country\u2019s founding agreement between Indigenous M\u0101ori and the British Crown",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A vote in New Zealand\u2019s parliament was suspended and two lawmakers ejected on Thursday when dramatic political theater erupted over a controversial proposed law redefining the country\u2019s founding agreement between Indigenous M\u0101ori and the British Crown.",
      "Under the principles laid out in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which guide the relationship between the government and M\u0101ori, tribes were promised broad rights to retain their lands and protect their interests in return for ceding governance to the British. The bill would specify that those rights should apply to all New Zealanders.",
      "The bill has scant support and is unlikely to become law. Detractors say it threatens racial discord and constitutional upheaval, while thousands of New Zealanders are traveling the length of the country this week to protest it.",
      "Despite its unpopularity, however, the proposed law passed its first vote on Thursday after dominating public discussion for months, due to a quirk of New Zealand\u2019s political system that allows tiny parties to negotiate outsized influence for their agendas. It also reflects unease among some New Zealanders about more rapid progress in recent years toward upholding the promises made to M\u0101ori when the country was colonized.",
      "For decades after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, differences between the English and M\u0101ori texts and breaches by New Zealand governments intensified the disenfranchisement of M\u0101ori.",
      "By the middle of the 20th century, Indigenous language and culture had dwindled, much tribal land was confiscated and M\u0101ori were disadvantaged on every metric. As the Indigenous protest movement surged in the 1970s, lawmakers and the courts slowly began to elucidate what it understood the treaty to promise M\u0101ori: partnership with the Crown, participation in decision-making and protection of their interests.",
      "\u201cWhat all of these principles have in common is that they afford M\u0101ori different rights from other New Zealanders,\u201d David Seymour, leader of minor libertarian party ACT and the bill\u2019s author, said Thursday.",
      "To those who have championed the treaty, that is the point. Work has involved billion-dollar land settlements, embrace of the M\u0101ori language, guaranteed representation in central and local government and attempts through policy to reverse the stark inequities Indigenous people still face.",
      "But Seymour \u2013 who is M\u0101ori -- said no law or court had actually settled for good a definition of the treaty\u2019s principles, and that had caused division. His bill filled \u201ca silence this parliament has left for five decades,\u201d he said.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon disagrees, but his party voted for the bill Thursday to fulfil the political deal with Seymour that handed Luxon power. Without enough seats to govern after last October's election, Luxon curried support from two minor parties \u2013 including Seymour's ACT, which won less than 9% of the vote \u2013 in return for political concessions.",
      "Luxon told Seymour his party would vote for the treaty bill once, while promising publicly that it would go no further.",
      "The treaty\u2019s principles had been negotiated and debated for 184 years, Luxon told reporters Thursday, and it was \u201csimplistic\u201d for Seymour to suggest that they could be resolved \u201cthrough the stroke of a pen\u201d.",
      "Government lawmakers made awkward speeches in parliament explaining that they opposed the bill before voting for it to jeers from opponents, who demanded they break ranks. Luxon was spared that; he left the country for the meeting of leaders from the Asia-Pacific APEC bloc hours before the vote.",
      "His political horse-trading drew scorn from opposition lawmakers.",
      "\u201cShame! Shame! Shame on you, David Seymour,\u201d roared Willie Jackson, a veteran M\u0101ori lawmaker. \u201cShame on you for what you\u2019re trying to do to this nation.\u201d",
      "Jackson was thrown out of the debating chamber by Speaker Gerry Brownlee for calling Seymour a liar.",
      "\u201cYou are complicit in the harm and the division that this presents,\u201d said Rawiri Waititi, a lawmaker from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, an Indigenous group, speaking to all who advanced the bill.",
      "\u201cIf you vote for this bill, this is who you are,\u201d Green party leader Chloe Swarbrick told Luxon's lawmakers.",
      "No one deviated from their planned votes and the bill passed. But not before one final flashpoint.",
      "When asked how her party\u2019s lawmakers would vote, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori stood and began a ringing haka \u2013 a rhythmic M\u0101ori chant of challenge \u2013 which swelled to a roar as first opposition lawmakers, and then spectators in the public gallery, joined in.",
      "An irate Brownlee was unable to quiet the fracas as opponents approached Seymour\u2019s seat. The live broadcast of Parliament\u2019s proceedings was cut and Brownlee ordered the public be removed before the vote resumed.",
      "He suspended Maipi-Clarke, 22, from Parliament for a day.",
      "The bill will proceed to a public submission process before another vote. Seymour hopes for an outpouring of support to change Luxon's mind about vetoing it.",
      "The proposal will shortly roil Parliament again. Thousands of protesters are due to arrive in the capital, Wellington, on Tuesday for what is likely to be one of the largest race relations marches in New Zealand\u2019s history."

      "Recent data show wages and employment are improving. Spending was lower than the previous quarter, partly because of severe weather that crimped spending and shut down some factories. Recent income tax reductions helped boost spending.",
      "Exports grew 1.5%. The weakening yen is a plus for exports, tending to make Japanese products cheaper overseas. But the impact was relatively limited in the latest quarter. The Japanese yen was trading at 160-yen levels earlier this year. It\u2019s now trading at 150-yen levels.",
      "Prior to the last two quarters, the economy contracted 0.6% in the January-March quarter after recording a 0.1% growth in October-December in 2023, highlighting how Japan\u2019s economy recently slipped into periods of contraction in between weak expansion.",

      "Unlike the U.S. and other developed nations grappling with inflationary pressures, Japan struggled with years of deflation, or a continuous cascading down of prices that underlines a fragile economy. Inflation stood at 2.5% in September.",
      "Market watchers are also focused on when the central bank might move next on interest rates. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero or below zero for years to wrest the economy out of deflation but is gradually raising them.",

      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",

      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",

      "Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 promptly sacked Bero\u0161 from the government, HRT state television said. Croatian media reported that police raided Bero\u0161' home in Zagreb early on Friday.",
      "\u201cI am appalled by the idea that anyone in the health system would use their position for personal gains or for favors to anyone else,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 said at a press conference. \u201cThe health system is a particularly sensitive department.",

    "story": [
      "Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure.",
      "Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 rose 0.2% from September to October, up from a 0.1% gain the month before. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices were up 2.4%, accelerating from a year-over-year gain of 1.9% in September.",
      "A 0.3% increase in services prices drove the October increase. Wholesale goods prices edged up 0.1% after falling the previous two months. Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to bounce around from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.3 from September and 3.1% from a year earlier. The readings were about what economists had expected.",
      "Since peaking in mid-2022, inflation has fallen more or less steadily. But average prices are still nearly 20% higher than they were three years ago \u2014 a persistent source of public exasperation that led to Donald Trump's defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris in last week's presidential election and the return of Senate control to Republicans.",
      "The October report on producer prices comes a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 2.6% last month from a year earlier, a sign that inflation at the consumer level might be leveling off after having slowed in September to its slowest pace since 2021. Most economists, though, say they think inflation will eventually resume its slowdown.",
      "Inflation has been moving toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% year-over-year target, and the central bank\u2019s inflation fighters have been satisfied enough with the improvement to cut their benchmark interest rate twice since September \u2014 a reversal in policy after they raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory has raised doubts about the future path of inflation and whether the Fed will continue to cut rates. In September, the Fed all but declared victory over inflation and slashed its benchmark interest rate by an unusually steep half-percentage point, its first rate cut since March 2020, when the pandemic was hammering the economy. Last week, the central bank announced a second rate cut, a more typical quarter-point reduction.",
      "Though Trump has vowed to force prices down, in part by encouraging oil and gas drilling, some of his other campaign vows \u2014 to impose massive taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working illegally in the United States \u2014 are seen as inflationary by mainstream economists. Still, Wall Street traders see an 82% likelihood of a third rate cut when the Fed next meets in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",
      "The producer price index released Thursday can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Stephen Brown at Capital Economics wrote in a commentary that higher wholesale airfares, investment fees and healthcare prices in October would push core PCE prices higher than the Fed would like to see. But he said the increase wouldn\u2019t be enough \u201cto justify a pause (in rate cuts) by the Fed at its next meeting in December.\u2033",
      "Inflation began surging in 2021 as the economy accelerated with surprising speed out of the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to a 23-year high. The resulting much higher borrowing costs were expected to tip the United States into recession. It didn\u2019t happen. The economy kept growing, and employers kept hiring. And, for the most part, inflation has kept slowing.",

    "story": [
      "One of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota, officials announced Thursday.",
      "An investigation by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry found that the Smithfield Packaged Meats subsidiary employed at least 11 children at its plant in St. James ages 14 to 17 from April 2021 through April 2023, the agency said. Three of them began working for the company when they were 14, it said. Smithfield let nine of them work after allowable hours and had all 11 perform potentially dangerous work, the agency alleged.",
      "As part of the settlement, Smithfield also agreed to steps to ensure future compliance with child labor laws. U.S. law prohibits companies from employing people younger than 18 to work in meat processing plants because of hazards.",
      "State Labor Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach said the agreement \"sends a strong message to employers, including in the meat processing industry, that child labor violations will not be tolerated in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "The Smithfield, Virginia-based company said in a statement that it denies knowingly hiring anyone under age 18 to work at the St. James plant, and that it did not admit liability under the settlement. The company said all 11 passed the federal E-Verify employment eligibility system by using false identification. Smithfield also said it takes a long list of proactive steps to enforce its policy prohibiting the employment of minors.",
      "\u201cSmithfield is committed to maintaining a safe workplace and complying with all applicable employment laws and regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly agree that individuals under the age of 18 have no place working in meatpacking or processing facilities.\u201d",
      "The state agency said the $2 million administrative penalty is the largest it has recovered in a child labor enforcement action. It also ranks among the larger recent child labor settlements nationwide. It follows a $300,000 agreement that Minnesota reached last year with another meat processer, Tony Downs Food Co., after the agency's investigation found it employed children as young as 13 at its plant in Madelia.",
      "Also last year, the U.S. Department of Labor levied over $1.5 million in civil penalties against one of the country\u2019s largest cleaning services for food processing companies, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., after finding it employed more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country.",
      "After that investigation, the Biden administration urged U.S. meat processors to make sure they aren't illegally hiring children for dangerous jobs. The call, in a letter by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to the 18 largest meat and poultry producers, was part of a broader crackdown on child labor. The Labor Department then reported a 69% increase since 2018 in the number of children being employed illegally in the U.S.",
      "In other recent settlements, a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, agreed in August to a $165,000 settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s economy eked out an annual rate of 0.9% growth in the July-September period as consumer spending held up, government data showed Friday.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest economy grew 0.2% in the fiscal second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of expansion, following 0.5% growth in April-June.",
      "Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP, measures the value of a nation\u2019s products and services. The annual rate shows how much the economy would have grown or contracted, if the quarterly rate continued for a year.",
      "Domestic demand grew at an annualized rate of 2.5%. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan\u2019s GDP, grew 3.6% on the back of healthy household consumption, according to preliminary Cabinet Office data.",
      "Recent data show wages and employment are improving. Spending was lower than the previous quarter, partly because of severe weather that crimped spending and shut down some factories. Recent income tax reductions helped boost spending.",
      "Exports grew 1.5%. The weakening yen is a plus for exports, tending to make Japanese products cheaper overseas. But the impact was relatively limited in the latest quarter. The Japanese yen was trading at 160-yen levels earlier this year. It\u2019s now trading at 150-yen levels.",
      "Prior to the last two quarters, the economy contracted 0.6% in the January-March quarter after recording a 0.1% growth in October-December in 2023, highlighting how Japan\u2019s economy recently slipped into periods of contraction in between weak expansion.",
      "\u201cWe believe the Japanese economy will continue to grow gradually, supported by growth in overseas economies,\u201d said Katsutoshi Inadome, senior strategist at SuMi Trust.",
      "He noted winter bonuses many Japanese get in coming months should also help strengthen domestic demand.",
      "As for headwinds, Japan is facing political uncertainty with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba having to survive a runoff this week to remain in office but now facing an emboldened opposition.",
      "Unlike the U.S. and other developed nations grappling with inflationary pressures, Japan struggled with years of deflation, or a continuous cascading down of prices that underlines a fragile economy. Inflation stood at 2.5% in September.",
      "Market watchers are also focused on when the central bank might move next on interest rates. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero or below zero for years to wrest the economy out of deflation but is gradually raising them.",

      "The purchase of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga",
      "The purchase of Alex Jones ' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga between the far-right conspiracy theorist and families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.",
      "The sale was ordered after relatives of many of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 shooting successfully sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress. Jones repeatedly made false claims on his show that the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Here are some things to know about how Jones' misinformation empire ended up on the auction block.",
      "Fresh out of high school in the early 1990s, Jones, a barrel-chested, gravelly voiced Texas native, started broadcasting on a public-access television channel in the state capital. From the start, Jones promoted conspiracies about the U.S. government and false claims about a secret New World Order.",
      "In 2004, Jones had two employees and a tiny office in south Austin. In 2007, he formed Free Speech Systems, to run his growing media business, according to court records in his bankruptcy cases. By 2010, Jones had over 60 employees.",
      "As the outlandish nature of his false claims grew, so did his media empire, with annual revenues of up to $80 million, and a fanbase that at his height listened to him on more than 100 radio stations across the United States as well as through his Infowars website and social media.",
      "Jones has acknowledged in court that he promoted the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated in part by the U.S. government as part of an effort to expand gun control. He called the parents of slain children \u201ccrisis actors\u201d on his show and said the shooting was \u201cphony as a three-dollar bill.\u201d",
      "After separate defamation lawsuits were filed in Connecticut and Texas by family members of victims, Jones acknowledged in 2022 that the shooting was \u201c100% real\u201d and said it was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d to call it a hoax.",
      "Victims\u2019 families who sued Jones said they were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on his show.",
      "Courts in Texas and Connecticut found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax and awarded the families nearly $1.5 billion in damages. In both states, the judges issued default judgments finding Jones liable without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over many documents. Juries then heard evidence and decided on the amount of damages, with judges tacking on additional penalties.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment. Up for sale was everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras.",
      "The Onion acquired Infowars' website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; and video archive. The sale price was not disclosed.",
      "After the sale was announced, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location.",
      "Jones vowed to challenge the sale and auction process in court, and late Thursday a federal judge ordered a hearing into exactly how The Onion won the bidding. Lawyers for Jones and a company affiliated with Infowars alleged the trustee overseeing the auction changed the bidding process just days before it was held."

      "Chair Jerome Powell says the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed\u2019s officials want to see where it heads next",
      "WASHINGTON -- Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed's officials want to see where it heads next.",
      "Powell, speaking in Dallas, said that inflation is edging closer to the central bank's 2% target, \u201cbut it is not there yet.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the economy is strong, and the policymakers can take time to monitor the path of inflation.",
      "\u201cThe economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,\u201d the Fed chair said. \u201cThe strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully.\u201d",
      "Economists expect the Fed to announce another quarter-point rate cut in December, after a quarter-point reduction last week and half-point cut in September.",
      "But the Fed's steps after that are much less clear. In September, the central bank's officials collectively signaled that they envisioned cutting their key rate four times in 2025. Wall Street traders, though, now expect just two rate reductions, according to futures pricing tracked by CME FedWatch. And after Powell's cautious remarks Thursday, traders estimated the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in December at just below 59%, down from 83% a day earlier.",
      "The Fed's benchmark interest rate tends to influence borrowing rates across the economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Other factors, though, can also push up longer-term rates, notably expectations for inflation and economic growth.",
      "For example, Donald Trump's presidential election victory has sent yields on Treasury securities higher. It is a sign that investors expect faster growth next year as well as potentially larger budget deficits and even higher inflation should Trump impose widespread tariffs and mass deportations of migrants as he has promised.",
      "In his remarks Thursday, Powell suggested that inflation may remain stuck somewhat above the Fed's target in the coming months. But he reiterated that inflation should eventually decline further, \u201calbeit on a sometimes bumpy path.\u201d",
      "Under questioning, Powell also explained why he considers the Fed's role as an independent federal agency to be crucial to its ability to fight inflation. During his first term, Trump threatened to try to fire Powell for not cutting interest rates. And during this year\u2019s election campaign, Trump asserted that as president, he should have a \u201csay\u201d on the Fed's rate policies.",
      "Powell said Thursday that the Fed's independence from political concerns has made the public confident that the policymakers will keep inflation low over time. That confidence, in turn, has helped reduce inflation after it had spiked in the wake of the pandemic. When consumers and businesses expect inflation to slow, they act in ways that help hold it down \u2014 by, for example, not demanding high cost-of-living raises.",
      "\u201cThe public,\" Powell said, \"believed that we would get inflation down, that we would restore price stability. And that\u2019s ultimately the key to it.\u201d",
      "Powell declined to comment on other political topics, including the potential impacts of Trump's proposals to impose sweeping tariffs and implement mass deport",
      "Other Fed officials have also recently expressed uncertainty about how much more they can cut rates, given the economy\u2019s steady growth and the apparent stickiness of inflation.",
      "As measured by the central bank\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, have been stuck in the high 2% range for five months.",
      "On Wednesday, Lorie Logan, president of the Fed\u2019s Dallas branch, said it was not clear how much more the Fed should cut its key short-term rate.",
      "\u201cIf we cut too far ... inflation could reaccelerate and the (Fed) could need to reverse direction,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s best to proceed with caution.\u201d"

      "But management changes came anyway in September, when former CEO Alan Shaw was fired for having an inappropriate relationship with the railroad's chief legal officer. CFO Mark George was promoted to lead the railroad alongside the new operating chief who was hired in the spring in the middle of the fight with Ancora.",
      "George has said he doesn't plan to abandon the strategy Shaw outlined, which aims to maintain more resources on hand during economic downturns so the railroad can provide better service and be prepared to respond to increased shipments when the economy eventually recovers. But George also signaled that he won't tolerate mediocrity and will keep the pressure on to make the railroad more profitable and efficient.",

      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "The companies agreed to a $8.5 billion deal in August 2023 that would have united Capri, the maker of Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors shoes, handbags and accessories, with Tapestry, which produces the same products under the Coach, Kate Spade New York, and Stuart Weitzman brands.",
      "But the deal has faced numerous obstacles.",
      "In April, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block Tapestry's acquisition of Capri, saying the deal would eliminate direct competition between the companies\u2019 brands in the so-called affordable luxury handbag arena.",

      "Last month, a U.S. District judge halted the merger, saying it would reduce competition and hurt consumers.",
      "Tapestry and Capri filed a notice to jointly appeal the decision, but Tapestry said Thursday the outcome of the legal process is \u201cuncertain and unlikely to be resolved by the February 10, 2025 outside date.\u201d",

      "ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's health minister and several others were detained on Friday on suspicion of corruption as part of an investigation launched by the European prosecutor's office, authorities said.",
      "Minister Vili Bero\u0161, the directors of two hospitals in the capital Zagreb, and two companies are suspected of \"accepting and giving bribes, abuse of position and authority and money laundering,\" the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, or EPPO, in Zagreb said in a statement.",
      "Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 promptly sacked Bero\u0161 from the government, HRT state television said. Croatian media reported that police raided Bero\u0161' home in Zagreb early on Friday.",
      "\u201cI am appalled by the idea that anyone in the health system would use their position for personal gains or for favors to anyone else,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 said at a press conference. \u201cThe health system is a particularly sensitive department.",
      "\u201cWe as a government have not and will not protect anyone from criminal prosecution if they are suspected of committing criminal acts, regardless of who that may be or which duty they have,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 said.",
      "Bero\u0161' lawyer Laura Valkovi\u0107 said he denied wrongdoing.",
      "Croatia has had severe problems with systemic and political corruption. Among the 27 European Union member countries, it is generally ranked by international anti-graft groups as one of the most corrupt states.",
      "The EPPO statement said that five of the suspects between June 2022 and Nov. 2024 \u201cteamed up\u201d to secure undue financial gains for two companies by promising and giving monetary rewards to relevant stakeholders.",
      "\u201cTheir goal was to ensure that one of the companies was allowed to sell medical robotic devices for several hospitals in Croatia,\u201d the statement added. The group was also suspected of offering bribes to manipulate the public procurement process and exclude market competition in favor of that company.",
      "\u201cOther suspects offered and handed over bribes to several relevant stakeholders in the public health system, including the minister of health and the directors of two hospitals, to gain their support for different contracts\" funded by the EU or Croatia's national budget, said the EPPO statement.",
      "This was attempted on at least four occasions but didn't work in the case of an EU-funded project in the coastal town of Split, where the responsible person refused the offered bribe, the prosecutors said.",
      "In the other three cases in various hospitals in Zagreb, the statement said the health minister allegedly approved the purchase of microscopes at prices that were increased by 619,583 euros ($654,000) in exchange of a bribe.",
      "The EPPO is the independent public prosecutors' office of the European Union. It\u202fis responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the EU.",
      "Croatia's State Attorney Ivan Turudi\u0107 criticized the EU prosecutors for allegedly not informing Croatia's anti-graft authorities that they are also investigating Bero\u0161 and the others. He said that he will decide who is responsible for the entire case.",
      "The EPPO stated that they suspected Bero\u0161 of receiving bribes, while Turudi\u0107 said Croatian investigators are accusing him of the lesser crime of \u201cinfluence peddling.\""

      "The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued the first round of permits allowing Enbridge to reroute an aging pipeline around a tribal reservation",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Enbridge's contentious plan to reroute an aging pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation moved closer to reality Thursday after the company won its first permits from state regulators.",
      "Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials announced they have issued construction permits for the Line 5 reroute around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The energy company still needs discharge permits from the DNR as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "The project has generated fierce opposition. The tribe wants the pipeline off its land, but tribal members and environmentalists maintain rerouting construction will damage the region's watershed and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels.",
      "The DNR issued the construction permits with more than 200 conditions attached. The company must complete the project by Nov. 14, 2027, hire DNR-approved environmental monitors and allow DNR employees to access the site during reasonable hours.",
      "The company also must notify the agency within 24 hours of any permit violations or hazardous material spills affecting wetlands or waterways; can\u2019t discharge any drilling mud into wetlands, waterways or sensitive areas; keep spill response equipment at workspace entry and exit points; and monitor for the introduction and spread in invasive plant species.",
      "Enbridge officials issued a statement praising the approval, calling it a \u201cmajor step\u201d toward construction that will keep reliable energy flowing to Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region.",
      "Bad River tribal officials warned in their own statement Thursday that the project calls for blasting, drilling and digging trenches that would devastate area wetlands and streams and endanger the tribe's wild rice beds. The tribe noted that investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the Line 3 pipeline\u2019s construction in northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cI'm angry that the DNR has signed off on a half-baked plan that spells disaster for our homeland and our way of life,\u201d Bad River Chairman Robert Blanchard said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue sounding the alarm to prevent yet another Enbridge pipeline from endangering our watershed.\u201d",
      "Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters) of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario. About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the pipeline run across the Bad River reservation.",
      "The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the pipeline from the reservation, arguing the 71-year-old line is prone to a catastrophic spill and land easements allowing Enbridge to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation's southern border.",
      "The company has only about two years to complete the project. U.S. District Judge William Conley last year ordered Enbridge to shut down the portion of pipeline crossing the reservation within three years and pay the tribe more than $5 million for trespassing. An Enbridge appeal is pending in a federal appellate court in Chicago.",
      "Michigan\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in a federal appellate court.",
      "Michigan regulators in December approved the company\u2019s $500 million plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."

      "Police had earlier indicated that information received from those who recently helped bring three miners to the surface indicated that up to 4,000 miners may be underground.",
      "However, on Thursday afternoon, police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said that they believed the number was exaggerated and maybe be far less than that, estimating a figure of between 350 and 400 miners.",

      "Illegal mining remains common in South Africa's old gold-mining areas, with miners going into closed shafts to dig for any possible remaining deposits.",
      "The illegal miners are often from neighboring countries, and police say the illegal operations involve larger syndicates that employ the miners.",
      "Their presence in closed mines have also created problems with nearby communities, which complain that the illegal miners commit crimes ranging from robberies to rape.",
      "Illegal mining groups are known to be heavily armed, and disputes between rival groups sometimes result in fatal confrontations."

      "Ford Motor Co. will pay a penalty of up to $165 million to the U.S. government for moving too slowly on a recall and failing to give accurate recall information",
      "DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. will pay a penalty of up to $165 million to the U.S. government for moving too slowly on a recall and failing to give accurate recall information.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday that the civil penalty is the second-largest in its 54-year history. Only the fine Takata paid for faulty air bag inflators was higher.",
      "The agency said Ford was too slow to recall vehicles with faulty rearview cameras, and it failed to give the agency complete information, which is required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Ford agreed to a consent order with the agency that includes a payment of $65 million, and $45 million in spending to comply with the law. Another $55 million will be deferred.",
      "\u201cTimely and accurate recalls are critical to keeping everyone safe on our roads,\u201d NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said. \u201cWhen manufacturers fail to prioritize the safety of the American public and meet their obligations under federal law, NHTSA will hold them accountable.\u201d",
      "Under the order, an independent third party will oversee the automaker\u2019s recall performance obligations for at least three years, and Ford has to cooperate with the monitor.",
      "Ford also has to review all recalls over the last three years to make sure enough vehicles have been recalled, and file new recalls if necessary.",
      "The company also must review and change its recall decision-making process, improving the way it analyzes data to find safety defects in its vehicles. It also has to invest in technology so it can trace parts by vehicle identification numbers.",
      "Ford says it will invest the $45 million into advanced data analytics, a new document system, and a new testing lab.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to resolve this matter with NHTSA and remain committed to continuously improving safety,\u201d Ford said in a statement.",
      "Under the law, an automaker has to notify NHTSA by filing a defect report within five working days of finding out that a line of vehicles has a safety defect.",
      "The problematic recall of more than 620,000 vehicles in the U.S., over 700,000 in North America, came in September of 2020 for rear-view cameras that can fail on several 2020 models, including the F-Series pickup, the top selling vehicle in the U.S.",
      "In agency documents, NHTSA said Ford found warranty claims about the faulty cameras from February through April of 2020, and the matter was brought to a Ford committee in May of that year.",
      "In July of 2020, NHTSA contacted Ford about complaints it had received about failing cameras, and during an August 2020, meeting with NHTSA, Ford showed data for many 2020 models with high camera failure rates.",
      "The company did the recall on Sept. 23, 2020, and about a year later NHTSA began investigating whether the recall was done quickly enough or included enough vehicles.",
      "In 2022 and 2024, Ford did two more recalls for the same problem, adding about 24,000 vehicles to the first camera recall.",
      "In the consent order, NHTSA said its investigation found that Ford violated multiple parts of the law by moving too slowly to recall vehicles with faulty cameras, giving the agency inaccurate or incomplete information, and failing to turn in required quarterly reports about additional recalls.",
      "The order said that Ford disagreed with its assertions.",
      "For several years, high warranty and recall costs have dinged Ford's profits, but the company says it's working to fix the issues.",
      "The penalty doesn\u2019t end conflicts between Ford and NHTSA.",
      "Earlier this year the agency opened an investigation into a Ford SUV recall repair that doesn\u2019t fix gasoline leaks that can cause engine fires. Investigators wrote in an April 25 letter to Ford that they have \u201csignificant safety concerns\u201d about a March 8 recall of nearly 43,000 Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs.",
      "Ford said in documents that fuel injectors can crack, allowing gas or vapor to leak near hot engine parts, potentially causing fires and injuries. But the fix is to add a drain tube to send the gas away from hot surfaces and software that cuts off the fuel supply if it detects a leak.",
      "In the letter, the agency\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation wrote that based on its review of the recall fix, it \u201cbelieves that the remedy program does not address the root cause of the issue and does not proactively call for the replacement of defective fuel injectors prior to their failure.\u201d",
      "Ford said that it has a strong recall process and is committed to complying with the law, but it can always improve. It said it has learned from the camera recall.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to working with NHTSA and the independent third party to implement further enhancements,\u201d Ford said.",

      "Jon Jones and Stipe Miocic are set to fight for the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden",
      "NEW YORK -- Stipe Miocic chewed on his place in UFC history as he picked at a plate of food in between \u2014 and even during \u2014 questions ahead of his heavyweight clash with champion Jon Jones that should satiate the palate of most fight fans.",
      "After a year delay, and MMA pundits would argue this fight should have gone down much earlier than Saturday night, Miocic gets his shot at a third heavyweight championship reign when he fights Jones at UFC 309.",
      "Win or lose, Miocic isn\u2019t thinking retirement just yet.",
      "Oh, as a fighter? Sure, the prospect of the 42-year-old Miocic hanging up the gloves after his fight at Madison Square Garden looms as a talking point ahead of the showdown with Jones.",
      "As a firefighter and paramedic in Ohio, Miocic isn\u2019t ready to retire his hose.",
      "\u201cOh, that\u2019s a long time away,\" Miocic said.",
      "Almost as long as Miocic (20-4) has had to train \u2014 and stew for more than three years since his last fight \u2014 for his shot at Jones.",
      "The heavyweights were slated to fight last November at the Garden until Jones, widely considered the greatest fighter in the world, tore a tendon during training and was forced to withdraw. UFC President Dana White deemed an interim championship fight was beneath a fighter of Miocic\u2019s stature.",
      "\u201cOf course,\u201d Miocic said, \u201cI wanted Jon Jones more than anything.\u201d",
      "Miocic would join MMA great Randy Couture as the only UFC fighters with three title reigns in one division. Miocic beat Fabricio Werdum and UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier to win his previous two heavyweight championships.",
      "A win against Jones might top the exhilaration of the previous title wins.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all special,\u201d Miocic said. \"But maybe this one, I think, because it\u2019s the Mecca; it\u2019s Jon Jones. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that. Or bigger.\u201d",
      "Cormier knows the feeling about as well as any fighter of the thirst to fight Jones. Cormier, who now calls fights for ESPN, is also forever connected to Miocic thanks to their epic UFC trilogy. Cormier also fought Jones (27-1-0; 1 NC) twice.",
      "Cormier lost to Jones at light heavyweight in 2015 and again in 2017, though the latter was overturned to a no-contest after Jones tested positive for the steroid Turinabo. He beat Miocic for the heavyweight crown with a first-round knockout in 2018, then lost consecutive fights to him in 2019 and 2020 before he retired.",
      "Cormier wanted to stay neutral because of his commentary role and declined to pick a winner. A former UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight champion, Cormier did break down the fight for The Associated Press.",
      "Jones is a 15-1 favorite, per BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "\u201cJones\u2019 best weapons are that he\u2019s so diverse, man. And he\u2019s tough,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cYou can hit him with some really big shots, hard shots, and he just doesn\u2019t get deterred. He\u2019s very tough, diverse weapons, well-rounded, great cardio, fight IQ is really high.\u201d",
      "Jones reclaimed his UFC light heavyweight title in July 2017 by stopping Cormier in the third round with a vicious head kick and a finish on the ground at UFC 214.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t even touch Jones,\u201d Cormier said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m like, diving at him, throwing lunging punches and he\u2019s kneeing me the whole time.\u201d",
      "Cormier abruptly flattened Miocic in July 2018 with a right elbow out of a clinch in the first round of their first fight and was crowned heavyweight champion.",
      "\"He\u2019s got a championship mind,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe can adjust on the fly, which is very important.\u201d",
      "Cormier lost the title back to Miocic in 2019 and was defeated via unanimous decision in the final fight of his career a year later.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very fast for a big guy,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be faster than Jones this weekend in terms of hand speed. He\u2019s freaking strong, man. Like, physically just strong. When he grabs you, it\u2019s very difficult to get away from that dude.\u201d",
      "Both fighters are 6-foot-4, though an 84-inch reach could actually hinder Jones if they go deep into the five-round bout.",
      "\u201cWhen he\u2019s in close, he\u2019s not as good,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cWhen you get inside of his range, he\u2019s not as good because his arms are so long. He\u2019s almost limited to kneeing and trying to elbow. If you\u2019re a guy that\u2019s good in the clinch, you can get some punches off on him.\u201d",
      "Both fighters have had little to do but train over the last five years.",
      "Jones hasn\u2019t fought since he ended a three-year sabbatical and choked out Ciryl Gane at UFC 285 in March 2023. Miocic last fought when he dropped the belt to Francis Ngannou at UFC 280 in March 2021.",
      "Cormier compared Miocic to retired New England Patriots QB Tom Brady in the sense that they were both athletes who thrived \u2014 and took hard hits \u2014 from their late 30s and into their 40s.",
      "\u201cStipe Miocic is tasked with going out there for 25 minutes and doing something he\u2019s done his entire adulthood,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe\u2019s big now. He\u2019s 250! He\u2019s huge. He doesn\u2019t even look like the same guy I fought. When I fought him he was 230 because he wanted to be faster because I was fast. Jon\u2019s not as fast with his hands. But if you stay in range, Jon will kick you, and he will kick you a lot and hard.\u201d",
      "Both fighters have teased retirement, though a fight with interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall looms for the winner.",
      "No matter the outcome, Miocic said he was reporting back to duty later in the week with his Ohio fire department. Jones' legacy as one of the great mixed martial arts fighters of all time is secure.",
      "\u201cI think for Stipe it will be tough to continue,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cIf the sport wants Jon Jones around, Stipe needs to win. I think there\u2019s a better chance Jones fights again soon if he loses. If he wins, he has nothing to prove. He\u2019s done everything.\u201d",

      "Judge Christopher Lopez gave the go ahead during a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston that lasted 90 minutes.",
      "\u201cThis case was no layup, not for anyone. A lot of hard work went into this,\" Lopez said during the hearing.",
      "Diamond Sports had been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of Texas since it filed for protection in March 2023. The company said in a financial filing last year that it had debt of $8.67 billion.",
      "Diamond will emerge out of bankruptcy with significantly less debt \u2014 around $200 million \u2014 but also with fewer teams and networks.",
      "When Diamond entered bankruptcy, it owned 19 networks under the Bally Sports banner and had the rights to 42 professional teams (14 baseball, 16 NBA and 12 NHL).",
      "The reorganized company now operates under the FanDuel Sports Network banner after agreeing to a naming rights deal last month. It has 16 networks and carries games for 27 franchises (six baseball, 13 NBA and eight NHL).",
      "The 16 networks cover fans in 31 states. The company expects to complete the restructuring process in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cToday is a landmark day for Diamond, as we embark on a new path for our business. Diamond is now unencumbered by legacy debt, financially stable and enthusiastically supported by new ownership,\" Diamond CEO David Preschlack said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead, Diamond is well-positioned to further enhance its product offering and remains committed to delivering the highest quality live sports content in-market to fans through both linear and direct-to-consumer frameworks.\"",
      "Last month as part of the reorganization plan, Diamond voided the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays while attempting to rework the deals of the five franchises that had partial ownership of their regional sports networks.",
      "Diamond has revised deals with the Tigers and Rays, as well as reaching agreements with the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels and Miami Marlins, which include streaming rights. Talks are continuing with the Kansas City Royals.",
      "The Cincinnati Reds and Diamond have ended their joint venture, but a lawyer for Diamond said during Thursday's hearing that they would be open to resuming discussions. Shortly after the hearing, Major League Baseball announced it will produce and distribute Reds games next season.",
      "Cincinnati had a 20% stake in their RSN affiliate. Diamond bought back the Reds\u2019 stake for $1.",
      "Atlanta was the only franchise whose contract would have been unchanged, but the Braves have agreed to an amended deal, which include streaming rights.",
      "Steaming is an important avenue for Diamond as it seeks to find new audiences. The company announced on Wednesday it reached a multiyear agreement with Prime Video to make its channels available as an add-on subscription.",
      "Prime Video announced earlier this year that it would buy a minority stake in Diamond Sports.",
      "Diamond will also offer single-game pricing on its direct-to-consumer app for NBA and NHL games beginning Dec. 5.",
      "Viewers will have the option for single games at $6.99, as well as the chance to sign up for monthly or season pass subscriptions.",
      "Diamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.",

      "Instead, Rioux will spend the 2024-25 season practicing with teammates and honing his skills \u2014 and still be a freshman next fall.",
      "\u201cI should have made that clear (before),\" Golden said. \"Honestly, it\u2019s put him in a tough situation. He\u2019s sitting over there at the end of games and everybody\u2019s yelling at him and trying to get him out there. They just hadn\u2019t understood that that was our potential plan for him.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s where we\u2019re at at this moment. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s 100% going to be the plan. We\u2019ll continue to talk to him and see if he changes what he wants to do. But as of right now, that\u2019s the plan that we\u2019re going to have with him as we move forward.\u201d",
      "Florida students chanted for \u201cOli\u201d in both of the team's home games this season. Golden emptied the bench in the final minutes of an 86-62 victory over Grambling State on Monday night and even said a few words to Rioux during the chaotic scene.",
      "\u201cI was just explaining to him, \u2019Hey, the reason why I\u2019m not putting you in right now is what we\u2019ve talked about a little bit,'\u201d Golden said. \"This wasn\u2019t a choice that I made for him. This is something that people (from) our program have talked with him and his family and his parents, his AAU coach and just kind of trying to figure out what the best route for him is.",
      "\u201cI just went up to him and I was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not trying to be disrespectful with you. I\u2019m just not trying to burn your year putting you in for 30 seconds.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rioux handled the decision well, Golden said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid, and he\u2019s a pleaser,\u201d Golden said. \"He wants to do what others think is best for him. And he\u2019s coachable. Again, if this is what our staff, his parents, the people around him that care about him, think is best, I think he\u2019s going to be comfortable. Ultimately, it\u2019s his decision. But I think that\u2019s where he\u2019ll land.\u201d",

      "The 27-year-old Paul is relatively new to the sport, the one-time social media influencer bringing a 10-1 record with seven knockouts mostly against mixed martial artists and journeymen boxers.",
      "Asked about the friendship earlier in the week, Tyson said, \u201cThere's no feeling attached.\u201d He proved it by slapping Paul as they faced off following the weigh-in Thursday night.",

It\u2019s like Ja Morant turning down a 1-v-1 against LeBron. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",

He didn\u2019t make this road trip and it\u2019s unclear when he\u2019ll make his season debut.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m impressed, even though we\u2019re much more talented than Wagner,\u201d said Pitino, the Hall of Fame coach in his second season with the Red Storm. \u201cThey turned up the heat and made shots, and they were very poised when it counted.\u201d",
      "St. John's (3-0) jumped into the AP Top 25 poll this week for the first time since January 2019. It earned its first win as a ranked squad since topping Tulane on Dec. 28, 2014.",
      "And for Pitino, it was his first game coaching a Top 25 team since 2017 at Louisville.",
      "He didn't think his players thought much about any of that, though.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice for the fans. Certainly we\u2019re proud of that,\" Pitino said. \"We need to get the subway alumni back. We\u2019ve got great fans, but we don\u2019t have a lot of them.",
      "\u201cIn New York, there\u2019s a lot to do, so there\u2019s only one way to get fans and that\u2019s to win.\"",

They\u2019ve got a great guard, they\u2019ve got great support players, they\u2019ve got a terrific inside player. This is a tough, tough test.\"",

      "\u201cWe contested almost every shot. I think we\u2019re ready defensively,\" Pitino said. \u201cI think offensively we\u2019ve just got to get a feel for each other a little bit more.\"",
      "Playing before a crowd of 4,751 at Carnesecca Arena on its Queens campus, St. John\u2019s led just 39-37 before Kadary Richmond blocked a shot and fed Smith for a transition 3 with 9:54 remaining.",
      "\u201cThat was a big play,\" Pitino said. \"I think the shooting at the end when the game was in question was magnificent. The defense was great the whole night, basically.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen (the lead) was three tonight, there was no panic. They took the shots that were there, so I have confidence in them,\" he added. \"But we\u2019re going to have to play great to beat New Mexico. We\u2019re going to have to play great to beat Baylor. We know that.\u201d",

      "___",
      "Teams considering a coaching change should be encouraged by some of the quick turnarounds around the NFL.",
      "Three teams with new coaches entered Week 11 holding a playoff position. Dan Quinn\u2019s Washington Commanders (7-4) led that group in victories despite a 26-18 loss to Philadelphia on Thursday night.",
      "Raheem Morris and the Atlanta Falcons (6-4) are first in the NFC South. Jim Harbaugh and the Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) currently have the second wild-card spot in the AFC.",
      "Quinn, Morris and Harbaugh have another thing in common. They previously were head coaches in the NFL. Harbaugh led the San Francisco 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance before going to Michigan and winning a national title last season.",
      "Quinn was Atlanta\u2019s coach when the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. Morris led Tampa Bay to one 10-win season in three years with the team more than a decade ago and also served as an interim coach for the Falcons in 2020.",
      "The four other first-year coaches \u2014 Seattle\u2019s Mike Macdonald (4-5), Tennessee\u2019s Brian Callahan (2-7), New England\u2019s Jerod Mayo (3-7) and Las Vegas\u2019 Antonio Pierce (2-7) are 11-26 combined. Macdonald, Callahan and Mayo are head coaches for the first time. Pierce went 5-4 as an interim coach with the Raiders last year.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise rookie coaches are having fast success. At least one NFL team with a new coach has reached the playoffs every year since the 2006 season.",
      "Last year, it was DeMeco Ryans guiding Houston to an AFC South title and a playoff victory. In 2022, a record five first-year coaches led their teams to the postseason.",
      "Quinn took over a team that hadn\u2019t had a winning record since 2016. But the Commanders had the No. 2 pick in the draft and nailed it with quarterback Jayden Daniels, a leading candidate for AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.",
      "Washington also added several starters in free agency, including linebackers Bobby Wagner, Frankie Luvu and Dante Fowler Jr., center Tyler Biadasz, left guard Nick Allegretti, tight end Zach Ertz, edge rusher Clelin Ferrell and safety Jeremy Chinn. They also signed running back Austin Ekeler, drafted wide receiver Luke McCaffrey and just traded for Pro Bowl cornerback Marshon Lattimore.",
      "The Commanders still have a chance to win the NFC East even after losing to the Eagles (8-2). Washington has a softer schedule the rest of the way. After a bye, the Commanders play the Cowboys, Titans and Saints. Then they face the Eagles and Dallas sandwiched around a matchup with Atlanta.",
      "Morris inherited a team that last had a winning record in 2017. The Falcons signed Kirk Cousins to a massive contract to solve their quarterback dilemma. They added receiver Darnell Mooney and Pro Bowl safety Justin Simmons in free agency and acquired pass rusher Matthew Judon in a trade.",
      "With two wins over Tampa Bay (4-6), Atlanta essentially has a three-game edge over the three-time defending division champion Buccaneers.",
      "Harbaugh walked into the most favorable situation in Los Angeles. The Chargers already had franchise QB Justin Herbert and were a playoff team in 2022. They signed running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards to strengthen their rushing attack and balance the offense. Los Angeles drafted right tackle Joe Alt with the No. 5 overall pick and selected wide receiver Ladd McConkey in the second round to help replace Keenan Allen and Mike Williams.",
      "The Chargers have a tough schedule the rest of the way, starting with a home game against the Bengals this week. Then it\u2019s the Ravens, Falcons, Chiefs, Buccaneers and Broncos before finishing up against the Patriots and Raiders.",
      "Harbaugh\u2019s team will have to earn that playoff berth.",
      "The Jets and Saints already fired their coaches so they\u2019ll be looking for a new leader. A few more teams will be in the market.",
      "It doesn\u2019t have to take years to rebuild.",

      "IRVING, Texas -- Mike Tyson wasn\u2019t in the mood for talking in the final news conference before the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion faces YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul.",
      "Tyson had terse answers for all the questions Wednesday night, two nights before the fight against Paul, who is 31 years younger, at the home of the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys.",
      "The issue of Tyson\u2019s health didn\u2019t come up in a small concert venue about 20 miles from AT&T Stadium. A bout originally scheduled for July 20 was postponed to Friday night after Tyson had to be treated for a stomach ulcer when he fell ill on a flight.",
      "Tyson said in a documentary promoting the fight that he lost 26 pounds while recovering, but Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder with Paul of Most Valuable Promotions, said Tyson had been cleared medically for weeks.",
      "Bidarian also said Tyson was going through the same regular medical checkups of any sanctioned pro fight in Texas.",
      "Several states wouldn\u2019t sanction the bout. Texas agreed to a fight that was eight rounds instead of 10 or 12, with two-minute rounds instead of three, and heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said everything I had to say,\u201d Tyson said in one of several attempts to get him to say more. \u201cI\u2019m just looking forward to fighting.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cute,\u201d Paul said of the terse Tyson. \u201cI fear no man, so I want him to be that old savage Mike.\u201d",
      "Paul couldn't even get Tyson to respond by wearing what the 27-year-old said was a \u201cdiamond-spiked ear cover.\u201d It was Paul's jab at Tyson over the Hall of Famer infamously biting the ear of Evander Holyfield in a 1997 fight.",
      "Tyson did get briefly riled up when somebody asked twice what he would do if he lost. His last sanctioned bout was in 2005. Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition four years ago.",
      "\u201cI am not going to lose,\u201d Tyson said, his voice rising the second time it was asked. \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d",
      "Tyson was 50-6 with 44 knockouts before retiring 19 years ago. Paul is 10-1 with seven knockouts in less than five years as a pro, facing mostly mixed martial artists and journeymen boxers.",
      "The fight is the first combat sports event to be streamed on Netflix. It will be available at no additional cost to the more than 280 million Netflix subscribers globally.",
      "Paul is a minus-200 betting favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. That means the payout for a Paul victory would be about half the amount of any bet.",
      "The co-main event is a rematch between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano for the undisputed super welterweight title.",
      "Taylor won a split decision that many questioned in a slugfest at sold-out Madison Square Garden in 2022 in the first women's fight to headline at the famous venue.",
      "Taylor and Serrano sat behind Tyson and Paul on the stage, with the 10 fighters from the undercards on either side of Tyson and Paul.",

    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",

      "For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven\u2019t lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",
      "Argentina withdrew from the climate talks on Wednesday on the orders of its president, climate skeptic Javier Milei. The Argentine government did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Climate activists called the decision regrettable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand how a climate-vulnerable country like Argentina would cut itself from critical support,\" said Anabella Rosemberg, an Argentina native who works as a senior adviser at Climate Action Network International.",
      "Also Wednesday, France's environment minister, who was set to lead the delegation, pulled out of the talks after Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev called out France and the Netherlands for their colonial histories.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher called Aliyev\u2019s remarks on France and Europe \u201cunacceptable.\" Speaking at the French Senate on Wednesday, Pannier-Runacher criticized Azerbaijan\u2019s leader for using the fight against climate change \u201cfor a shameful personal agenda.\u201d",

      "Removing certain items, earnings were $1.14 per share. This topped the $1.09 per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were looking for.",
      "Shares jumped more than 9% before the market open on Thursday.",
      "Revenue climbed 6% to $22.57 billion, but fell a bit short of Wall Street's estimate of $22.59 billion.",
      "Operating income for the entertainment segment, which includes its movie studio and parts of its television wing, more than quadrupled to $1.07 billion.",

      "The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $253 million compared with an operating loss of $420 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion.",
      "The combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",

      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",

      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",

      "\u201cThe Digital Duty of Care will place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms,\u201d Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement.",
      "The proposed changes to the Online Safety Act were announced before the government next week introduces to Parliament world-first legislation that would ban children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.",
      "Critics have argued that removing children from social media reduced incentives for platforms to provide safer online environments.",
      "Social media has been blamed for an increase in children taking their own lives and developing eating disorders due to bulling and exposures to negative body images.",
      "Rowland said making tech companies legally responsible for keeping Australians safe was an approach already adopted by Britain and the European Union.",
      "Digital businesses would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harms on their platforms and services. The duty of care framework would be underpinned by risk assessment and risk mitigation, and informed by safety-by-design principles, the minister said.",
      "Legislating a duty of care would mean services can\u2019t \u201cset and forget.\u201d Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said.",

      "\u201cWith respect to the government and prime minister, they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age, they\u2019re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people\u2019s daily lives,\u201d Leo said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of their communities, it\u2019s part of work, it\u2019s part of entertainment, it\u2019s where they watch content \u2013 young people aren\u2019t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV \u2013 and so it can\u2019t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",
      "Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination bid credits his platform with \u201cfostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.\u201d",
      "One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children.",
      "Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator.",
      "\u201cKids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they\u2019re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there\u2019s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don\u2019t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,\u201d Sonya Ryan said.",
      "\u201cThe result of that is we\u2019re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we\u2019re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,\u201d she added.",
      "Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia.",
      "She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get this perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.\"",
      "A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation\u2019s potential privacy implications.",
      "Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16.",
      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users\u2019 identification data instead.",
      "The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit.",
      "\u201cThe worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThey would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,\u201d he added.",
      "The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented.",
      "Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost if we don\u2019t? If we don\u2019t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?\u201d she asked.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children.",
      "Analysts say Ukraine is among the countries that are the most affected by landmines and discarded explosives, as a result of Russia\u2019s ongoing war.",
      "According to U.N. figures, some 399 people have been killed and 915 wounded from landmines and other munitions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, equal to the number of casualties reported from 2014-2021. More than 1 in 10 of those casualties have been children.",
      "The economic impact is costing billions to the Ukrainian economy. Landmines and other munitions are preventing the sowing of 5 million hectares, or 10%, of the country\u2019s agricultural land.",
      "Cyprus stepped up to offer its facilities as part of the European Union\u2019s Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine. So far, almost 100 Ukrainian armed forces personnel have taken part in three training cycles over the last two years, said Cyprus Foreign Ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to continuing this support for as long as it takes,\u201d Gotsis told the Associated Press, adding that the Cyprus government has covered the 250,000 euro ($262,600) training cost.",
      "Cyprus opted to offer such training owing to its own landmine issues dating back five decades when the island nation was ethnically divided when Turkey invaded following a coup that sought union with Greece. The United Nations has removed some 27,000 landmines from a buffer zone that cuts across the island, but minefields remain on either side. The Cypriot government says it has disposed of all anti-personnel mines in line with its obligations under an international treaty that bans the use of such munitions.",
      "In Cyprus, Ukrainians undergo rigorous theoretical and practical training over a five-week Basic Demining and Clearance course that includes instruction on distinguishing and safely handling landmines and other explosive munitions, such as rockets, 155 mm artillery shells, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells.",
      "Theoretical training uses inert munitions identical to the actual explosives.",
      "Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat will be the trainees\u2019 primary task when they return.\u201d",
      "Cypriot officials said the Ukrainian trainees did not want to be either interviewed or photographed.",
      "Defusing discarded munitions or landmines in areas where explosive charges can\u2019t be used \u2014 for instance, near a hospital \u2014 is not part of this course because that\u2019s the task of highly trained teams of disposal experts whose training can last as long as eight months, the officer said.",
      "Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders \u2014 long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground\u2019s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "Another tool is a feeler, a rod that\u2019s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate.",
      "\u201cBooby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,\u201d the chief training officer explained.",
      "Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols.",
      "The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused.",
      "\u201cYou see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they\u2019ve made and the correct way of doing it,\u201d the officer said.",
      "Humanitarian data and analysis group ACAPS said in a Jan. 2024 report that 174,000 sq. kilometers (67,182 sq. miles) or nearly 29% of Ukraine\u2019s territory needs to be surveyed for landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "More than 10 million people are said to live in areas where demining action is needed.",
      "Since 2022, Russian forces have used at least 13 types of anti-personnel mines, which target people. Russia never signed the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel mines, but the use of such mines is nonetheless considered a violation of its obligations under international law.",
      "Russia also uses 13 types of anti-tank mines.",
      "The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in its 2023 Landmine Monitor report that Ukrainian government forces may have also used antipersonnel landmines in contravention of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when the city was under Russian control."

      "European Union regulators hit Facebook parent Meta with a fine of nearly 800 million euros on Thursday for what it calls \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.",
      "It\u2019s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc\u2019s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties.",
      "The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace \u201cwhether they want it or not\" and shutting out competitors.",
      "It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data \u2014 generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram \u2014 to benefit Marketplace.",
      "Meta's practices gave it \u201cadvantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release \u201cThis is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d",
      "Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d to rivals or consumers and \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.\u201d",
      "The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to \u201dengage with Marketplace, and many don't.\" It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow.",
      "Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal.",
      "The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions.",
      "The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU\u2019s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.",

      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",

      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",

      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",

      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",

      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",

      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",

      "The expansion comes eight months after Waymo began offering rides in Los Angeles to a limited group of passengers chosen from a waiting list that had ballooned to more than 300,000 people. Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",

      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",

      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee had said sealed bids would be opened at 10:30 a.m. CST so the winning bidder or bidders could be chosen. But Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the results.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "He later wrote on the social media platform X that the trustees told him the results will be released Thursday morning.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",

      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",

      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "Only 11 of the 43 Rhesus macaques that escaped last week now remain outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, police said in a statement.",
      "Alpha Genesis officials told police that the two monkeys captured Tuesday were eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and appeared to be in good health.",
      "A group of monkeys remains outside the fence close to traps set up by the company in the woods around the compound. They can be heard cooing by the Alpha Genesis employees monitoring them, police said.",
      "In all, 32 monkeys have been returned to the compound since their escape on Nov. 6 after an employee didn't fully lock an enclosure.",
      "Alpha Genesis has said that efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription",
      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 09:48:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The woman at the center of the DOJ's probe of Matt Gaetz testified to the House Ethics Committee that he had sex with her when she was 17 years old, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Trump tapped Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be the new attorney general.",
      "The woman who was at the center of a yearslong Justice Department investigation into sex trafficking allegations surrounding Rep. Matt Gaetz testified to the House Ethics Committee that the now-former Florida congressman had sex with her when she was 17 years old, sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that Gaetz had been tapped to serve as attorney general, overseeing the very branch of government that previously conducted its own investigation of him, which ended last year without charges being brought.",
      "Gaetz resigned from office following Trump's announcement. This came as the House Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its investigation, said sources, who added that the committee was preparing to meet this week to deliberate over whether to release a final report on the matter.",
      "Over the summer, the House Ethics Committee subpoenaed the woman at the center of the probe -- who is now in her 20s -- and she sat for multiple days of testimony where she testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her when she was a minor in high school, sources close to the investigation said.",
      "\"These allegations are invented and would constitute false testimony to Congress,\" Gaetz said in response to ABC News' reporting. \"This false smear following a three-year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism.\"",
      "The Justice Department spent years probing the allegations against Gaetz, including allegations of obstruction of justice, before informing Gaetz last year that it would not bring charges.",
      "Gaetz has long denied any wrongdoing related to the Justice Department probe. In September, he released a detailed response to questions sent to him by the House Ethics Committee, which has been investigating allegations of alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, reiterating his denial of the allegations.",
      "\"Your correspondence of September 4 asks whether I have engaged in sexual activity with any individual under 18. The answer to this question is unequivocally NO. You can apply this response to every version of this question, in every forum,\" Gaetz said in a statement posted to his social media account.",
      "\"The Committee\u2019s star witness, Joel Greenberg, is a felonious liar who involves others in his lies ... Greenberg was initially indicted for attempting to falsely smear a teacher at a local high school as a pedophile,\" Gaetz added regarding former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, who pleaded guilty to falsely accusing a teacher, who was running for office against him, of a sex crime.",
      "The woman's allegation regarding Gaetz became part of the investigation following claims by Greenberg, a former friend of Gaetz who is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after reaching a deal with investigators in May 2021 in which he pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes, including sex trafficking of the woman when she was a minor and introducing her to other \"adult men\" who also had sex with her when she was underage.",
      "According to Greenberg's plea deal, the woman, who ABC News is not identifying, met Greenberg online in 2017 and began meeting him in hotels and houses in the Middle District of Florida, where he \"introduced the Minor to other adult men, who engaged in commercial sex acts with the Minor in the Middle District of Florida,\" court documents said.",
      "At the time, the minor \"represented that she was an adult\" on the website where she met Greenberg -- and according to his plea agreement, he acknowledges that he \"acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the Minor was less than 18 years old when he engaged in commercial sex acts\" and had a \"reasonable opportunity to observe\" that she was underage.",
      "Over the course of its investigation, the House Ethics Committee conducted interviews with at least half a dozen women who allegedly attended parties where the Florida congressman was also present, and who were paid by Greenberg, Gaetz's one-time close friend, sources told ABC News. Some of the witnesses had been subpoenaed by the committee, while others agreed to cooperate, according to the sources.",
      "The House Ethics Committee also subpoenaed Gaetz's former girlfriend for testimony, and said she sat for an interview earlier in the year, sources said. The former girlfriend previously testified to a grand jury in the sex trafficking probe, as ABC News previously reported.",
      "The committee has also obtained a sworn written statement by Gaetz\u2019s ex-girlfriend where she lists the Florida congressman as one of the attendees at a party in July 2017 where drugs were present and which was attended by the woman who Gaetz allegedly had sex with when she was a minor, sources said.",
      "ABC News previously reported that the committee obtained written testimony from a separate woman who said that in July 2017, when she was 20 years old, she attended a party in Florida that Gaetz also attended, and which was attended by the woman who was a minor at the time and where drugs including cocaine were present.",
      "Greenberg, a key witness in the Justice Department probe, has been cooperating with the House Ethics investigation, according to sources. Earlier this year, while serving time in a Florida federal prison, he provided written testimony to the committee, the sources said.",
      "Some witnesses were shown Venmo payments they allegedly received from Gaetz, sources said.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, one woman who said she attended a party with the Gaetz in 2017, who ABC News is not identifying, told the committee that a payment from Gaetz was for sex, multiple sources told ABC News. Others have said they were paid to attend parties they said Gaetz also attended, and that those parties included drugs and sex, the sources said.",
      "Gaetz has long denied all of the allegations, including paying for sex, and previously dismissed them by claiming \"someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "Earlier in the year the committee subpoenaed the Justice Department for records related to its probe into the Florida congressman, sources said. It is unclear if those records were turned over.",
      "However, the committee had obtained some Venmo records from Gaetz after issuing the company a subpoena, sources told ABC News. During the Justice Department's investigation into Gaetz, public reporting, including by The Daily Beast, largely focused on Venmo records from Greenberg, who, according to his plea agreement, used his account to \"pay for commercial sex acts\" with women he also introduced to others.",

The bill notes that it is not intended to prevent schools from building single-occupancy facilities and does not ban someone of the opposite gender from entering to help another person.",
      "The Republican-backed bill passed 60-31 in the House and passed on party lines in the Senate, 24-7.",
      "Supporters say their concerns lie in student's privacy and protection.",
      "\"It protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable. It is us using our legislative authority to ensure schools are, in fact, safe environments. After all, bathrooms, showers, changing rooms should all be safe places for our students,\" said Republican state Sen. Jerry C. Cirino ahead of the bill's passage.",
      "Critics of the bill say that the bill is creating unfounded concerns about transgender students and may instead put trans students in danger of discrimination or violence.",

Antonio in an online statement \"There are so many other issues we should be working on. There should be no exception to liberty and justice for all, yet here we are telling our children that there are people who are less than. This bill is not about bathrooms. It's about demonizing those who are different, and our children are watching and listening to the fearmongering.\"",

      "\"These are gut-wrenching decisions that should be made by the parents and should be informed by teams of doctors who are advising them,\" said DeWine, adding that he did not find any families or hospitals who were seeking or allowing surgeries for youth. \"These are parents who have watched the child suffer sometimes for years and have real concerns that their child may not survive.\"",
      "DeWine's office declined ABC News' request for comment on the bill. He told reporters this past summer that he has to look at \"specific language\" in the legislation.",
      "\"I'm for people, kids, to be able to go to the bathroom with the gender assignment so that they have that protection, but I'll have to look at the specific language,\" DeWine  told reporters .",

Now his vice presidential responsibilities are taking shape, with expectations that he will be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in Congress, a source told ABC News.",
      "Leading up to the election, Vance kept a busy schedule that was a mix of campaign events and vast media appearances, including TV interviews, sitting down for digital interviews, and appearing on some of the world's most listened-to podcasts.",
      "During his election night speech, Trump called his running mate \"feisty\" and praised his work on the campaign trail.",
      "But as Vance enters his new role, a source familiar told ABC News that we should expect him to play a different role than the one we've become accustomed to over the past nearly four months.",
      "Vance has been tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and will work on any of the issues Trump needs him to further, a source familiar told ABC News, signaling that Vance will not be assigned one specific issue to work on, but will be involved in several policy issues.",
      "Some of the policy issues Vance could be dispatched on include the economy and immigration, which were the core issues Trump ran on during his campaign, the source said.",
      "It's also expected that Vance will be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in the Senate to ensure that his agenda moves forward, the source also said.",
      "It's familiar territory for Vance, who was elected to the Senate in 2022. When Vance is sworn in as vice president in January, he will be the youngest vice president in modern American history and will be entering the office with a very brief political portfolio, having just those two years in the Senate as the first political office he ever held.",

Still, Vance once made clear his disdain for Trump, saying he was a \"never-Trump guy\" in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2016.",

      "In June of this year, Vance spoke at a Turning Point event where he was asked what Trump needed in a vice president and Vance said someone who is \"not trying to stab him in the back.\"",

      "Across hours of podcast and television interviews, Army veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth has articulated his plan for a \"frontal assault\" to reform the Department of Defense from the top down, including by purging \"woke\" generals, limiting women from some combat roles, eliminating diversity goals and utilizing the \"real threat of violence\" to reassert the United States as a global power.",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, 44, could have the chance to implement that vision, commanding the country's more than a million active duty soldiers.",
      "An infantry officer in the U.S. Army National Guard, Hegseth deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan before leaving the service with the rank of major, according to military records. Hegseth has worked for Fox News since 2014, where he co-hosts \"FOX & Friends Weekend.\" Once a critic of Trump's foreign policy and military stances during Trump's 2016 campaign, Hegseth grew to become one of Trump's fiercest on-air defenders.",
      "\"Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\" Trump said announcing the nomination.",
      "A New York Times best-selling author, Hegseth has frequently commented on military policy and suggested one of his first orders of business would be firing any generals who supported the Pentagon's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.",
      "\"First of all, you got to fire the Chairman Joint of the Chiefs and obviously going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense, but any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in, any of the DEI woke s---, has got to go,\" Hegseth said during a recent interview on the \"Shawn Ryan Show\" podcast. \"Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about.\"",
      "Hegseth had preemptively defended the move, saying it would be a return to normalcy for soldiers rather than a \"MAGA takeover.\"",
      "While Hegseth has described countries like Russia and China as threats, he has framed the military's biggest threat as an internal one, arguing that \"wokeness\" divided the military internally and created an issue that adversaries can exploit.",
      "\"I think our biggest threat is internal. I think we're committing cultural suicide, and we've lost complete focus on the basics and building blocks of what made Western civilization in America exceptional, fruitful, prosperous, strong, free,\" Hegseth said on the podcast.",
      "Hegseth has proposed a wholesale purge of military officials who have supported DEI policies, urging a \"frontal assault right back at what's been done to this military from the top and to the bottom.\"",
      "\"The dumbest phrase on planet Earth in the military is our diversity is our strength,\" Hegseth said on the podcast, arguing that uniformity between soldiers is a key to the military's strength.",
      "\"Every time I hear a military leader say [diversity is our strength], I throw up in my mouth a little bit more, because if they believe it, it shows you how sideways and how indoctrinated they are,\" Hegseth said on \"The Right Take With Mark Tapson\" podcast.",
      "While 17.5% of active-duty military personnel are women, Hegseth has argued that military leaders should acknowledge that their main constituency is \"strong, normal men,\" rebuffing efforts to diversify the ranks of the armed services.",
      "\"There aren't enough lesbians in San Francisco to staff the 82nd Airborne like you need, you need the boys in Kentucky and Texas and North Carolina and Wisconsin,\" Hegseth said on Tapson's podcast earlier this year.",
      "Hegseth was on the \"Take It Outside with Jay Cutler and Sam Mackey\" podcast and said that transgender soldiers are \"not deployable\" because they are \"reliant on chemicals\" and suggested that women should not serve in certain combat roles.",
      "\"Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse,\" Hegseth said on Ryan's podcast, arguing that men are \"more capable\" in combat roles because of biological factors.",
      "An ardent defender of the president-elect, Hegseth has argued that the United States military under Trump was more effective by posing both \"uncertainty\" and the \"real threat of violence.\"",
      "\"At least under Trump, there were missiles falling on terrorists' heads,\" Hegseth said on the \"Man of War\" podcast with Rafa Conde. \"They knew he meant business. Kim Jong Un, even though it didn't work, knew Trump meant business. Fire and fury was a real thing. Uncertainty is a real thing. The real threat of violence is a real thing, and none of that exists under these globalists who think they can sanction their way.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:12:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's announcement that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency has alarmed some government ethics experts.",
    "story": [
      "Experts warn the pair's role could raise possible conflict concerns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's announcement Tuesday that tech billionaire Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a newly formed advisory Department of Government Efficiency has alarmed some government ethics experts, who say the pair's deep financial interests could lead to potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Some ethics experts are particularly alarmed that Musk and Ramaswamy's roles have been described as \"outside of government\" -- an arrangement that could potentially mean they would not be subject to normal financial disclosure rules, despite the major impact their work could have on the federal government.",
      "\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said of Musk and Ramaswamy, both of whom were vocal supporters of Trump's reelection campaign.",
      "As outside governmental advisers, Musk -- who owns Tesla, X and SpaceX -- and Ramaswamy -- who founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences -- might not be subject to federal requirements mandating that officials disclose their financial interests to the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Certain categories of advisers from outside the government can be required to disclose their interests under the Federal Advisory Committee Act -- including if they are classified as a \"Special Government Employee\" -- but ethics experts say that not enough is known about the proposed department to know if they would be covered under that act.",
      "Musk has promised transparency, posting on X shortly after the announcement, \"All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency.\"",
      "\"The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest,\" Trump transition spokesperson Brian Hughes told ABC News.",
      "Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, told ABC News that the possibility that Musk and Ramaswamy would not have financial disclosure obligations is alarming because their work cutting government regulations or spending could directly impact their business interests without the public knowing.",
      "\"It could be simply an attempt to stop the regulations on their business interest at the expense of government workers and the public,\" said Payne, who added that they could also be in a position to get more government contracts for their businesses.",
      "\"If you eliminate the government from doing certain tasks, then those tasks can go to government contracts for consultants,\" Payne said.",
      "Payne also stressed the highly unusual nature of Musk and Ramaswamy's proposed roles as outside advisers with significant influence.",
      "\"It's extremely rare to do it like this,\" he said. \"It is common to have outside experts give advice to the government ... where it might just be a meeting, or something that's over a period of time. But to have a situation where we have outside entrepreneurs with business interests, possibly changing how they are regulated, and having this much power, that's not common.\"",
      "Payne also said called for transparency regarding who else would be working with Musk and Ramaswamy in the new department, saying their interests would need to be made public as well.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington, echoed some of Payne's concerns about potential conflicts of interest given Musk and Ramaswamy's business interests, while emphasizing that more details are necessary to determine whether there would be any violation of federal ethics laws.",
      "\"We don't yet know enough about how these positions will operate to know whether there will, in fact, be conflicts of interest and what those conflicts will be,\" Bookbinder said. \"If Musk and Ramaswamy are in a position where they can influence governmental decisions and if some of those decisions could impact their businesses, then there could be a danger of illegal conflicts of interest. Other laws and rules could also be at issue today depending on what they do and how this 'Department' works.\"",
      "Bookbinder also floated the possibility that others in government could feel pressed to look favorably on Musk's interests given his significant influence over Trump, which sources tell ABC News has recently seen Musk offering input on Trump's staffing decisions and playing a significant role in shaping the future Trump administration.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has a vision for education that revolves around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201c wokeness \u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d",
      "The president-elect wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices. He wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he\u2019s won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.",
      "Trump\u2019s education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to \u201cany school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would \u201cnot give one penny\u201d to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.",
      "He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.",
      "Trump\u2019s opponents say his vision of America\u2019s schools is warped by politics \u2014 that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.",
      "\u201cIt's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda,\u201d said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. \u201cThere is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs.\u201d",
      "Trump's platform calls for \u201cmassive funding preferences\u201d for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programs and allow parents to elect school principals.",
      "Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the U.S. Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by \u201cradicals.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s public K-12 schools get about 14% of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.",
      "Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.",
      "Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights \u2014 the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.",
      "The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term. That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a Day One loss of funding,\u201d Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues.\u201d",
      "Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.",
      "To get colleges to shutter diversity programs \u2014 which Trump says amount to discrimination \u2014 he said he \u201cwill advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.",
      "Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.",
      "Universities hope their relationship with the administration won\u2019t be as antagonistic as Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests.",
      "\u201cEducation has been an easy target during the campaign season,\u201d said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. \u201cBut a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars \u2014 the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return \u201call education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are \u201cfree from political meddling.\u201d",
      "Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarizing issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.",
      "Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.",
      "\u201cTrump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn\u2019t run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to,\u201d Eden said.",
      "Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for \u201cpatriotic\u201d education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a \u201cchallenge to American principles\u201d alongside fascism.",
      "Adding to that effort, Trump is proposing a new credentialing body to certify teachers \u201cwho embrace patriotic values.\u201d",
      "Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.",
      "More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden\u2019s Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t detailed his plans for student loans, though he has called Biden\u2019s cancellation proposals illegal and unfair.",
      "Most of Biden\u2019s signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.",

      "Musk's unconventional entrance into Trump's inner circle included a place in the family photo on election night. One of his first ventures was co-founding PayPal during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, which quickly propelled him to stardom in Silicon Valley.",
      "\"He used to be this true genius and visionary, this technological wunderkind who could think of something that would lead us to a brighter future and take us there,\" Estes said.",
      "In 2002, he founded a private space exploration company, SpaceX. Two years later, his next project was Tesla, a little-known startup that grew into the most valuable car company in the world over two decades.",
      "Tesla and Musk's other companies, such as internet provider Starlink and SpaceX, were transformed into innovative powerhouses thanks to contracts and subsidies from the federal government.",
      "Musk defined himself as apolitical throughout the 2000s. That started to change as Musk became increasingly critical of the government and federal regulation.",
      "\"It's become clear, especially in the past two or three years, that he's taken a sharp turn to the right,\" Estes said. \"And now he's widely viewed as Trump's biggest supporter and a main character in the MAGA sphere.\"",
      "Since then, Musk has promoted conspiracy theories, reposted antisemitic messages, and spread misinformation, such as attempting to downplay the violence that occurred on Jan. 6 at the Capitol.",
      "He invested at least $175 million into his Super PAC, called \"America PAC,\" for the Trump campaign. The billionaire's influence on the Trump agenda is already becoming evident.",
      "Musk was present for at least two phone calls that Trump had with foreign leaders, including a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Starlink has been a critical provider of internet services in Ukraine.",

      "Trump, who boasts 14 million followers on TikTok, voiced opposition to the ban earlier this year. The policy, which orders TikTok to find a U.S. parent company or face a ban, is set to take effect on Jan. 19, a day before Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "An effort to eliminate the ban may present formidable political challenges and legal hurdles, experts told ABC News. The outcome could depend on support from an array of major institutions ranging from Congress and the Supreme Court to tech giants like Google and Oracle, they added.",

      "A repeal would require passage in both houses of Congress, landing the measure on Trump\u2019s desk for his signature.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way is to ask Congress to reverse the ban,\u201d Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University, told ABC News. But, he added, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds.",
      "Congress voted in favor of the ban only seven months ago. In the House of Representatives, the ban passed by an overwhelming margin of 352-65. In the Senate, 79 members voted in favor of the measure, while 18 opposed and 3 abstained.",
      "A repeal effort carries political risks for Trump, since it could be perceived as conciliatory toward China, in contrast with the adversarial tone voiced by Trump on the campaign trail, James Lewis, a data security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a political problem,\u201d Lewis said, noting that Trump could soften potential backlash by seeking a reform of the law rather than an outright repeal.",
      "Trump may not need Congress to repeal the ban. A lawsuit against the ban brought by TikTok on First Amendment grounds currently stands before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Experts who spoke to ABC News said they expect the court to rule against TikTok, but the company could then appeal, potentially sending the case to the Supreme Court before the ban takes effect. The Supreme Court may determine that the legal challenge holds sufficient merit to delay implementation of the ban, leading ultimately to a rejection of the law.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court may want a crack at this,\u201d Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who focuses on the First Amendment, told ABC News.",
      "Refuse to enforce the TikTok ban",
      "Instead of repealing the law or counting on court intervention, Trump could try to prevent the Justice Department from enforcing the measure, experts said.",
      "The law orders distributors like Apple and Google to stop offering the social media platform in their app stores, and it requires cloud service providers like Oracle to withhold the infrastructure necessary for TikTok to operate.",
      "Companies that violate the law risk a penalty of $5,000 for each user who accesses TikTok. \u201cThat adds up,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "In theory, Trump\u2019s Justice Department could opt against enforcement of the law, reassuring the likes of Apple and Oracle that the companies would not face prosecution in the event of a violation, experts said.",
      "Along similar lines, the Trump administration could take up an interpretation of the ban that affords it wide latitude in finding that TikTok has complied with a requirement that it divest from parent company ByteDance, experts said.",
      "In other words, even if TikTok has made little effort to comply with the law, the Trump administration could attempt a reading of the measure that finds the company has met the threshold necessary to avoid a ban, Rozenshtein said.",
      "If Trump opts against enforcement, the move could still prove insufficient. Companies like Apple and Oracle may decide to comply with the ban anyway, since they could face legal risk if the Trump administration reverses its approach, Rozenshtein added.",
      "\u201cTrump is mercurial,\u201d Rozenshtein said. \u201cIf you are Apple\u2019s general counsel, do you really want this hanging over you?\u201d",
      "Help TikTok find a U.S. buyer",
      "Finally, Trump could try to find a U.S. buyer for TikTok, allowing the platform to avoid a ban. This approach may appeal to Trump\u2019s self-image as a business dealmaker, but time is running short for such a significant business transaction and TikTok has shown little appetite for it, experts said.",
      "The law allows for a 90-day extension of the deadline for a TikTok sale, as long as the company is advancing toward an agreement. Under such a scenario, the deadline would move back to April, providing Trump with additional time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that he\u2019ll try to force TikTok to come to some kind of deal with American buyers,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not likely. TikTok will hold out as long as they can.\u201d",
      "China has signaled opposition to the sale of TikTok to a U.S. company, The Wall Street Journal reported in March.",
      "Alternatively, Trump could seek a compromise measure in Congress that affords him additional time and wider latitude to establish a U.S.-based operation for TikTok, experts said. Or the Trump administration could offer up an interpretation of the law that gives it space to strike a compromise with TikTok.",
      "TikTok previously proposed a solution called \u201cProject Texas,\u201d in which the company would keep all data on U.S. users within the country through a partnership with Oracle. When TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress last year, several members raised concern about a potential lack of third-party oversight in such an arrangement.",
      "Trump could seek to assuage the concerns of members of Congress while reaching terms satisfactory to TikTok, Chander said.",
      "\u201cTrump may be able to do things that reassure the American people that the app is safe, and that it is bringing a lot of the programming here to U.S. soil,\u201d Chander said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Biden administration officials are working against the clock doling out billions in grants and taking other steps to try to preserve at least some of the outgoing president's legacy before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s make every day count,\" President Joe Biden said in an address to the nation last week after Vice President Kamala Harris conceded defeat to Trump in the presidential race.",
      "Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds in Biden's landmark climate and health care law and stop clean-energy development projects.",
      "\"There\u2019s only one administration at a time,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told reporters at a news conference Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s true now, and it will also be true after January 20th. Our responsibility is to make good use of the funds that Congress has authorized for us and that we\u2019re responsible for assigning and disbursing throughout the last three years.\u201d",
      "But Trump will control more than the purse strings come January. His administration also can propose new regulations to undo some of what the Biden administration did through the rule-making process.",
      "Here are some of the moves the Biden administration is taking now:",
      "Biden administration officials hope that projects funded under the $1 trillion infrastructure law and $375 billion climate law will endure beyond Biden\u2019s term and are working to ensure that money from the landmark measures continues to flow.",
      "On Friday, Buttigieg announced over $3.4 billion in grants for projects designed to improve passenger rail service, help U.S. ports, reduce highway deaths and support domestic manufacturing of sustainable transportation materials.",
      "\u201dWe are investing in better transportation systems that touch every corner of the country and in the workers who will manufacture materials and build projects,\u2033 he said. \u201cCommunities are going to see safer commutes, cleaner air and stronger supply chains that we all count on.\u2033",
      "Announcements of major environmental grants and project approvals have sped up in recent months in what White House officials describe as \u201csprinting to the finish\u201d of Biden\u2019s four-year term.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency recently set a nationwide deadline for removal of lead pipes and announced nearly $3 billion to help local water systems comply. The agency also announced that oil and gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels.",
      "The Energy Department, meanwhile, announced a $544 million loan to a Michigan company to expand manufacturing of high-quality silicon carbide wafers for electric vehicles. The loan is one of 28 deals totaling $37 billion granted under a clean-energy loan program that was revived and expanded under Biden.",
      "\u201cThere is a new urgency to get it all done. We\u2019re seeing explosions of money going out the door,\" said Melinda Pierce, legislative director of the Sierra Club. Biden and his allies \u201dreally want to finish the job they started.\"",
      "Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters this week that Biden wants to \u201cspend down the authority that Congress has allocated and authorized before he leaves office. So we\u2019re going to work very hard to make sure that happens.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration would have to rush $7.1 billion in weapons \u2014 $4.3 billion from the 2024 supplemental and $2.8 billion that is still on the books in savings due to the Pentagon recalculating the value of systems sent \u2014 from the Pentagon\u2019s stockpiles in order to spend all of those funds obligated before Trump is sworn in.",
      "There\u2019s also another $2.2 billion available to put weapons systems on long-term contracts. However, recent aid packages have been much smaller in size, around $200 million to $300 million each.",
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the funds are already obligated, which should make them harder to take back because the incoming administration would have to reverse that.",
      "Another priority for the White House is getting Senate confirmation of as many federal judges as possible before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "The Senate this week voted 51-44 to confirm former prosecutor April Perry as a U.S. District Court judge in northern Illinois. More than a dozen pending judicial nominees have advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee; eight judicial nominations are awaiting committee votes and six are waiting for committee hearings.",
      "Trump has urged Republicans to oppose efforts to confirm judicial nominees. \u201cNo Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership,\u201d he wrote on social media site X on Nov. 10, before congressional Republicans chose their new leaders.",
      "The Education Department has been hurrying to finalize a new federal rule that would cancel student loans for people who face financial hardship. The proposal \u2014 one of Biden\u2019s only student loan plans that hasn\u2019t been halted by federal courts \u2014 is in a public comment period scheduled to end Dec. 2.",
      "After that, the department would have a narrow window to finalize the rule and begin carrying it out, a process that usually takes months. Like Biden\u2019s other efforts, it would almost certainly face a legal challenge.",
      "Additionally, the Biden administration has room to speed up student loan cancellation for people who were already promised relief because they were cheated by their colleges, said Aaron Ament, an Education Department official for the Obama administration and president of the National Student Legal Defense Network.",
      "Education Secretary Miguel Cardona could decide that case and others rather than hand them off to the Trump administration, which is expected to be far friendlier to for-profit colleges. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Ament said. \u201cThere\u2019s a good number of cases that have been sitting on Cardona\u2019s desk. It\u2019s hard to imagine that those would just be left untouched.\"",

      "The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb",
      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",

      "The city of Florence is taking new measures to crack down on overtourism",
      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cThis case was no layup, not for anyone. A lot of hard work went into this,\" Lopez said during the hearing.",
      "Diamond Sports had been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of Texas since it filed for protection in March 2023. The company said in a financial filing last year that it had debt of $8.67 billion.",
      "Diamond will emerge out of bankruptcy with significantly less debt \u2014 around $200 million \u2014 but also with fewer teams and networks.",
      "When Diamond entered bankruptcy, it owned 19 networks under the Bally Sports banner and had the rights to 42 professional teams (14 baseball, 16 NBA and 12 NHL).",
      "The reorganized company now operates under the FanDuel Sports Network banner after agreeing to a naming rights deal last month. It has 16 networks and carries games for 27 franchises (six baseball, 13 NBA and eight NHL).",
      "The 16 networks cover fans in 31 states. The company expects to complete the restructuring process in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cToday is a landmark day for Diamond, as we embark on a new path for our business. Diamond is now unencumbered by legacy debt, financially stable and enthusiastically supported by new ownership,\" Diamond CEO David Preschlack said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead, Diamond is well-positioned to further enhance its product offering and remains committed to delivering the highest quality live sports content in-market to fans through both linear and direct-to-consumer frameworks.\"",
      "Last month as part of the reorganization plan, Diamond voided the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays while attempting to rework the deals of the five franchises that had partial ownership of their regional sports networks.",
      "Diamond has revised deals with the Tigers and Rays, as well as reaching agreements with the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels and Miami Marlins, which include streaming rights. Talks are continuing with the Kansas City Royals.",
      "The Cincinnati Reds and Diamond have ended their joint venture, but a lawyer for Diamond said during Thursday's hearing that they would be open to resuming discussions. Shortly after the hearing, Major League Baseball announced it will produce and distribute Reds games next season.",
      "Cincinnati had a 20% stake in their RSN affiliate. Diamond bought back the Reds\u2019 stake for $1.",
      "Atlanta was the only franchise whose contract would have been unchanged, but the Braves have agreed to an amended deal, which include streaming rights.",
      "Steaming is an important avenue for Diamond as it seeks to find new audiences. The company announced on Wednesday it reached a multiyear agreement with Prime Video to make its channels available as an add-on subscription.",
      "Prime Video announced earlier this year that it would buy a minority stake in Diamond Sports.",
      "Diamond will also offer single-game pricing on its direct-to-consumer app for NBA and NHL games beginning Dec. 5.",
      "Viewers will have the option for single games at $6.99, as well as the chance to sign up for monthly or season pass subscriptions.",
      "Diamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.",

      "Reports from the North Dakota Fire Marshal's office say flares from natural gas at oil wells sparked two North Dakota wildfires earlier this fall",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Natural gas flares at oil wells sparked two North Dakota wildfires earlier this fall, according to reports from the North Dakota Fire Marshal's Office.",
      "Investigators concluded that flares combined with high winds and extremely dry weather and started a wildfire near the town of Keene and another near New Town, the Bismarck Tribune reported Thursday. Officials with ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp., which operate the oil wells, say they are still reviewing the reports.",
      "No one was killed or injured in the two fires that both began Oct. 5, but a combined 14 square miles (36.3 square kilometers) were burned, damaging land and livestock.",
      "The fires were among several in northwestern North Dakota in October that burned up to 118,000 square miles (477.6 square km). Two people died and six were injured in other North Dakota wildfires. Agencies are still investigating what caused the other fires.",
      "Flaring is the act of burning off excess natural gas that comes up along with oil. Oil and gas companies are required to flare natural gas from oil wells that cannot be captured or moved \u2014 venting natural gas is illegal and creates more pollution than flaring it.",
      "ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Lexey Long said the company is still reviewing the fire investigation report. The company is committed to providing information to the state fire marshal's office and is working directly with landowners and tenants, Long said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOur focus remains on the safety of our workers, the community and on the protection of the environment,\u201d Long said.",

      "A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death has sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "After a resounding election victory, President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans say they have a mandate to govern",
      "WASHINGTON -- After a resounding election victory, delivering what President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans said is a mandate to govern, an uneasy political question is emerging: Will there be any room for dissent in the U.S. Congress?",
      "Trump is laying down a gauntlet even before taking office challenging the Senate, in particular, to dare defy him over the nominations of Matt Gaetz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions.",
      "The promise of unified government, with the Republican Party\u2019s sweep of the White House and GOP majorities in the House and Senate, is making way for a more complicated political reality as congressional leaders confront anew what it means to line up with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a red alert moment for American democracy,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on CNN after Trump tapped Gaetz for attorney general.",
      "Trump is returning to the White House at the height of his political power, having won both the Electoral College and the popular vote for his party for the first time in decades. The trifecta in Washington offers a tantalizing political opportunity for Republicans, opening up a universe of political and policy priorities \u2014 from tax cuts to mass deportations to the gutting of the regulatory and federal bureaucracy, along with Trump's vows to seek vengeance and prosecution of his perceived enemies and pardon those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But for Congress, it\u2019s also a potentially existential moment, one that is testing whether its status as a co-equal branch of U.S. government can withstand a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cOne of the possible futures for Congress is that it becomes a rubber stamp,\u201d said Phillip Wallach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who writes extensively about Congress.",
      "Wallach said the threat to Congress has been on his mind, but he also believes it would be more pronounced if Republicans had won larger majorities. The House, in fact, may end up with slimmer numbers, and the Senate's 53-seat advantage, while more than the simple majority needed to confirm nominees, can hardly be seen as mandates.",
      "Besides, \u201cthey\u2019re not wimps,\u201d he said of elected lawmakers. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for them to just turn themselves into a doormat.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a changed Washington from Trump\u2019s first term. Congress has been purged of his strongest critics. At the same time, the Supreme Court has shifted dramatically rightward, with three Trump-appointed justices, and a majority decision over the summer that granted the president broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks are posing the biggest early test for Congress.",
      "While Trump's choice of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state is expected to have somewhat broad support, including from Democrats, others like Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Pete Hegseth as defense secretary are raising more scrutiny.",
      "The choice of Gaetz, a fierce Trump loyalist who talks about the wholesale upheaval of the Justice Department, is all the more troubling for senators because of a House ethics probe over alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He denies the allegations but submitted his resignation from Congress as soon as he was nominated, effectively shutting down the probe.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would consider the Gaetz nomination, called on the House to \u201cpreserve and share their report\" with the panel.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican member of the Judiciary committee, said he expects \u201cany and all\u201d information on the nominees will be made available.",
      "Other Republicans in the House and Senate stood with Gaetz, supporting his effort to take on the Justice Department over what they see as perceived bias, particularly over its prosecutions of Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Capitol attack and for hoarding classified documents.",
      "\"I know the Democrats are clutching their pearls right now, and they\u2019re very, very upset about everything,\" said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., on Fox News.",
      "\u201cBut if you think about how they have weaponized the DOJ, this is a situation that needs serious reform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s President Trump\u2019s prerogative to choose who he wants to nominate.\u201d",
      "Incoming Senate GOP Leader John Thune said confirming Trump's nominations will be a priority next year and senators \u201cshould expect an aggressive schedule until his nominees are confirmed.\u201d",
      "Complicating the matter for senators is the Trump campaign's decision to not engage, so far, in the traditional transition process, having declined to sign agreements with the federal government that would launch FBI background checks of nominees, among other standard steps before confirmation hearings.",
      "Senators may be forced to consider nominees that have not been vetted in the traditional ways.",
      "Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a former member of the House Intelligence Committee, worried Americans may be left in the dark about their top officials. \u201cPeople have a right to know who\u2019s leading critical aspects of their government,\u201d he said.",
      "Intensifying his demands on the Senate, Trump suggested it should consider so-called recess appointments of his nominees \u2014 a highly unorthodox request that essentially asks the Senate to drop its constitutional advise-and-consent role and allow his nominees to be installed without a vote.",
      "Wallach said if senators chose that route it would be \u201can act of extreme institutional self-sabotage.\u201d",
      "Congress has been here before, in the first Trump administration, when the White House tested the limits of its executive power.",
      "One of the most significant confrontations of that earlier Trump era was over his promised border wall, when the White House tried to poach congressionally approved funds for military base construction projects and repurpose them for the wall between the U.S. and Mexico.",
      "Congress largely won that round, after long fights, but it's about to be tested in new ways.",
      "Trump is planning a series of executive orders on Day One of the new administration to launch his mass deportations and other priorities.",
      "Trump allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and influential commentator Charlie Kirk, have warned of consequences in the form of primary challenges to senators who fail to confirm nominees.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the on-again-off-again Trump ally, said he typically confirms a president's nominees, regardless of party, and intends to be a yes vote again.",
      "\u201cI consider this matter closed,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201c wokeness \u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d",
      "The president-elect wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices. He wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he\u2019s won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.",
      "Trump\u2019s education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to \u201cany school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would \u201cnot give one penny\u201d to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.",
      "He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.",
      "Trump\u2019s opponents say his vision of America\u2019s schools is warped by politics \u2014 that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.",
      "\u201cIt's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda,\u201d said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. \u201cThere is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs.\u201d",
      "Trump's platform calls for \u201cmassive funding preferences\u201d for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programs and allow parents to elect school principals.",
      "Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the U.S. Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by \u201cradicals.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s public K-12 schools get about 14% of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.",
      "Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.",
      "Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights \u2014 the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.",
      "The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term. That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a Day One loss of funding,\u201d Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues.\u201d",
      "Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.",
      "To get colleges to shutter diversity programs \u2014 which Trump says amount to discrimination \u2014 he said he \u201cwill advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.",
      "Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.",
      "Universities hope their relationship with the administration won\u2019t be as antagonistic as Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests.",
      "\u201cEducation has been an easy target during the campaign season,\u201d said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. \u201cBut a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars \u2014 the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return \u201call education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are \u201cfree from political meddling.\u201d",
      "Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarizing issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.",
      "Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.",
      "\u201cTrump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn\u2019t run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to,\u201d Eden said.",
      "Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for \u201cpatriotic\u201d education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a \u201cchallenge to American principles\u201d alongside fascism.",
      "Adding to that effort, Trump is proposing a new credentialing body to certify teachers \u201cwho embrace patriotic values.\u201d",
      "Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.",
      "More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden\u2019s Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t detailed his plans for student loans, though he has called Biden\u2019s cancellation proposals illegal and unfair.",
      "Most of Biden\u2019s signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.",

      "The three were found guilty Oct. 3 of federal witness tampering charges in the death of Nichols, 29, whose beating was caught on police video that has been released to the public. Haley was also convicted on two federal civil rights violations and a charge of conspiracy to witness tamper. They are scheduled for sentencing on the federal convictions in January.",
      "The three, along with Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded after Nichols' beating.",
      "Mills and Martin pleaded guilty ahead of the federal trial, and they testified for prosecutors. Their sentences are pending. Mills and Martin also are expected to change their pleas in state court, which allows them to avoid a murder trial.",
      "Nichols, who was Black, had run from a traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. He died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. The five officers, who also are Black, were fired and then indicted in the death, which sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing.",

      "The state plans to appeal the entirety of deGravelles\u2019 order, but the emergency appeal at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is aimed at just one aspect of it. State attorneys say the judge overstepped his authority when he ordered that all local school boards be notified of his finding because only five districts are named as defendants in a legal challenge to the law.",
      "Those districts are in East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Tammany, Orleans and Vernon parishes.",

      "Demand Justice, a progressive organization focused on the judiciary, is set to bombard Capitol Hill with a message for the closing weeks of the 118th Congress: Do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to confirm President Joe Biden\u2019s nominees as a second Donald Trump pr...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Demand Justice, a progressive organization focused on the judiciary, is set to bombard Capitol Hill with a message for the closing weeks of the 118th Congress: Do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to confirm President Joe Biden\u2019s nominees as a second Donald Trump presidency looms.",
      "The Republican president-elect's victory and the GOP takeover of the Senate leaves just seven weeks of Democratic control of the chamber.",
      "Democrats have confirmed 213 of Biden\u2019s judicial nominees during his presidency. Another few dozen are still pending. To add to those confirmations, Senate Democrats would need to stay in Washington far longer than they had planned and also navigate a razor-thin margin that hamstrung them at times on other Biden priorities.",
      "Trump focused heavily on filling court vacancies in his first term, getting 234 judges confirmed, including three to the Supreme Court. Democrats are seeking to deny him more opportunities to name conservative judges as the party determines its path forward after a sweeping defeat that will leave it out of power come January.",
      "\u201cSenate Democrats cannot give up and go home just because they lost the chamber,\u201d said Skye Perryman, a senior adviser to Demand Justice, whose push will include widespread lobbying, Capitol Hill events and targeted ads. \u201cIt is even more critical now that good, qualified, fair-minded judges are confirmed so they can serve as a backstop and uphold the rights of ordinary people and protect our Constitution.\u201d",
      "According to the United States Courts website, 17 pending judicial nominees have advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, eight are waiting for votes from the committee and six are waiting for committee hearings. The White House announced new judicial nominees in October and November.",
      "The Senate returned this week from their break around the election. The Senate calendar has the legislative body being out of town around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. But the calendar is subject to change, and it is common for senators to leave Washington for extended weekend breaks.",
      "The push will confront an already full schedule in the Senate, too. In addition to confirmations, the legislative body will be tasked with providing more disaster aid after a string of deadly storms, passing the annual defense policy bill, and keeping the government funded and open.",
      "Some Democratic-caucusing senators like West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema, both independents, are leaving the chamber at the end of this session. And if Republicans are unified to oppose Biden's picks, Manchin has said he will not support judicial appointments that are not bipartisan, shrinking the Democratic margin.",
      "One nominee, April Perry, was confirmed on Monday evening for the northern district of Illinois.",
      "Asked about the effort to pressure Senate Democrats to do all they can to confirm these nominees, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \u201cWe are going to get as many done as we can.\u201d",
      "Trump on Sunday urged Republicans to oppose Schumer\u2019s efforts. \u201cNo Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cDelaying the confirmation of strongly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2014 meaning there is every urgent reason for Republicans and Democrats to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\u201d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in response to Trump. \u201cThere is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he hoped Republicans would not seek to delay confirmation votes for judges, noting that Democrats agreed to a package of 12 judicial confirmations at the end of the first Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cI hope they follow the precedent,\u201d Durbin said.",
      "He added that he hopes to get about two dozen judicial nominees confirmed during the lame-duck session.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just about all we can do,\u201d he added.",
      "Perryman from Demand Justice echoed that sentiment. \u201cThere is no excuse not to put these qualified individuals on the floor for a vote. Americans all across the country are working overtime to make ends meet, and the Senate should work overtime too: Americans deserve better from their elected officials than excuses or delays,\" Perryman added.",
      "According to operatives working with Demand Justice, the group\u2019s plan includes a widespread lobbying effort aimed at key senators, press events urging action and a new website that gives constituents a chance to see where the effort stands.",
      "\u201cWith only weeks left before the new Congress, it\u2019s more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session,\u201d said Maggie Jo Buchanan, a top operative at the progressive organization.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in a series of post-election posts reflecting on Trump\u2019s win, urged Schumer to \u201cuse every minute of the end-of-year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators \u2014 none of whom can be removed by the next President.\u201d",
      "And groups like The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights have echoed this focus.",
      "\u201cAs the Senate returns to Washington and with limited time remaining, it is critically important that our senators immediately vote on all of President Biden\u2019s judicial nominees,\u201d said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program and an advisor at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Just hours after Republican Sen. John Thune was elected as the incoming Senate majority leader on Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump presented him with one of his first tests \u2014 an announcement that he intends to nominate controversial Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general.",
      "The Florida Republican is one of the more universally disliked members of Congress, including among GOP lawmakers after he led the effort to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year. He has spent his congressional career agitating against the Justice Department and has been under a House Ethics investigation probing whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz denies the allegations.",
      "Asked about the nomination as he left a Senate vote, Thune smiled and declined to answer. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good question for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,\u201d he said.",
      "An hour earlier, the likely incoming chairman of the Judiciary panel, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, also deflected, saying he doesn\u2019t know Gaetz but will look at the nomination. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me any other questions,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar posture for Republican senators who have lived through the last eight years dodging questions about Trump and defending him, even after he tried to overturn his election defeat in 2020 and his supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol. But the stakes are even higher now that he has been decisively elected to a second term. Congressional Republicans have rallied intensely around him, betting their political futures on his success.",
      "Two months before Trump even takes office, he is already challenging those congressional Republicans to defy him as he nominates potentially controversial figures to his Cabinet \u2014 including Gaetz, former Democratic House Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and conservative media personality Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense. On Sunday, Trump even said in a post on X that he wants the new Senate leader to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing confirmation votes altogether.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of a test,\u201d said Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who called the Gaetz nomination a \u201cHail Mary\u201d pass from Trump. Cramer said he sees Gaetz as a disruptive force in the House and has concerns about the \u201cserious allegations\u201d against him, but stopped short of saying he wouldn\u2019t vote for his confirmation.",
      "\u201cIt will take a lot of political capital to get him across,\u201d Cramer said, adding that \u201cthere will forever be tension between the branches.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s unclear is how much political capital Trump will have to expend to get his picks through \u2014 or whether it will even be necessary. Republicans will have a 53-seat majority in the Senate next year, giving them room to lose a few votes.",
      "Immediately after his election as the incoming GOP leader, Thune suggested that the Senate will not fully relinquish its power to vet nominations \u2014 but kept the door open to Trump\u2019s suggested changes.",
      "\u201cThe Senate has an advise and consent rule in the Constitution,\u201d Thune said, adding that Senate Republicans will do everything they can to get Trump\u2019s nominees quickly in place.",
      "\u201cHow that happens remains to be seen,\u201d Thune said.",
      "While Trump\u2019s announcement about Gaetz sent an immediate shock wave around Capitol Hill, many Republican senators who will be tasked with confirming him were reluctant to publicly criticize the pick.",
      "Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary panel, said he didn\u2019t know Gaetz \u201cother than his public persona,\" and said he won\u2019t \u201cprejudge any of these\u201d nominations.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, elected Wednesday as the incoming No. 2 Republican in the Senate next year, would only say that Trump \u201cis going to continue to make his appointments. We\u2019re going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing for you,\u201d said Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin when asked whether he would support Gaetz\u2019s confirmation.",
      "A few GOP senators praised Gaetz, who resigned from the House shortly after the announcement, ending the House Ethics investigation and making way for a replacement to be elected before the new Congress is sworn in Jan. 3.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Matt for a very long time, we\u2019re friends,\u201d said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was nominated for secretary of state Wednesday, but was instead flooded with questions about Gaetz. \u201cI think he would do a very good job for the president.\u201d",
      "Gaetz is \u201ca smart, clever guy,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, though he said \u201che\u2019ll have to answer some tough questions in the hearing, and we\u2019ll see how he does.\u201d",
      "Other Republican senators, like Cramer, were skeptical while stopping short of saying they would oppose his nomination.",
      "Gaetz \u201cwill have his work cut out for him,\u201d said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it should \u201cmake for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing.\u201d",
      "Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by Gaetz\u2019s nomination.",
      "\u201cI recognize that the president-elect has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but we in Congress have a responsibility under the Constitution and our advise and consent, which will lead to hearings, an FBI background check and an awful lot of questions being asked in this case,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Gaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and said last year that the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls had ended with no federal charges against him.",
      "Democrats were appalled.",
      "\u201cThis nomination is the first test of whether Republicans are willing to stand up to Donald Trump and go with conscience and conviction as opposed to just politics,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Judiciary panel.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., was even more blunt.",
      "\u201cPeople voted for cheaper eggs, not whatever the f@#\u20ac this is,\u201d he posted on X, referring to last week\u2019s election.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party\u2019s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.",
      "With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump\u2019s vision for the country.",
      "The incoming president has promised to carry out the country\u2019s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government\u2019s most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.",
      "When Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court that was ideologically divided. Not this time.",
      "When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his \u201cMake America Great Again\" movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed.",
      "Trump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election.",
      "\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u2019\u201d Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trump's endorsement won the Republican Conference's nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a \u201cblowtorch\u201d to the federal government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an \u201cambitious\u201d 100-day agenda.",
      "\u201cRepublicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,\u201d Johnson said earlier this week. \u201cThe American people want us to implement and deliver that \u2018America First\u2019 agenda.\u201d",
      "Trump's allies in the House are already signaling they will seek retribution for the legal troubles Trump faced while out of office. The incoming president on Wednesday said he would nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fierce loyalist, for attorney general.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has said GOP lawmakers are \u201cnot taking anything off the table\u201d in their plans to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, even as Smith is winding down two federal investigations into Trump for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Still, with a few races still uncalled the Republicans may hold the majority by just a few seats as the new Congress begins. Trump's decision to pull from the House for posts in his administration \u2014 Reps. Gaetz, Mike Waltz and Elise Stefanik so far \u2014 could complicate Johnson's ability to maintain a majority in the early days of the new Congress.",
      "Gaetz submitted his resignation Wednesday, effective immediately. Johnson said he hoped the seat could be filled by the time the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. Replacements for members of the House require special elections, and the congressional districts held by the three departing members have been held by Republicans for years.",
      "With the thin majority, a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed. The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson \u2014 at times with Trump's help \u2014 largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump's election victory.",
      "The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay onboard for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of its election losses.",
      "In the Senate, GOP leaders, fresh off winning a convincing majority, are already working with Trump to confirm his Cabinet picks. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota won an internal election Wednesday to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history.",
      "Thune in the past has been critical of Trump, but praised the incoming president during his leadership election bid.",
      "\u201cThis Republican team is united. We are on one team,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "The GOP\u2019s Senate majority of 53 seats also ensures that Republicans will have breathing room when it comes to confirming Cabinet posts, or Supreme Court justices if there is a vacancy. Not all those confirmations are guaranteed. Republicans were incredulous Wednesday when the news hit Capitol Hill that Trump would nominate Gaetz as his attorney general. Even close Trump allies in the Senate distanced themselves from supporting Gaetz, who had been facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Still, Trump on Sunday demanded that any Republican leader must allow him to make administration appointments without a vote while the Senate is in recess. Such a move would be a notable shift in power away from the Senate, yet all the leadership contenders quickly agreed to the idea. Democrats could potentially fight such a maneuver.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's social media supporters, including Elon Musk, the world's richest man, clamored against picking a traditional Republican to lead the Senate chamber. Thune worked as a top lieutenant to McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d in his private notes.",
      "However, McConnell made it clear that on Capitol Hill the days of Republican resistance to Trump are over.",

      "The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued the first round of permits allowing Enbridge to reroute an aging pipeline around a tribal reservation",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Enbridge's contentious plan to reroute an aging pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation moved closer to reality Thursday after the company won its first permits from state regulators.",
      "Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials announced they have issued construction permits for the Line 5 reroute around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The energy company still needs discharge permits from the DNR as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "The project has generated fierce opposition. The tribe wants the pipeline off its land, but tribal members and environmentalists maintain rerouting construction will damage the region's watershed and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels.",
      "The DNR issued the construction permits with more than 200 conditions attached. The company must complete the project by Nov. 14, 2027, hire DNR-approved environmental monitors and allow DNR employees to access the site during reasonable hours.",
      "The company also must notify the agency within 24 hours of any permit violations or hazardous material spills affecting wetlands or waterways; can\u2019t discharge any drilling mud into wetlands, waterways or sensitive areas; keep spill response equipment at workspace entry and exit points; and monitor for the introduction and spread in invasive plant species.",
      "Enbridge officials issued a statement praising the approval, calling it a \u201cmajor step\u201d toward construction that will keep reliable energy flowing to Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region.",
      "Bad River tribal officials warned in their own statement Thursday that the project calls for blasting, drilling and digging trenches that would devastate area wetlands and streams and endanger the tribe's wild rice beds. The tribe noted that investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the Line 3 pipeline\u2019s construction in northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cI'm angry that the DNR has signed off on a half-baked plan that spells disaster for our homeland and our way of life,\u201d Bad River Chairman Robert Blanchard said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue sounding the alarm to prevent yet another Enbridge pipeline from endangering our watershed.\u201d",
      "Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters) of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario. About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the pipeline run across the Bad River reservation.",
      "The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the pipeline from the reservation, arguing the 71-year-old line is prone to a catastrophic spill and land easements allowing Enbridge to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation's southern border.",
      "The company has only about two years to complete the project. U.S. District Judge William Conley last year ordered Enbridge to shut down the portion of pipeline crossing the reservation within three years and pay the tribe more than $5 million for trespassing. An Enbridge appeal is pending in a federal appellate court in Chicago.",
      "Michigan\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in a federal appellate court.",
      "Michigan regulators in December approved the company\u2019s $500 million plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."

      "NEW YORK -- Four bystanders were shot dead in the last 18 months because of gang rivalries in upper Manhattan, authorities said Thursday as they announced the indictments of dozens of people in a yearslong welter of gunfire, robberies, weapons deals, car crashes and more.",
      "One shooting injured a woman who was eight months pregnant and was sitting in a parked car, police and prosecutors said. Another sent bullets flying into a crowded basketball court, where an onlooker was hit in the chest.",
      "Those victims survived. But four other bystanders, aged 44 to 66, did not.",
      "The violence \u201cimpacted the entire neighborhood \u2014 a climate of fear among ordinary residents,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at a news conference.",
      "The 30 defendants are charged with various crimes, with some facing murder charges. Some defendants have pleaded not guilty, while others have yet to be arraigned.",
      "Prosecutors say a 2018 killing touched off a chain of retaliatory brutality among three groups, known as the 200/8 Block, the 6 Block crew and the Own Every Dollar crew, also dubbed O.E.D.",
      "Authorities say the groups operate in the Inwood area and adjacent Washington Heights, the neighborhood where the Tony Award-winning musical and movie \u201cIn The Heights\u201d are set.",
      "In text and social media messages, members threatened rivals and talked up violent plans, according to the indictment. One defendant told an ally to hang out with one of their rivals, smoke pot with him and bring him downstairs, adding, \u201cHe gonna get it bad. Make sure he don\u2019t got a knife or nothing,\u201d",
      "Altogether, the groups are accused of 18 shootings that killed a total of seven people.",
      "The prosecutions are \u201cgoing to have a huge impact\u201d on safety in the neighborhood, NYPD Deputy Chief Brian Gill said at the news conference."

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Several business owners at the struggling corner where George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 are suing the city to demand it take over their properties and compensate them.",
      "The owners of the Cup Foods convenience store and other businesses operating near 38th Street and Chicago Avenue argue that the city's failure to address deterioration and crime in the neighborhood has ruined their businesses and constitutes an unlawful taking of their property without just compensation, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported Thursday. They're seeking $30 million in damages.",
      "The area, now known as George Floyd Square, has become a place of pilgrimage for social justice supporters from across the country, and the store has renamed itself Unity Foods. But business owners say they haven't benefitted, while activists and officials remain divided over how to transform the intersection while keeping it as a permanent memorial.",
      "Floyd died after a white officer pinned his neck to the pavement outside Cup Foods for 9 1/2 minutes despite the Black man\u2019s pleas of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The ensuing protests, which turned violent at times, tested the leadership of Gov. Tim Walz at one of the state\u2019s most consequential moments, and sparking a nationwide reckoning over racism and police misconduct. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder.",
      "The legal action, filed last week in Hennepin County District Court, argues that the businesses have lost revenue, real estate value, reputation, and tenant and rental income. It argues that the city's decisions led to higher crime and created a \u201cno go zone\u201d for police in the area. It replaces an earlier lawsuit by the businesses that was dismissed two months ago.",
      "Michael Healey, the lawyer representing the businesses, told the Star Tribune there are two possible outcomes. The businesses \"could conceivably keep the property if a settlement is reached with the city on the diminished value,\u201d he said. The other possibility is that the city could begin the process of taking the properties and compensating the owners.",
      "A city spokesperson said in a statement that while it can\u2019t comment on pending litigation, the city \u201cunderstands the challenges that residents and businesses have confronted in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder.\u201c"

      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F",
      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world\u2019s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.",
      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "No medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "That same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN\u2019T PAYING ATTENTION.\u201d",
      "The World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.",
      "In a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy\u2019s personal Twitter account was the top \u201csuperspreader\u201d of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.",
      "He has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Kennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group\u2019s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series\u2019 \u201cOverall Sales Leaderboard.\u201d",
      "His group has co-published a number of anti-vaccine books that have been debunked. One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.",
      "An AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "NEW YORK -- Two lawyers say they can no longer represent Rudy Giuliani in a legal fight over property he's been ordered to give up to satisfy part of a $148 million defamation judgment against him. They asked a judge to remove them from the case, citing disagreements with the former New York City mayor.",
      "The request in federal court comes a week after a judge ordered Giuliani to turn over by Friday a Mercedes that once belonged to actress Lauren Bacall, an heirloom watch and other prized assets to two former Georgia election workers who sued him over his remarks about them as he fought to overturn President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss.",
      "The women were awarded the judgment last year. Giuliani then filed for bankruptcy, but a judge cut that short after finding that the ex-mayor had flouted the process. Lawyers for the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, say Giuliani has avoided turning over his assets.",
      "In a filing late Wednesday, attorney Kenneth Caruso sought permission for himself and co-counsel David Labkowski to stop representing Giuliani.",
      "Caruso wrote that lawyers may withdraw from representing clients when there is a \u201cfundamental disagreement,\u201d or when a client insists on presenting a claim that is not warranted under the law and cannot be supported by a good-faith argument, or when the client fails to cooperate.",
      "Several paragraphs of the publicly posted filing are blacked out. The redacted version does not provide details on possible issues.",
      "A representative for Giuliani didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email and a phone call seeking comment.",
      "Giuliani has until Monday to oppose the motion.",
      "The massive defamation judgment stems from Giuliani\u2019s role in pushing Trump\u2019s unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him. That effort also resulted in pending criminal charges against Giuliani in Georgia and Arizona.",
      "The ex-mayor and longtime Trump ally has been defiant amid the collection efforts, which have stretched past an Oct. 29 deadline. He told reporters outside court last week he was the victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta.\u201d On Election Day, Giuliani was seen riding near a polling place in Palm Beach, Florida, in a Mercedes that appeared to be the car he was supposed to turn over.",
      "Giuliani, who has since been disbarred in New York and Washington, had falsely accused Freeman and Moss of ballot fraud, saying they snuck in ballots in suitcases, counted ballots multiple times and tampered with voting machines."

      "Burgum, 67, grew up in tiny Arthur, North Dakota, population 328. He earned a bachelor's degree from North Dakota State University and his master\u2019s of business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.",
      "He went on to become a wealthy software executive. He led Great Plains Software, which Microsoft acquired for $1.1 billion in 2001. Burgum stayed on as a vice president until 2007. He's also led other companies in real estate development and venture capital.",
      "In 2016, Burgum ran for governor, his first campaign for elected office. He touted a message of \u201creinventing\u201d government as the state dealt with a massive revenue shortfall.",
      "In a major upset, Burgum defeated North Dakota's longtime attorney general in the Republican gubernatorial primary. He handily won his first term in the strong Republican state, which has about 784,000 residents.",
      "He was easily reelected in 2020.",
      "Burgum has taken a business-oriented bent as governor of North Dakota, where agriculture and oil are the main industries. He's pushed income tax cuts, reduced regulations, and changes to animal agriculture laws and higher education governance. Burgum also emphasized a \u201cdata-driven\u201d approach to governing, advocated for a Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in the state and prioritized engagement with tribal nations.",
      "Burgum and his wife, Kathryn, have been public about her recovery from addiction, and as governor he has prioritized resources for addiction treatment.",
      "Burgum is known as a policy wonk who works long hours and is highly inquisitive.",
      "He has largely resisted wading into social issues, such as anti-LGBTQ measures pushed by members of his own party, vetoing a few such bills in 2021 and 2023. But also in 2023, as he was planning a run for president, he signed a pile of bills opponents said targeted transgender people. They included a ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender kids, sports bans for transgender athletes, and transgender restrictions in schools.",
      "Burgum ran for president from June to December 2023. He campaigned on priorities of energy, economy and national security, but dropped out after his bid failed to resonate.",
      "He appeared in two Republican debates \u2014 including the first, which he attended after hurting his Achilles tendon playing basketball. He drew attention for his campaign offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 to his campaign so he would have enough individual donors to make the debate stage.",
      "In January, before the Iowa caucuses, he endorsed Trump. The same month, he declined to seek a third term as governor.",
      "When he entered office in December 2016, he dealt with the final months of the sometimes-chaotic protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. He's led the state through terrible droughts and crippling storms.",
      "He was the face of North Dakota's response to the coronavirus pandemic, holding dozens of press conferences, many of them daily in early 2020, including an emotional plea about face masks. He and his wife publicly received their COVID vaccinations in 2021.",
      "Last year, amid his presidential campaign, Burgum called a special session for the Legislature to deal with a budget mess weeks after the state Supreme Court voided a crucial bill, putting some state funding in jeopardy."

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana lawmakers on Thursday postponed a vote on a key bill in Gov. Jeff Landry's sweeping and complex tax reform package.",
      "Most of Landry's proposed bills, granting approximately $2 billion in income and corporate tax cuts, have moved smoothly through the House of Representatives during the state's third special legislative session of the year. But lawmakers have raised more resistance to a sales tax on dozens of services such as lawnmowing, getting tattoos and using coin-operated laundry machines.",
      "Tabling the bill, which would have raised an estimated $500 million to plug the revenue hole created by the tax cuts, raises questions about whether Landry and his allies have rounded up enough support. The GOP-dominated House requires 70 of its 105 members to vote in support of the bill.",
      "\u201cI think the bill is on life support if it isn\u2019t dead already,\u201d said Republican Rep. Joe Stagni.",

      "Rep. Julie Emerson, who is responsible for several of the tax reform bills, said some of her colleagues were opposed outright to the entire bill increasing taxes on services, while others had issues with specific services being taxed.",
      "In committee hearings, lobbyists have argued the proposed services to be taxed, including for property repairs and maintenance, would raise costs for small businesses and elevate insurance rates.",
      "But House lawmakers voted 71-23 to make a temporary 0.40% sales tax increase permanent. Lawmakers shaved off 0.05% to bring the state\u2019s proposed overall sales tax rate down to 4.40%. They also planned to repeal dozens of tax breaks, but would keep household groceries from being taxed.",
      "That sales tax expansion would raise around $820 million in annual revenue.",
      "\u201cWith a sales tax, a person has a choice,\" said Republican Rep. Mark Wright, who sponsored the increased sales tax bill. \u201cWith an income tax, there is no choice.\u201d",
      "Some fiscal conservatives have indicated opposition to levying new sales taxes on services, with a small group of Republicans voting against making the sales tax increase permanent.",
      "A group of Democratic lawmakers have also argued that the sales tax expansion will weigh more heavily on lower-income households.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s tax system is one of the most regressive in the nation, with lower-income families paying a higher percentage of their earnings toward income and sales taxes than wealthier households, according to research from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. A study funded by a coalition of non-partisan economic policy groups found the proposed reforms would make the existing system modestly more progressive, but did not factor in potential increases in local sales taxes.",
      "Landry has said the tax reform is modeled after policies adopted by states like North Carolina and Texas, which he says are out-competing Louisiana economically. He has said passing the tax reform package will make the state more attractive for job-generating businesses, and his allies point out that the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, currently ranks Louisiana as 40th in terms of tax competitiveness.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the proposed taxes on numerous services can be effectively enforced.",
      "Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier, representing several southwest Louisiana parishes, said in a committee hearing on Nov. 13 that he did not believe his constituents would fully comply with the new sales taxes.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t count on my district to do it, them boys they take cash, they\u2019ll trade it for a fifth ... of vodka or food stamps,\u201d he said.",
      "On Wednesday, the House passed a bill to reduce corporate income tax from a 7.5% to 3.5% flat rate and another to add new taxes on digital goods and services like online streaming sites, expected to bring in around $40 million a year. They have also passed bills to eliminate the 0.275% corporate franchise tax \u2014 worth more than $500 million in annual revenue \u2014 and to flatten the individual income tax to 3%, costing the state approximately $1.3 billion in revenue.",

      "Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI business group, said firms had widely reported \"a slowdown in decision making\" prior to the Budget. He added that once it had been announced it had \"set off warning lights for business\".",

      "Shares in vaccine makers and healthcare firms around the world slid sharply on Friday, as investors warned that Donald Trump's choice of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US Health Secretary could pose new challenges to the sector.",
      "Kennedy is known as a vaccine sceptic and, if confirmed in the post, has vowed to use it to crack down on \u201cBig Pharma\u201d.",

That campaign spotlighted calls for increased restrictions on food chemicals and dyes, cutting ultra-processed foods from school lunches and forcing drug companies to share more information about vaccines.",
      "If his nomination is ratified by the Senate and he is empowered to act on his pledges, it would mark a change in approach, not only from the Biden administration but from Trump's first term, which saw the government pour money into helping firms develop Covid vaccines, while taking a hands-off approach to regulation.",
      "However, Trump also drew alarm in the industry with efforts to lower drug prices, including by making it easier to import medicine from Canada.",

      "Asked for comment about the pick, Steve Ubl, head of the US trade association for pharmaceutical manufacturers, defended the industry, noting its success fighting disease such as polio and smallpox and its major role in the economy.",
      "\"We want to work with the Trump administration to further strengthen our innovation ecosystem and improve healthcare for patients,\" he said in a statement, without mentioning Kennedy by name.",
      "He called on policymakers to focus on addressing chronic disease with prevention and reforming America's complicated health system to make medicine more affordable."

      "The UK must \"rebuild relations\" with the EU \"while respecting the decision of the British people\" who voted to leave in 2016, the Bank of England's governor has said.",
      "Andrew Bailey's Mansion House speech to investors marked some of his strongest comments yet on Brexit, saying one of its consequences has been weaker trade.",
      "He has previously avoided commenting on the topic because of the Bank's independence from Westminster politics.",

      "'Crown jewel'",
      "In her speech, Reeves said that regulations brought in after the 2008 global financial crisis \"resulted in a system which sought to eliminate risk-taking\", adding that has now \"gone too far\".",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is planning what she calls the \"biggest pension reform in decades\" in an attempt to boost economic growth.",
      "The government wants to merge the UK's 86 council pension schemes into a handful of \"pension megafunds\".",
      "It is hoped the changes will lead to billions of pounds being invested in the UK in areas such as energy infrastructure, tech start-ups and public services.",
      "Reeves told the BBC that UK public sector pension funds in their current form were not big enough to generate good returns for British savers, but some argue the changes are not without risk.",
      "What will it mean for my pension?",
      "Workers in local government schemes have a pension based on salary and service length - known as a defined benefit pension - and they will not see any change to their payments as a result of the plans.",
      "Most private sector workers are in schemes where they pay into a savings pot each month, and their eventual pension depends upon the size of this when they retire.",
      "The government is considering setting a minimum size requirement for these defined contributions schemes. It is hoped that larger funds will be more efficient to run and generate greater returns, which could mean people's pension savings grow faster.",
      "Will Rachel Reeves' public sector pension plans work?",
      "Reeves told the BBC ahead of her first speech as chancellor at the annual Mansion House gathering of investors in London that she wants the UK's pension schemes to be more like Canada and Australia.",
      "In those countries, pensions of local government workers, such as teachers and civil servants, are pooled into a handful of funds which are able to make big investments around the world.",
      "\"They probably have the best pension funds anywhere in the world,\" Reeves said.",
      "The pension reforms are part of Reeves' plan to boost growth and come after many businesses have criticised the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in the Budget.",
      "She told the BBC that she is \"not immune to those criticisms, but it was necessary to increase taxes\u201d to get the state finances in shape and \u201cproperly fund\u201d public services.",
      "The government plans to merge the 86 council pension funds - which include \u00a3354bn in investments and are run by local government officials - into \"megafunds\" run by fund managers.",
      "The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesperson has acknowledged that new pension \u201cmega funds\u201d will not be obliged to invest in UK businesses or infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t looking at mandating of investment, this is about bringing forward the reforms necessary to create scale in our pension funds.\u201d",
      "The government also wants to set a minimum size limit on defined contribution schemes in the private sector, which manage around \u00a3800bn of investments, to encourage the consolidation of the around 60 different multi-employer schemes.",
      "The government says its changes could \"unlock\" \u00a380bn worth of investment into the UK.",
      "\"Our pension funds in Britain are too small to be making the investments that get a good return for people saving for retirement and to help our economy to grow,\" Reeves said.",

      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "What is NI and how much do workers and employers pay?",
      "Cutting costs",
      "The UK's pension fund market is \"incredibly fragmented\", according to Helen Morrissey, pensions expert at Hargreaves Landsdown.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs.",
      "If larger funds are created by combining smaller ones, Ms Morrissey says, they will have the scale to invest in larger projects.",
      "They also have greater bargaining power to drive down fees, which should increase investment returns, and could have the ability to hire their own investment experts.",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC:  \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Canadian pension fund, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, bought the company that owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports in a deal worth more than \u00a31.5bn.",

      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:36:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

      "Over time Infowars was increasingly embraced by Donald Trump\u2019s allies and his supporters. During his first run for president, Trump appeared on Infowars and told Jones: \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d",

      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",

      "The move has been branded \"disastrous\" by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), with some farmers warning it would decimate the countryside.",
      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",
      "The Treasury said 40% of APR had been going to \"the 7% wealthiest claimants\", and that it had \"made a difficult decision to ensure the relief is fiscally sustainable\".",

      "There is also a dispute around the figures used to calculate the changes.",

      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",
      "Clive Bailey, founder of the Farming Forum which is also organising a protest in central London next week, said on Thursday that any change to the new rules \u201cwould be a step forward\u201d.",
      "Mr Bailey, who farms in Staffordshire, said the suggested exemption should cover people much younger than 80.",
      "Compared with the wider population, farming sees \"a lot of people who should have retired already still working\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not special, but the economic circumstances of farming are very different to other industries.\"",

      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",

    "story": [
      "People who were mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could face a delay to potential compensation payouts.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is consulting on giving dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "However, lawyers say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",

      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",
      "It also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision on whether it will reconsider the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, described the FCA's plan as a \"sensible move\".",

      "Transport Secretary Louise Haigh has asked the Office for Rail and Road (ORR) to look at how prosecutions and enforcement for rail fare evasion are dealt with.",
      "Train operators have a number of tools to deal with passengers who have underpaid or not bought a ticket at all.",
      "It is understood the government is not seeking to strip firms of powers to prosecute criminals who deliberately avoid paying. But there has been growing concern over action taken against people who misunderstand the ticketing system.",
      "The independent review the government has announced will examine how clear ticketing terms and conditions are and how they are communicated to train users.",
      "The most serious sanction is prosecution for fare evasion, which can land passengers with a magistrates court appearance and a serious criminal record.",
      "A key question for the Office for Rail and Road will be when prosecution is the right step.",
      "The Transport Secretary told a committee of MPs on Wednesday it was clear \"people who\u2019ve made genuine mistakes shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted\".",
      "\"Make no mistake, deliberate fare-dodging has no place on our railways and must be tackled, but innocent people shouldn't feel like a genuine mistake will land them in court,\" Haigh added in a statement.",

      "Mr Williamson faced prosecution for paying \u00a31.90 less than he should have done despite admitting his error and offering to pay a fine or a new fare, prompting widespread criticism of Northern.",
      "The Department for Transport instructed the company to review its ticketing policy to ensure it was clear and fair to passengers and asked it to examine details of similar cases.",
      "Northern responded by withdrawing all live prosecutions against those pursued in similar circumstances and promised to review historical cases.",
      "The terms and conditions of Mr Williamson's railcard specified the discount was only valid for on-peak services where the original fare was \u00a312 or more. However, despite the small-print, he was able to buy a ticket that informed him he could travel at \"anytime\".",
      "Stephanie Tobyn, ORR director of strategy, policy and reform, welcomed the review.",
      "\"It is important passengers are treated fairly and dealt with consistently and proportionately when ticketing issues arise, whilst also balancing the legitimate revenue protection interests of operators and taxpayers,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Oil giant Shell has won a landmark case in the Dutch courts, overturning an earlier ruling requiring it to cut its carbon emissions by 45%.",
      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",
      "The ruling came as climate talks involving some 200 countries got under way in Azerbaijan.",
      "Shell said it was pleased with the court's decision, but Friends of the Earth Netherlands said the ruling was a setback that affected them deeply.",

      "The appeals court judge said that companies such as Shell were obliged to contribute to combating climate change based on the human right to protection against dangerous climate change.",
      "However, the court said Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and the court could not establish whether it should make a 45% cut or another percentage, as there was no current accepted agreement in climate science on the required amount.",
      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",
      "Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.",

    "title": "Why Canada could become the next nuclear energy 'superpower'",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, there is going to be a shortage in uranium, and that will subsequently impact power prices,\u201d he said.",

      "When Simon Duffy gets another energy bill, his heart sinks. \u201cIt\u2019s madly expensive,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",

    "story": [
      "Almost three quarters of universities in England will face financial problems next year - despite tuition fees increasing, the BBC has been told.",
      "A report published on Friday reveals how financial issues faced by most universities are even worse than previously thought. The Office for Students (OfS) predicts more than a third are likely to have serious cash flow problems.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sir David Behan, the regulator\u2019s chairman, called for radical change, saying course closures and university mergers might be needed for financial stability.",
      "The government is considering the long-term funding and reform of universities.",
      "Tuition fees in England will rise for current and existing students by \u00a3285 to \u00a39,535 a year for those on full-time degrees, in autumn 2025.",
      "Even so, new analysis by the OfS, the independent regulator of higher education in England, shows a worsening position for universities.",
      "The regulator had said it expected 40% of universities to be in financial deficit in 2023-24.",
      "Now the OfS says by 2025-26, 72% could be spending more money than they have coming in and may have to use an overdraft or financial reserves, with a total \u00a31.6bn deficit forecast across the sector.",
      "In 40% of institutions, cash flow may become so tight there will only be enough money in the bank to cover one month at a time of bills including salaries.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the OfS findings show \"why universities must do more to make their finances work\".",
      "Radically reimagined",
      "Sir David Behan, the OfS chairman, says a university going bust \u201cisn\u2019t imminent now\u201d, but to reduce the risk higher education needs to be \u201cradically reimagined\u201d.",
      "He suggests universities should think about \u201ca transformation of their offer\u201d, looking closely at the length and range of courses, and how to increase degree apprenticeships where tuition fees are covered mainly through the levy on larger employers.",
      "Apprentices are paid to work while they study, so students end up with less debt.",
      "Sir David says universities also need to collaborate more, and should consider mergers or whether courses at nearby institutions are too similar - saying it \"doesn't make sense\" for those universities to compete with one another.",
      "But, he says, as some universities reduce the number of courses on offer he doesn\u2019t want to see \u201ccold spots\u201d where students in more rural locations don\u2019t have a choice of courses at their nearest university.",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My 12 hours of uni each week are incredible value'",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "The outlook has worsened for universities because they have recruited fewer UK and international students than predicted.",
      "For home students, the OfS says, Ucas figures suggest numbers have increased by around 1.3% this year, compared with the optimistic 5.8% universities had predicted.",
      "Universities that traditionally required higher entry grades have fared better, because they have simply taken a bigger share by accepting some students with lower results.",
      "This has led to lower recruitment and increased pressure in universities that accept middling grades, and some smaller institutions.",
      "International recruitment has also fallen, with overall visa applications down by about 16% this year, and 20% fewer applications from India alone.",
      "Since January, most international students have been banned from bringing family members to live with them in the UK.",
      "The rule was introduced last year by Rishi Sunak's government, which committed to bringing immigration numbers down.",
      "Difficult decisions",
      "All of this comes as the government considers what to do about university funding in England from 2026, in a review likely to conclude next year.",
      "The OfS report acknowledges that the scale of change needed will not be easy.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, says universities are already \"making tough choices to control costs\", adding that the sector \"needs to continue evolving\".",
      "She says the size of the challenge \"is a source of serious concern\".",
      "The University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich has cut \u00a330m in the last 18 months - almost 10% of its annual spending.",
      "Prof David Maguire, the vice chancellor, says \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d have led to a 20% reduction in the number of courses, increased lecture group sizes, less one-to-one contact between academics and students, and fewer staff in student support including in mental health and counselling.",
      "Unlike big city universities, there are no nearby institutions to collaborate with, so remaining financially sustainable is crucial, especially for the many local students who live at home.",
      "Prof Maguire says universities need to know what tuition fees or direct funding they will get through to the next election.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want boom and bust, where one year we\u2019re up, the next year we\u2019re down,\" he says.",
      "\"That doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d",
      "The increase in National Insurance contributions the university has to pay as an employer will more than wipe out the increase in tuition fees next year, he adds.",
      "As universities cut back there is a risk to the student experience - this year the largest annual study of undergraduates found only 36% in England thought their course was good or very good value for money.",
      "Sir David says he expects \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d about what students are getting in return for fees, whether on contact hours or important services such as mental health support.",
      "He suggests business degrees are one area that might need more scrutiny to demonstrate which offer the best outcomes for students.",
      "Teddy Darvill-Cutts is a UEA occupational therapy student who says he can see where his tuition fee goes.",
      "\u201cI'm surrounded by all this up-to-date technology, everything's working well,\u201d he says.",
      "But another UEA student, Amber Bramham, says not \u201call students see the benefits equally\u201d.",
      "The financial pressures on universities could lead to very visible changes such as institutions focusing on a smaller number of courses to which they can recruit well.",
      "The forecasts published on Friday will also form part of the public debate, and private negotiations between universities and ministers considering whether tuition fees should rise further in the future.",
      "The heat is now on universities to bring down costs, with renewed scrutiny from ministers and the regulator over how they spend money.",
      "This could renew pressure around vice chancellors pay, even though it is a tiny fraction of the spending of universities with a turnover of \u00a3500m or more."

      "He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones\u2019s personal assets. This included a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns, in all totalling around $8.6m according to a court filing.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:48:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Williams was fined $5m in a plagiarism lawsuit, but a film about his life doesn't touch on the issue.",
    "story": [
      "Piece By Piece, the new documentary about musician Pharrell Williams, is unusual in many respects - not least because it is entirely animated with Lego.",
      "Critics have welcomed the film's unique visual style, calling it \"disarmingly joyous\" and \"oddly charming\" - but they've also questioned one of the film's big omissions.",
      "Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines, which Williams co-wrote, is heard briefly on the soundtrack, without referencing the song's infamous plagiarism trial, which left the musician owing $5m to the estate of Marvin Gaye.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, director Morgan Neville said he had wanted to address the controversy, but the sequence ultimately derailed the story he was trying to tell.",
      "\"I definitely thought about it. I even interviewed Robin Thicke,\" he said. \"And as a documentary filmmaker, I'm obsessed with copyright law.",
      "\"But every time I looked at trying to work it in, a scene about copyright law, it felt like it belonged in a different movie.\"",
      "The Blurred Lines trial was hugely consequential for the music industry, after a jury ruled that Williams and Thicke had copied the sound and \"feel\" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up - rather than plagiarising a specific melody.",
      "The general consensus among music lawyers and songwriters is that the verdict failed to distinguish between influence and theft.",
      "It has now become common practice for musicians to assign a share of their royalties to songs that directly inspired them.",
      "\"My take on the Blurred Lines case is that it's one of the worst judicial decisions about creativity in history,\" Neville told the BBC. \"I think Pharrell was in the right on it, and I think most creatives agree with him.\"",
      "Ultimately, that led to him omitting the story from the documentary.",
      "\"It's not like Pharrell learned a big lesson from the case. I don't know if it actually changed him in any way, which is what I'm looking for, when I'm looking at a story.\"",
      "Williams has been contacted for comment.",
      "Neville previously won an Oscar for 20 Feet From Stardom - a documentary about the forgotten lives of backing singers who feature on some of rock's biggest songs.",
      "His other documentary subjects include Keith Richards, Brian Wilson, Johnny Cash and, as a producer, Taylor Swift.",
      "With Piece By Piece hitting cinemas this month, Neville told us about the film's unexpected genesis, how he convinced Lego to come on board, and the stars who had notes about their Lego minifigures.",
      "In the film, you dramatise the moment Pharrell asked you to make the film in Lego, and your response is \u201cLego? Seriously?\u201d How true to life was that?",
      "The main difference is that when Pharrell said \u201cLego movie\u201d, I thought, \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d",
      "I knew it was a crazy idea, but an exciting idea. I think it took me five minutes to fully buy into it.",
      "Can you break it down for me? What was Pharrell\u2019s pitch?",
      "He basically said, \"People have always wanted me to tell my story, and I've never been that interested, but I love your films, and I had the idea that you could make a documentary about me, and when you were done with it, you could throw away the visuals and do it again as Lego.\"",
      "That\u2019s almost exactly what he said to me \u2013 but beyond that, he had no sense of what that meant, or what his story was. So I really had to think, what does that mean?",
      "And one thing I instantly I realised is that it's not just about taking the real-life documentary footage and making it Lego. It's using what animation can do, which is time travel and go to outer space and all kinds of things that you can't normally do in a documentary.",
      "How quickly did it go from a crazy idea to reality?",
      "It took us about a year from when we first met to starting production, because we had to meet with Lego and tell them about it.",
      "How did the conversation with Lego go?",
      "I said, \"Look, it's not a G-rated movie, but I get that it can't be R-rated [either]. It's something that has to have a little edge, and it's going to get into questions of race and other things\".",
      "And Lego, to their complete credit, said, \"Those are conversations that are good for us to have.\"",
      "They knew it would push them, but in ways that they thought were good.",
      "But they didn\u2019t fund it, they don't own it, they're just partners.",
      "What was the moment you knew it would work?",
      "Well, we had to figure out how to get somebody to pay for it, so we did a 90 second proof of concept.",
      "I interviewed Pharrell, and I cut together a scene of him listening to Stevie Wonder as a boy, on his parents' stereo \u2013 and his synaesthesia kicks in. Suddenly there's lots of colour and you can almost see what's going on in his mind. That convinced me it would work.",
      "I love the way you visualise Pharrell\u2019s beats as Lego sculptures, each with its own unique shape. It really helps illustrate the abstract concept of songwriting.",
      "Do you know, what was interesting about the beats? Pharrell, in his mind, can tell you the colour and the shape of every beat he's made. So for each of those Lego pieces, we actually worked with Pharrell to make sure they looked like what he saw in his head.",
      "When you interviewed other people for the film \u2013 Missy Elliot, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg \u2013 did you tell them it was going to be rendered in Lego?",
      "We didn\u2019t, partly because we filmed those interviews five years ago and we wanted to keep it on the down low.",
      "Then, cut to a couple years later, and I started sending out 3D renders of their characters, like, \"Here you go. This is what you're gonna look like\".",
      "It was a bit of a roll of the dice, but everyone was really excited about it.",
      "Did anyone ask for changes?",
      "Missy had a comment on her earrings, so one of the few bespoke [Lego] pieces that we made for the film were Missy's earrings.",
      "The Lego characters have a limited range of facial expressions. Did that pose a problem?",
      "The face stuff was the thing I was most worried about, because when you have close up shots of a Lego minifig crying, is that going to be emotional? I didn't know.",
      "But there were a few animators on our team who were really good at facial animation, and we gave them the most emotional scenes, the close-up scenes. And oftentimes, if something wasn't quite right, we would send them videos.",
      "Somewhere in the world, there are a whole lot of clips me and Pharrell making very strange faces!",
      "The arc of the film is Pharrell re-discovering his muse after a period where he gets lost, creatively. Why did you focus on that aspect of his story?",
      "Without a doubt, the film reflects a lot of questions I've had about my own career.",
      "To me, the story about this black nerd from the projects of Virginia who sees the world differently... and it makes him an outcast for a long time. Then he finds a fellow outcast in Chad Hugo [Williams' co-writer in The Neptunes] and they start making music.",
      "But their beats were just too weird for people. The signature Neptunes sound was very unorthodox. Nobody got it until everybody got it. Then you end up in this hall of mirrors \u2013 where the thing that makes you different becomes the sound of the mainstream. When that happens, how do you stay true to yourself?",
      "Your film comes out at the same time as the Robbie Williams biopic Better Man, where he's played by a CGI monkey. Do you think music biopics had become too formulaic?",
      "I do. There's so many tropes of music films, and I think we need to do more to help people identify with the people and with their characters.",
      "I haven\u2019t seen Better Man yet but the idea's perfect because, in a way, Robbie Williams is the performing monkey. He wants the attention. He's always lived that life.",
      "And Pharrell is the Wizard of Oz. He's like, \"I want to be the guy behind the curtain.\""

      "But this year, there was one sound that students were especially scared of: \"APT\".",
      "The global hit by Blackpink's Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars emerged as a \"forbidden\" song among students who feared that its catchiness could cause them to lose focus during the test.",
      "No distractions are too minor when it comes to the Suneung, which many see as a culmination of years of formal education - and a turning point that determines their university placements, careers, and social statuses.",
      "\"I\u2019m worried that the song will play in my head even during the exam,\" one student told Yonhap News of the chart-topper. \"Adults might laugh and say, 'Why stress over something like that?' But for us, with such an important test ahead, it can feel unsettling.\"",
      "Suneung students have previously been encouraged to avoid other so-called earworms, with songs such as \"Go Go\" by BTS and \"Ring Ding Dong\" by SHINee repeatedly cited online as tracks that should be forbidden.",
      "Ensuring that the exam runs smoothly is a nationwide effort. Shops and the stock market opened late on Thursday to reduce traffic congestion, and authorities adjusted public transport operating hours and put more than a dozen spare trains on standby in case of breakdowns.",
      "More than 10,000 police officers were deployed, including some tasked to ferry students to school during emergencies.",
      "Besides grounding planes to minimise noise disturbances during the 20-minute English listening test, authorities have also asked bus and taxi drivers to refrain from honking while the tests are taking place.",
      "Disruptions to the Suneung are treated as a serious matter. Last December, dozens of students sued the government after teachers accidentally cut their test short by 90 seconds.",
      "There are a record number of candidates retaking the exam this year, after authorities announced they would expand enrolment in medical schools - a move that was met with widespread protests among trainee doctors while being welcomed by aspiring medical students."

      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",
      "This year, Glastonbury tickets cost \u00a3375.50 each plus a \u00a35 booking fee - but at the check-out you will only pay a deposit of \u00a375, with the balance due in the first week of April. (Children aged 12 and under go free, and do not need to be registered.)",
      "Make sure you have enough money in your account (\u00a3450 if you're buying for six people) and, crucially, keep your card details to hand.",
      "When the time comes, enter these details exactly as you see them because a mistake could result in the purchase being declined. In some cases, that could leave your registration details being frozen for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Finally, make sure your phone is charged and notifications aren't silenced, in case your bank contacts you for verification.",
      "9) Check your email",
      "Once you've made the booking, be sure to check your email for confirmation - including the junk folder.",
      "If you don't receive an email within three hours, ticket-holders are urged to contact See Tickets on their customer service portal.",
      "10) Don't despair",
      "If you're not one of the lucky ones, there's still hope.",
      "It's possible to get into the festival as a volunteer - typically working three eight-hour shifts in return for a ticket.",
      "And in April, a number of returned or unwanted tickets will be put up for sale. At which point, you can go through the stress of applying all over again.",
      "11) Indulge in wild speculation about the line-up",
      "This won't help you get tickets, but is an essential part of the annual routine.",
      "Nobody except Emily Eavis knows who'll be headlining next year - but rumours are rumours, and everybody enjoys speculating about the line-up.",
      "Oasis, whose reunion tour takes place next summer, have already ruled themselves out. But current contenders for the top slots include Sam Fender, who put on an incredible Pyramid Stage performance two years ago; and Olivia Rodrigo, who's already headlining the BST Festival in London on Glastonbury weekend.",
      "Eminem and Rihanna are among the perennial will-they/won't-they headliners, while Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder are supposedly in the running for the legend slot.",
      "In previous years, piecemeal confirmation of the line-up has started in November, but the full rundown is typically kept under wraps until March.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",

      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

      "Gareth, from Cardiff, has been a fan of Sleep Token for five years and is excited to see them.",
      "He feels the group \"have moments of real sombreness\" mixed with the heavy metal.",
      "\"I guess when they started, they were supporting the headliners [at the time],\" Gareth, 22, says.",

      "A familiar face to football fans, Mark 'Chappers' Chapman is considered by many to be a front-runner with his warm presenting style.",
      "He brings a wealth of experience, having regularly stood in to present Match of the Day and fronted its sister programme, Match of the Day 2, for over a decade.",
      "Chapman has also recently begun hosting the BBC's new mid-week Champions League highlights show, secured under a three-year deal with Uefa.",

      "Gabby Logan is one of the UK's most well-known sports presenters, with 20 years' experience hosting major football coverage across various networks.",
      "After starting her broadcasting career at Sky, she moved to ITV, deputising for Des Lynam on The Premiership, the channel's highlights show launched after they won the rights from the BBC between 2001 and 2004.",

      "The former England and Arsenal midfielder became the first female analyst to be taken to a men's World Cup by the BBC when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018.",
      "Later that summer, she also debuted as Sky Sports' first woman football pundit.",
      "In 2021, she took over hosting duties for the BBC's Football Focus - replacing the departing Dan Walker on the weekend preview show.",
      "An ever-present broadcaster at men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments since, Scott wore a rainbow armband during England\u2019s first match of the Qatar World Cup - showing support for the LGBT community in a country where homosexuality remains illegal.",
      "The recipient of an MBE, she defended her London accent after ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones criticised her pronunciation.",
      "Kate Scott",
      "Following a stint at TNT Sport, Kate Scott has found her career transformed at the helm of CBS' Champions League coverage.",
      "She previously told GQ that the show's success relies on its uninhibited feel, calling it the \"locker room environment translated onto television\" - mirroring the personality-driven tone younger audiences are used to from online sports content.",
      "One of its pundits, Micah Richards (see below), has separately described Scott as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel.",
      "As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot.",
      "There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Scott want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?",
      "Alan Shearer",
      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",
      "The Northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2.",
      "But Murray chose to leave that role in 2013, as he had an offer to join TalkSport radio. He has continued to work at the BBC however, presenting  various shows on 5 Live, along with becoming host of Channel 4's long-running word show, Countdown.",
      "Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",
      "She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year.",
      "Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros.",
      "Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.",
      "Woods fits the mould of Scott and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.",
      "Jake Humphrey",
      "Humphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits.",
      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",
      "An experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish.",
      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",
      "Correction 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",

      "Folic acid is to be added to non-wholemeal wheat flour in the UK to help prevent birth defects.",
      "Adding folic acid to flour could prevent around 200 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, every year, and improve the health of pregnant women, says the government, which is giving manufacturers until the end of 2026 to conform to the new legal requirement.",
      "Expectant mothers and women trying to conceive should continue to take supplementary folic acid -  the synthetic version of the vitamin folate - as currently advised by medical practioners.",
      "Folic acid is particularly important in early pregnancy, aiding proper development of the baby's brain, skull and spinal cord.",
      "Experts, many of whom have called for the move for a number of years, have welcomed the government's decision.",

      "Some say the change doesn't go far enough, however, and more foods should be included.",
      "Prof Neena Modi, professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London, said: \"This will disadvantage groups such as women who are sensitive to gluten, eat rice in preference to bread, and products made from wholemeal flour - excluding them and their babies from benefiting, and thus adding to the considerable health inequities that already exist in the UK.\"",
      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",
      "In addition, the NHS recommends women who are trying for a baby take folic acid supplements for approximately three months before getting pregnant, and for at least 12 weeks after becoming pregnant. This recommendation will remain in place.",
      "It is estimated that half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned. The fortification of flour will therefore help boost intake of folic acid across the population, and, indirectly, better protect unborn babies.",

      "The case for and against is constantly reviewed in the UK, with the most recent report from the National Screening Committee, in 2020, saying the harms were too great.",

      "Despite more men dying from prostate cancer than women from breast cancer, there is no reliable test for the disease.",

      "Screening means aggressive cancers can be treated before symptoms appear.",
      "But trials show there are harms to testing large numbers of healthy men - and once a cancer is spotted, even a low-risk one, it needs to be followed up.",
      "Many men with a low-risk cancer are simply monitored or begin \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d - but a cancer diagnosis and the invasive tests it involves have a psychological impact.",
      "One in 10 of these men opts for radical surgery rather than live with the anxiety of wondering whether their cancer will grow, Prof Ahmed says.",
      "But this can leave them unable to maintain an erection - and a third spend the rest of their life needing a pad because they leak urine.",
      "\u201cAt the age of 47-48, if we're talking about testing and diagnosing men at that age, that's two or three decades of those kinds of symptoms,\" Prof Ahmed told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme.",
      "\"So I would rather avoid finding low-risk disease.\u201d",
      "Much research in the field has focused on refining the process to minimise the harms of screening.",
      "And Prof Ahmed is running the Transform trial, starting next year, to compare the most promising technologies.",

      "In the meantime, Prostate Cancer Research's report says, screening 45-69-year-olds at high risk - black men and those with a family history of the disease or particular gene mutations - would deliver an economic benefit, after factoring in the cost of treatment and the impact on working lives and carers.",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "Reeves told the BBC that UK public sector pension funds in their current form were not big enough to generate good returns for British savers, but some argue the changes are not without risk.",
      "What will it mean for my pension?",
      "Workers in local government schemes have a pension based on salary and service length - known as a defined benefit pension - and they will not see any change to their payments as a result of the plans.",
      "Most private sector workers are in schemes where they pay into a savings pot each month, and their eventual pension depends upon the size of this when they retire.",
      "The government is considering setting a minimum size requirement for these defined contributions schemes. It is hoped that larger funds will be more efficient to run and generate greater returns, which could mean people's pension savings grow faster.",
      "Will Rachel Reeves' public sector pension plans work?",

      "A bid by the department for rural affairs to soften changes to inheritance tax for farms - possibly by exempting some older farmers - has been rejected by the Treasury.",
      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",

      "The move has been branded \"disastrous\" by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), with some farmers warning it would decimate the countryside.",
      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",

      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",

      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",

      "Mr Bailey, who farms in Staffordshire, said the suggested exemption should cover people much younger than 80.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not special, but the economic circumstances of farming are very different to other industries.\"",
      "'The policy will not change'",

      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",

    "story": [
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has ordered officials to look at the costs for the NHS of implementing any changes in the law on assisted dying.",
      "Streeting, who plans to vote against a new assisted dying bill when it is debated later this month, has suggested what is proposed could lead to cuts in other NHS services.",
      "The bill, published on Monday, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their life if two doctors and a High Court judge verify they are eligible and have made their decision voluntarily.",
      "The policy would have \"resource implications\" which would \"come at the expense of other choices\", Streeting told Times Radio.",

      "Assisted dying could stop harrowing deaths, says MP behind bill",
      "'I might be dead before a decision is made': Terminally-ill people on assisted dying",
      "Speaking to the NHS Providers conference in Liverpool, Streeting said: \"I've asked my department to look at the costs that would be associated with providing a new service to enable assisted dying to go forward.\"",
      "The department said it had not begun a formal review, but assessing the impact of potential new legislation was \u201cregular policy work\u201d.",
      "Streeting also said he was worried about a \"chilling slippery slope argument\" if people felt compelled to end their own lives as a cost-saving measure.",
      "But he added: \"Regardless of my own personal position or my own vote, my department and the whole government will respect the will of Parliament if people vote for assisted dying.\"",
      "'Implications'",
      "Streeting had earlier warned that financing assisted dying would come at the expense of other NHS services.",
      "Asked by Times Radio whether he would have to find money from elsewhere if the bill became law, Streeting said: \"Yep, to govern is to choose.",
      "\"If Parliament chooses to go ahead with assisted dying, it is making a choice that this is an area to prioritise for investment. And we'd have to work through those implications.\"",
      "He said the health service would \"need to work through with the medical profession what would be a very new way of working\".",
      "\"No one should be compelled, for example, to take part in assisted dying if they have got moral or ethical objections as clinicians. That certainly would be one of my red lines\".",
      "Streeting has repeatedly expressed his view that the palliative care system is not \"where it needs to be to give people a real choice\".",
      "Downing Street declined to confirm if he was right about assisted dying costs impacting NHS services.",
      "The prime minister's spokesperson said it was \"a matter for Parliament to decide\" after debating \"the issues surrounding the Bill\".",
      "Free vote",
      "The assisted dying bill has been introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who argues her legislation is the \"most robust\" in the world. She has said she expects hundreds of dying people to apply if it is available.",
      "Critics of her measure have raised fears of coercion and a slippery slope to wider legislation taking in more people.",
      "Speaking on Tuesday, Leadbeater rejected these claims, saying her bill had \u201cthree layers of scrutiny,\u201d requiring sign-offs from two doctors and a High Court judge, and made coercion punishable by up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Only terminally-ill adults with less than six months to live who have a settled wish to end their lives would be eligible under the new law.",
      "MPs are scheduled to debate and vote on the bill on 29 November.",
      "The prime minister, a former director of public prosecutions, has previously supported assisted dying, but the government has pledged to remain neutral on the issue, and MPs are being allowed to vote according to their conscience rather than along party lines.",
      "This will be the first Commons vote on assisted dying since MPs rejected allowing terminally ill adults to end their lives under medical supervision in 2015. As a backbench Labour MP, Streeting voted in favour of that measure.",
      "If the bill passes its first vote later this month, it will receive further scrutiny from MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it."

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced fresh climate change targets at a global summit, saying he wants the UK to lead on cutting emissions.",
      "The UK will now aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035, he told the UN conference of parties (COP29) in Azerbaijan.",
      "The target updates a 78% pledge by 2035 under the previous Conservative government, although that also included international aviation and shipping emissions, and goes beyond another pledge of a 68% reduction by 2030.",

      "Climate talks open in shadow of Trump victory",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "The prime minister said the new target was based on recommendations from the UK's independent climate change committee (CCC) aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to levels in 1990.",
      "He was one of only seven G20 leaders attending the summit, with 13 absentees including the premiers of the US, China, France and Germany.",
      "Sir Keir would not be drawn on his views about president-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to cut climate rules during his election campaign.",
      "He said: \"Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game\".",
      "The target will be included in papers to go before Parliament before February and, although Sir Keir did not announce any new policies, he did commit to continuing to provide \u00a311.6bn of climate finance until March 2026, a pledge made under the previous government.",
      "Announcing a \u00a31bn investment in a wind turbine project in Hull, which he said would create 1,300 local jobs, Sir Keir said the world was standing at a \"critical juncture in the climate crisis\".",
      "The UK has called for other countries to match the new target, following stark warnings from the United Nations that the world is on course for a 3.1C rise without further cuts.",
      "The latest target is broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050, contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
      "That international agreement ties the UK to ratcheting up new \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) for carbon reduction every five years, which has seen the a 68% cut by 2030 increase to an 81% cut by 2035.",
      "The Climate Change Act 2008 also set legally-binding domestic agreements on carbon budgets in five year chunks until 2050, which unlike the NDC targets also include international aviation and shipping emissions.",

      "The government advisers said taxes on meat and dairy might be needed if people do not voluntarily reduce their consumption of the products, and there should be moves to phase out the use of petrol cars.",

      "In response, energy minister Kerry McCarthy said: \"It's really important that we are stepping up and showing global ambition.",
      "\"Reaching net zero in this country and getting to clean power by 2030 is a massive opportunity - it is not a cost.\"",
      "The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, welcomed the new target and said it was feasible based on the latest science, technological developments, and the UK\u2019s national circumstances.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that this is a feasible target that will support jobs and investment,\" he said, adding the UK was currently running behind schedule on delivering its 2030 target of 68% cuts.",

    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to government data.",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions.

      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",

      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:08:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",

      "Which? said the firm would be paid fees as the case progressed, getting additional payments if it was successful - but they would not be getting a percentage of any damages.",
      "Alan Davis, from law firm Pinsent Masons, said there were very likely to be more, similar cases in the future.",
      "\"It is inevitable that further claims of this nature will continue to be brought given the very high value of the aggregate damages and the role of and incentive for litigation funders to support these claims which might not otherwise be brought without that financial support,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs.",
      "Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.",
      "Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.",
      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",

      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:46:38 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study finds that caste plays a vital role in high rates of stunting in children in India.",
    "story": [
      "Decades of caste discrimination have contributed to India having higher levels of child stunting rates than across Sub-Saharan Africa, new research has revealed.",
      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

      "About 1.9 million people - 90% of Gaza\u2019s population - have fled their homes over the past year, and 79% of the territory is under Israeli-issued evacuation orders, according to the UN.",

      "Israel said the report was \"completely false and detached from reality\".",

      "He added that Israel would \"continue to operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict\".",
      "HRW has also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields by operating inside homes and civilian infrastructure.",
      "The report was published as Israeli forces continued a ground offensive in northern Gaza that has displaced up to 130,000 people over the past five weeks.",
      "The UN has said 75,000 people remain under siege with dwindling supplies of water and food in the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, where the Israeli military says it is preventing a Hamas resurgence.",

      "The US-based group says the Israeli evacuation orders have been \u201cinconsistent, inaccurate, and frequently not communicated to civilians with enough time\u201d, and that they \u201cdid not consider the needs of people with disabilities and others who are unable to leave\u201d. Israeli forces have also \u201crepeatedly struck designated evacuation routes and safe zones\u201d, it adds.",
      "It accuses Israeli authorities of blocking \u201call but a small fraction of the necessary humanitarian aid, water, electricity, and fuel from reaching civilians in need\u201d, as well as carrying out attacks that have damaged and destroyed vital resources like hospitals and bakeries.",

      "\u201cForced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity,\u201d HRW says.",
      "It also says that the \u201corganised, violent displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, who are members of another ethnic group, is likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors\u201d, and that such actions \u201camount to ethnic cleansing\u201d.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:57:52 GMT",
    "summary": "John Smyth, a known child abuser in the UK, went to Zimbabwe and set up Christian holiday camps.",
    "story": [
      "The sister of a 16-year-old boy who drowned while swimming naked at a Christian holiday camp in Zimbabwe run by child abuser John Smyth blames the Church of England for his death.",
      "\"The Church knew about the abuses that John Smyth was doing. They should have stopped him. Had they stopped him, I think my brother [Guide Nyachuru] would still be alive,\" Edith Nyachuru told the BBC.",
      "The British barrister had moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984 to work with an evangelistic organisation.",
      "This was two years after an investigation revealed he had subjected boys in the UK, many of whom he had met at Christian holiday camps run by a charity he chaired that was linked to the Church, to traumatic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "The 1982 report, prepared by Anglican clergyman Mark Ruston, about the canings said \"the scale and severity of the practice was horrific\", with accounts of boys beaten so badly they bled, with one describing how he needed to wear nappies until his wounds scabbed over.",
      "Despite these shocking revelations, mainly involving boys from elite British public schools, the Ruston report was not widely circulated.",
      "A decade on, aged 50, Smyth had established himself as a respected member of the Christian community in Zimbabwe. He had set up his own organisation, Zambesi Ministries, with funding from the UK - and was meting out similar punishments at camps that he marketed at the country\u2019s top schools.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says her brother\u2019s trip had been an early Christmas present from one of his other sisters, who had picked up one of Smyth\u2019s brochures and been impressed with all the activities on offer for the week.",
      "As she looks at an old photograph of Guide, she says he was the youngest of seven siblings, and the only boy: \"He was very loved by everyone.",
      "\"A lovely boy... Guide was due to be made head boy the following year,\" she remembers, adding that he was \"an intelligent boy, a good swimmer, strong, healthy with no known medical conditions\".",
      "But within 12 hours of him being dropped at the camp at Ruzawi School in Marondera, 74km (46 miles) from the capital, Harare, on the evening of 15 December 1992, the family received a call to say he had died.",
      "Witnesses say that like all the boys, Guide had gone swimming naked in a pool before bed - a camp tradition. The other boys returned to the dormitory, but Guide\u2019s absence was not noticed - which his sister finds surprising - and his body was found at the bottom of the pool the next morning.",
      "His family rushed to the mortuary but Ms Nyachuru\u2019s shock was compounded by confusion when she was stopped by officers from viewing his body: \"They told me: 'You can\u2019t go in there because he is indecently dressed.'",
      "\"It was only my father, my brother-in-law and our pastor who went in and put him in the coffin.\"",
      "Nakedness appears to be something Smyth was fixated on at his camps. Camp attendees have told of how he would often parade around without clothes in the boys\u2019 dormitories - where he also slept, unlike other staff members.",
      "He would also shower naked with them in the communal showers and the boys were ordered not to wear underpants in bed.",
      "\"He promoted nakedness and encouraged the boys to walk around naked at the summer camp,\" a former student who attended a camp at Ruzawi in 1991 told the BBC.",
      "But his jocular manner put many of them at ease, he said.",
      "\"Smyth was very friendly, laid-back, approachable, he was really fun, always joking.",
      "\"Smyth would also walk the dorms and shower area wearing nothing but a towel slung over his shoulder.\"",
      "The reason given for the no-underwear-in-the-evening rule was \"because it would make them grow\", he recalled.",
      "Smyth gave talks on masturbation, would sometimes lead prayers in the nude and encouraged naked trampolining, an activity he described as \"flappy jumping\" - all behaviour noted in an investigation by Zimbabwean lawyer David Coltart that was launched in May 1993.",
      "It was the thrashings that Smyth was giving boys with a notorious table tennis bat, dubbed \"TTB\", that led a parent to the door of Coltart, who worked at a law practice in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo.",
      "She wanted to know why one of her sons had returned from a holiday camp with bruises on his buttocks so severe that she took him to a doctor, who found a \"12cm x 12cm bruise\".",
      "\"She saw these and demanded to know what happened and then it came out that her son had been badly beaten in the nude, and she came to me for advice,\" Coltart, now mayor of Bulawayo, told the BBC.",
      "\"When I heard that this was a Christian organisation - I\u2019m an elder in the Presbyterian Church - I got hold of my pastor and we got hold of the Baptist Church, Methodist Church and two other churches in the city and then I was instructed by those churches to investigate the matter,\" he said.",
      "Forty-four-year-old Jason Leanders, who went on the camp that immediately followed Guide\u2019s death, said he was beaten three to four times a day by Smyth, who would put his hands into his pants to check he had not put on extra layers to cushion his buttocks.",
      "\"My bum was black,\" he told the BBC. \"But being a boy, you act tough.\"",
      "For many boarding school students, corporal punishment was regarded as \"normal\", former Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga, who was attending the camp the night Guide died, said in his 2015 autobiography.",
      "But after Coltart managed to track down the Ruston report, the severity of the problem became apparent. He wrote to Smyth instructing him to immediately stop the Zambesi Ministries camps.",
      "\"It was calculated, he focused on boys. He groomed young men. He encouraged them to take showers in the nude with him. There was a pattern of violence,\" he said.",
      "But Coltart\u2019s dealings with Smyth proved difficult.",
      "\"He was a highly articulate man and quite aggressive in the meetings that I had with him. He employed all his skills as a barrister to seek to intimidate. He was older than me. I was then a relatively young lawyer in my 30s. He exploited the fact that he was an English QC [Queen's Counsel].\"",
      "Rather than comply with Coltart\u2019s various requests, he doubled down and in a letter to parents ahead of the August 1993 camps, described himself as \"a father figure to the camp\" and defended the nudity and corporal punishment, writing: \"I never cane the boys, but I do whack with a table tennis bat when necessary\u2026 although most regard TTB (as it is affectionately known) as little more than a joke.\"",
      "This time there appears to have been no cloaking of the beatings as \"spiritual discipline\" as had been the case in the UK. He also admitted to Coltart that he took photographs of naked boys, but said they were \"from shoulders up\" for publicity purposes.",
      "Coltart contacted two psychologists with his findings, both of whom advised that Smyth should stop working with children.",
      "His 21-page report was then published in October 1993, and circulated to head teachers and church leaders in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"The report was never published widely, conscious of the dangers of a defamation suit,\" Coltart said.",
      "However it \"basically stopped him in his tracks in Zimbabwe\" as the private schools were his harvesting ground, he said. Zambesi Ministries camps did continue in some guise, but not at schools or under Smyth\u2019s leadership",
      "Coltart then instructed another law firm to pursue a legal case against Smyth who was eventually charged with culpable homicide over Guide\u2019s death, as well as charges relating to the beatings.",
      "But, according to former BBC TV producer Andrew Graystone in his 2021 book about the abuse, the case was bedevilled with problems, police documents were missing and Smyth\u2019s legal prowess led to the prosecutor being removed - another one was never appointed, so the case was essentially shelved in 1997.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says no post-mortem was carried out at the time - Guide was buried on the day he drowned in the family's home village, with Smyth presiding over the funeral.",
      "Following the Coltart report, Smyth faced deportation from Zimbabwe but Graystone says he used his significant connections to avoid this, lobbying various cabinet ministers - some of whose sons had attended his camps - with suggestions that even then-President Robert Mugabe was approached by one of Smyth\u2019s associates.",
      "But from the time of Smyth\u2019s prosecution, the family were given temporary residency permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days.",
      "In 2001, having spent too long out of the country on a trip, Smyth and his wife Anne were refused re-entry, prompting their move to South Africa\u2019s coastal city of Durban and then a few years later to Cape Town, where the couple were living when the Church of England became fully aware in 2013 of the abuses he had committed in the UK.",
      "\"The Anglican church in Cape Town in which John Smyth worshipped\u2026 has reported that it never received any reports suggesting he abused or groomed young people,\" Thabo Makgoba, the archbishop of Cape Town, said in statement responding to this week's resignation of Justin Welby as Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Smyth was only excommunicated by his local church the year before his death in 2018, after he was named publicly as an abuser in a Channel 4 News report.",
      "Ms Nyachuru told the BBC it was not until 2021 that she received a written apology from Welby about the death of her brother, in which he admitted that Smyth was responsible and the church had failed her family.",
      "She wrote back describing the apology as \"too little, too late\" and is now calling for other senior church leaders who failed to intervene to prevent Smyth's abuse to resign: \"I just think people of the church, if they see something not going in the right direction, if it needs the police they should go to the police.\"",
      "Coltart feels it is not just the Church that is to blame, and suggests other institutions in the UK need to face up to their failure to warn people in Zimbabwe.",
      "He commended the Church of England\u2019s recent Makin report, saying it \"left no stone unturned\". The report estimates that around \"85 boys and young men were physically abused in African countries, including Zimbabwe\".",
      "Coltart urged the Church to reach out to them.",
      "\"I think possibly there are still victims in Zimbabwe, perhaps in South Africa, who are suffering from PTSD and I think the Anglican church has a responsibility to identify those individuals and to supply them with the medical assistance that they might require,\" he said.",
      "Mr Leanders says many of his friends are still \"so traumatised by the beatings they are not even prepared to talk about it\".",
      "\"Smyth was protected in England and he was protected in Zimbabwe. The protection went on for so long it robbed victims the chance to confront Smyth as adults.\"",

      "The Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015, outlines a long-term plan to rein in rising temperatures, as countries strive to keep that rise under 1.5C this century.",
      "They have also agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and to treble renewable power by 2030.",
      "But while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis.",
      "\"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories. They include former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon, former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and former president of Ireland Mary Robinson.",

      "\u201cWe're not a part of those discussions,\u201d said Micahi Robertson who\u2019s an adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States at these talks.",
      "The letter has been prompted by growing concerns about some of the countries chosen to host COP talks and their ability to deliver a significant advance in the fight against rising temperatures.",
      "Just before the latest conference started, a secret recording showed the chief executive of Azerbaijan's COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, discussing \"investment opportunities\" in the state oil and gas company with a man posing as a potential investor.",

      "President Aliyev also hit out at France for carrying out colonialist \u201ccrimes\u201d and \u201chuman rights violations\u201d in overseas territories.",
      "Such strongly expressed views are extremely rare from the leader of a COP host, where the aim is to build consensus on how to tackle rising temperatures.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",

      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",

But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",

On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to \u201ca consistent and loyal friend\", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote \"Mike Huckabee\" with heart emojis.",

      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",
      "Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump\u2019s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September.",
      "It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump\u2019s dealings with Israel.",
      "In July, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership was good for Israel and the entire region\u201d.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",
      "He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians.",
      "Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote.",

But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",

      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "The process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",

      "Immigration and the border",
      "Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Sunday \"we know he promised to sign an executive order to secure the southern border\".",
      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.",
      "In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early.",
      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.",
      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",
      "He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "What Trump's got wrong on birthright law",
      "6 January",
      "Trump did not mention pardons in his victory speech, but he has long suggested that pardoning those convicted of storming the Capitol in 2021 would be a priority.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Jack Smith",
      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump and his supporters will still try to punish Mr Smith. Congressional Republicans have reportedly implied they intend to investigate his work.",
      "\"Jack Smith\u2019s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished\", billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk posted on social media.",
      "Trump had said firing Jack Smith is one of his top priorities.",
      "\"I would fire him within two seconds. He\u2019ll be one of the first things addressed,\" he said in an interview in October.",
      "Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a \"crooked person\", a \"scoundrel\" and other insults.",
      "Smith's cases were already facing an uncertain future. The Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have partial immunity from criminal prosecution for their conduct in office, undermining Mr Smith's work.",
      "Trump's electoral win also gives him the power to pardon himself of any federal crimes, though no president has done so before.",
      "'Man of his word': Jan 6 rioters expect Trump will keep pardon promise",
      "What happens to Trump\u2019s convictions and legal cases after election win?",
      "Paris climate agreement",
      "In his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal.",
      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.",
      "How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January.",
      "Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions.",
      "Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - \"We\u2019re drilling, drilling, drilling,\" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year.",
      "Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.",
      "Russia and Ukraine",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.",
      "He has not yet given specifics on how he would negotiate the war's end beyond saying he would help the two countries strike a deal.",
      "Since his re-election, Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call that lasted \"about half an hour\", with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part. A source told the BBC that \"it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things\".",
      "The Kremlin denied that Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, though media reports said Trump warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trade and economy",
      "The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office.",
      "\u201cWe will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\u201d Trump has said.",
      "\u201cI will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.\u201d",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to \u201cuse every tool and authority at their disposal\u201d to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.",
      "He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,\u201d he has said.",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.",
      "Another promise is to \u201cend the Biden-Harris war on American energy\u201d, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.",
      "Title X",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country\u2019s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump\u2019s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.",
      "Now, it\u2019s expected that Trump will change the rules again.",

    "summary": "The tech billionaire joins the incoming administration to \"dismantle government bureaucracy\" - but what's in it for both of them?",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has been tasked with leading incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "In a statement on social media, the US president-elect said Musk - along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy - would \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies\".",
      "It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for.",
      "But it is also one that is expected to garner him influence over government policy - and the regulatory environment facing his enterprises.",

      "Tesla, crypto and jails among trade winners",
      "What top team picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "Will Trump be sentenced over hush money case?",
      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

      "Some of Trump\u2019s newly revealed appointments suggest that the president-elect\u2019s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants living in the US is no exaggeration.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been Trump\u2019s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump\u2019s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.  He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",
      "Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump\u2019s first term, supported the president\u2019s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he\u2019s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump\u2019s \u201cimmigration tsar\u201d.",
      "\u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\u201d Homan said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue.",
      "\u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no price tag.\u201d",

      "China hawks take flight",
      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",
      "In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of \u201cblatant and malicious election interference\u201d amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president\u2019s phones.",
      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",
      "US-China relations were often rocky during Trump's first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump's China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters.

      "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.",

      "Musk\u2019s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group\u2019s efforts to advance the president-elect\u2019s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections.",
      "Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America \u201chealthy\u201d again.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do some things, and we\u2019re going to let him go to it,\u201d Trump said in his election victory speech.",
      "Prioritising presidential power over Congress",
      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.",
      "The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw.",
      "And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",

      "Hegseth, 44, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, will be responsible for the world's most powerful military in his first political role.",
      "Announcing his choice on Tuesday, Trump described him as \"tough, smart and a true believer in America First\".",
      "The news came on the same day Trump announced another political newcomer, billionaire Elon Musk, would take a government cost-cutting role.",
      "Trump's administration is taking shape after his win in last week's presidential election. Hegseth was one of a flurry of security appointments that also included Trump's pick of John Ratcliffe to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).",
      "If confirmed for his role by the US Senate, Hegseth will arrive at the Pentagon with decisions to make on issues such as military assistance for Israel during its campaign in Gaza, and on support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.",

      "Republicans have won back control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and are inching towards a majority in the House, the lower chamber, as vote-counting continues.",
      "Some of the government appointments - including Hegseth's - require a vote of approval by senators, although Trump, also a Republican, has demanded that the next leader of the US Senate let him bypass this process. He can give out other jobs directly.",

      "He is reported by US media to have successfully lobbied Trump during his first presidency to pardon servicemen accused of war crimes.",
      "In his statement announcing Hegseth as his pick for defence secretary on Tuesday, Trump highlighted the former soldier's education at Princeton and Harvard universities, and his military experience in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
      "\"With Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice - our military will be great again, and America will never back down,\" Trump wrote in a post.",
      "The president-elect also drew attention to Hegseth's work as a published author. He said the book The War on Warrior \"reveals the leftwing betrayal of our warriors, and how we must return our military to meritocracy, lethality, accountability, and excellence\".",
      "What has he previously said about the military?",
      "Hegseth has been an outspoken opponent of what he has referred to as \"woke\" policies within the US military and its leadership.",
      "\"The dumbest phrase on planet earth in the military is our diversity is our strength,\" Hegseth said on a podcast this month.",
      "One of his tasks as defence secretary could be to act on Trump's campaign promises to get rid of US generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies in the force.",
      "Before his selection by Trump, Hegseth was asked on the same podcast about what changes he would make in the military. He referred to \"first of all\" firing the US' top military officer, Gen Charles \"CQ\" Brown Jr, saying people involved in diversity, equality or inclusion policies had \"got to go\".",
      "\"Either you're in for war fighting and that's it, that's the only litmus test we care about,\" Hegseth told the Shawn Ryan Show, in an episode released last week.",

      "What has the reaction been?",
      "Hegseth's pick has been welcomed by a number of prominent Republican figures, but other reactions have been more varied.",
      "North Carolina senator Thom Tillis told Associated Press the choice was \"interesting\", and Senator Tommy Tuberville, of Alabama, said he would \"have to think\" about what he thought of the appointment.",
      "Incoming national security advisor Waltz said Hegseth \"has the grit\" to make \"real reform\" happen at the Pentagon. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said the job \"should not be an entry-level position\".",
      "Posting on X, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said the appointment of Hegseth as defence secretary would \"make us less safe and must be rejected\".",

      "\u201cA pardon will be life changing,\u201d said Evans, who was a member of the West Virginia legislature when he and at least 2,000 others stormed Congress. It was part of an effort to overturn the results of the US election, inspired by the false belief that it was Trump, not President Joe Biden, who had won.",
      "He reached an agreement with prosecutors which saw him plead guilty to civil disorder and spent three months in federal prison in 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would pardon the rioters, whom he has called \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d. But who exactly might be pardoned - and when - is still an open question.",

      "Some of those who have been given the longest sentences, such as Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, did not participate in the violence inside the building. Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee.",
      "Arrests are still being made. In an update issued last week, the FBI said it is still looking for nine suspects wanted for violent assaults on police officers.",

      "Jonathanpeter Klein, who along with his brother Matthew pleaded guilty to several charges in July, asked for his sentencing hearing, scheduled for 15 November, to be delayed. That request, too, was turned down.",
      "A lawyer for Joe Biggs, a member of the Proud Boys who was handed one of the longest riot-related sentences, told reporters that he would be asking Trump for a pardon.",
      "Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2023 after being convicted of crimes including seditious conspiracy, intimidation or threats to prevent officials from discharging their duties, and interference with law enforcement during civil disorder.",
      "During the riot, Biggs and others led a group of Proud Boys, tearing through barriers and barging into the Senate chamber.",
      "At trial, Biggs and others argued they were merely following Trump\u2019s orders. His lawyer, Norman Pattis, told reporters in Florida that he would be seeking a pardon from the Trump administration.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:01:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Makers of a new generation of European electric aircraft are struggling to raise money.",
    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",
      "\"No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,\" laughs Mr Fehrm.",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",
      "In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version.",
      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",
      "\u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving.",
      "Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts.",
      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",
      "\u201cFrench needs it, because as every English student of French knows, there is no word for \u2018shallow\u2019,\u201d he said.  Sadly, he failed.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",

But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",

      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",

The duo had eight Top 20 hits in the 1960s and '70s, and their TV series, \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" was a ratings bonanza.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",
      "Pressing my mouth to her ear so that she could hear, I cupped my hand over it and yelled, \"Mom, can we stand on our seats and scream, too?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied, grinning like a teenager and taking off her high heels. \"Come on, let's do it!\" So we did, straining on our tip-toes to see him.",
      "Glowing with happiness, I tried to work out if Elvis would be too old to marry me by the time I was grown, so that he could sing to me every day. Dreaming of being Mrs. Presley, I couldn't stop talking to Mom about Elvis for weeks as I floated around on a gold lam\u00e9 cloud.",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",

And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, speaking at an event hosted by the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., this week,\u00a0ahead of Trump's decision.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under Trump. Instead, Kennedy has promised to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding.",
      "Marks flatly rebuked Kennedy's claims about the safety data.",
      "\"There's no secret files. I mean, if they're secret, I hold a security clearance. If they are secret from me then, they must be at some other level of classification,\" he said.",

      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that has often clashed with the FDA, likened the pick to \"putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA.\"",
      "Marks, a career civil servant who played a key role in launching the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, says he has \"sat in the room\" across from Kennedy when vaccines were discussed multiple times.",
      "While he said he worries that spending time \"re-litigating things that we know work\" could undermine other important FDA efforts \u2014 and could be potentially deadly during a future pandemic if it further erodes confidence in vaccines \u2014 Marks also said that working with RFK Jr. could turn out to have a silver lining.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" he said.",
      "Marks rejected Kennedy's claims that the FDA is filled with corrupt officials who need to be fired, stressing that the staff is dedicated to protecting Americans' health. Marks said he hopes to keep his job under Trump and Kennedy, and to protect the team at his center.",
      "\"They do what they do to protect the American people. Not for any kind of nefarious purpose. And during the COVID pandemic, people worked 14 hours a day,\" Marks said of the agency's staff.",
      "Kennedy has vowed to end what he calls the agency's \"war on public health,\" warning workers who are \"part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "He has also specifically pledged to fire all of the nutritional scientists at the FDA and other agencies on his first day, accusing them of being co-opted by corporate interests.",
      "\"I look forward to working with the more than 80,000 employees at HHS to free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth,\" Kennedy posted Thursday on X.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's scientific expertise, Marks said he thought Kennedy's understanding is \"not as deep as others,\" but added, \"I know a number of attorneys who know more than most PhDs and MDs about medicine. So it's not the degree. It's just a matter of keeping an open mind.\"",
      "While Kennedy's pick for the role was just announced on Thursday, health officials have been bracing for the possibility for a while. During the campaign, Trump vowed he'd let Kennedy to \"go wild\" on health if he won.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks. The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",

      "The recall is the ninth issued by the CPSC in the last three years. The recalls and two product warnings impacted more than 3 million units and are associated with serious injuries from head, neck or chest entrapment and 18 deaths, the federal agency stated.",
      "CPSC data shows that 92% of fatalities associated with adult portable bed rails are from entrapment, usually of the head or neck.",
      "The agency issued new mandatory safety standards for adult portable bed rails in January 2023.",
      "Often purchased for sick or frail older people, the side rails or metal bars are used on hospital beds and in home care with the idea of helping patients pull themselves up or to keep them from falling out of bed.

    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Negrin. \"But it's fact.\"",

    "title": "Some U.S. women are being asked to prepay for their baby",
    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

    "story": [
      "Satirical publication The Onion said it has bought Alex Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction for an undisclosed price, with the backing of the Connecticut families of eight victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and one first responder.",
      "Jones owes more than $1 billion in defamation judgments to the families for calling the massacre a hoax. In a statement from their attorneys, the families said the purchase is \"putting an end to the misinformation machine that Jones used to defame the families and victims for years.\"",
      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",
      "The purchase was confirmed by conspiracy theorist Jones, who posted a video on X saying that The Onion bought his company. \"The Connecticut Democrats with the Onion newspaper bought us,\" he said in the post, describing the bidding as \"competitive.\"",
      "The statement from the Sandy Hook families said the purchase includes Infowars' intellectual property, which includes its website, customer lists and inventory, as well as some social media accounts and production equipment used by Jones to air his shows.",
      "\"The Connecticut families agreed to forgo a portion of their recovery to increase the overall value of The Onion's bid, enabling its success,\" according to the statement.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",
      "Yoder, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas, also criticized the USPS for focusing on packages rather than traditional mail delivery, which he said remains the largest revenue generator for the postal service.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",

    "title": "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, experts say.",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "The hamburger chain pulled the burgers from restaurants in several states after the outbreak was announced.",

      "\"There does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak at McDonald's restaurants,\" the FDA stated.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night obtained by CBS News, McDonald's said it had found an \"alternate supplier\" for the approximately 900 restaurants which had temporarily stopped serving Quarter Pounders with slivered onions",
      "\"Over the past week, these restaurants resumed the sale of Quarter Pounder burgers with slivered onions,\" McDonald's said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",
      "\"Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,\" Rosner wrote. \"After a run of unseasonably hot autumn data, today's number cools fears of an imminent slowdown in the pace of rate cuts.\"",

      "The inflation report marks the first since the November 5 election, which handed former President Donald Trump another win. But the president-elect's economic policies, which include a broad-based tariff on all imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary, economists say.",

Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",
      "The Biden administration is \"saddling working Americans with Ivy League debt,\" said Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in a September statement.",

The statement from the City Manager's Office and Monterey Police Department contained few details about the case and said they would not make any other public statements related to the investigation.",
      "The incident allegedly occurred somewhere between a minute before midnight on Oct. 7, 2017 and 7 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2017 at 1 Old Golf Course Road, the location of the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel. A police report was filed with Monterey Police Department three days later, on Oct. 12, 2017.",

      "Here's what to know about unified government under a second Trump term:",
      "A Republican-led House and Senate",
      "The GOP secured narrow majorities in both chambers in the 2024 elections, with at least 52 seats in the Senate and 218 in the House. But both margins are extremely narrow and may even shrink temporarily as Trump selects GOP members of Congress for top administration posts. Still, he and allies are bullish about the mandate Republicans have been given with their election victories, pledging to move swiftly on his agenda.",
      "\"The only way we're able to work quickly is because we have unified control of the Congress \u2014 both chambers now and the White House \u2014 beginning in January,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday, celebrating Republicans' \"decisive win across the nation.\"",
      "Trump also came into office in his first term with majorities in the House and Senate, with a larger majority in the House eight years ago, becoming the second Republican president since President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enjoy a trifecta upon taking office. But Republicans acknowledge that they squandered opportunities in the beginning of his first term and have vowed to move more quickly this time.",
      "\"We all look back and recognize that the Republican Party was not fully prepared for that moment, and precious time was wasted in the beginning of that Congress,\" Johnson said. \"We are not going to make those mistakes again; we will be ready on Day One.\"",
      "In the upper chamber, Sen. John Thune, elected this week to serve as majority leader in the next Congress after 17 years with Sen. Mitch McConnell at the helm, celebrated the GOP victory.",
      "\"Now the real work begins \u2014 delivering on our agenda,\" Thune said.",
      "Implementing Trump's agenda",
      "At the top of the list of pledges Trump made during his campaign is border security. He pledged to shut down the border on Day One and conduct mass deportations.",
      "Johnson and Thune, too, say border security is a top priority. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of senators negotiated the strictest immigration legislation in decades, but Senate Republicans ultimately blocked the package at Trump's urging.",
      "The Republican-led approach on border security next year, should it materialize, is expected to go further and is likely to face resistance from Democrats and even some within Trump's party.",
      "Republicans are also eager to enact new economic policies, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire in 2025, along with policies aimed at restoring U.S. energy dominance and cutting government spending waste.",
      "With narrow majorities in both chambers, Trump's key legislative priorities could still face obstacles. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who's among a handful of Senate Republicans who have reliably broken with Trump in the past, outlined to CBS News that with 60 votes needed to end debate on most legislation in the Senate, \"by definition, the Trump administration will need Democratic votes to do big things.\"",
      "\"In recent history I've been quite good at working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" Young said, adding that he's hopeful he can \"help President Trump advance his agenda.\"",
      "For the Senate, the first task will be approving Trump's nominations.",
      "Confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees",
      "Some of Trump's Cabinet selections are making waves across the political sphere, prompting questions from some GOP senators about whether some controversial nominees will be able to make it through Senate confirmation.",
      "While some selections were expected, others have caught even Republicans by surprise. At the top of that category is Trump's selection for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction.",
      "Thune said the Senate's priority at the start of the year will be confirming Trump's nominees, pledging to oversee an aggressive schedule until the nominees are confirmed.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has suggested he'd like to get his eventual nominees in place through recess appointments, effectively bypassing the Senate's confirmation process in a maneuver that hasn't been utilized in a decade. High-ranking Republican senators, including Thune, have said that they will work to process Trump's nominees at a rapid clip, while remaining open to recess nominations.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who lost a bid for leader to Thune, told reporters on Thursday that both the president's authority to make recess appointments and the Senate's advice and consent responsibilities are granted by the Constitution.",
      "\"The question is, how do you reconcile those two,\" Cornyn said.",
      "\"I think we all would like for the President to be successful and I agree he's had a mandate here,\" Cornyn also said. \"But we have a job to do, as well.\"",
      "The first 100 days",
      "The first 100 days of a president's term have historically been a yardstick to measure the new leader's governing ability. It's a practice that Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, characterizes as \"mythical.\"",
      "\"It's mythical because of Franklin Roosevelt,\" she said. \"And that's also why it's never happened again.\"",
      "Roosevelt, who quickly swore in his entire Cabinet and passed a slew of key legislation in the beginning of his term, had massive majorities in the House and Senate, paired with large Electoral College and popular vote victories. The unified control enabled Roosevelt to have \"a spectacular 100 days,\" Kamarck added.",
      "Since then, the first 100 days has been the first benchmark at which the effectiveness of a president is judged: is the Cabinet appointed and confirmed by the Senate? What signature legislation has been enacted? During Trump's first term, his first 100 days were marked by a pile of executive orders, a chaotic and lengthy effort to confirm his Cabinet and setbacks on his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The dynamics are different as Trump prepares for his second term, with the party more unified behind him, a stronger relationship with lawmakers and a better grasp of the workings of government than when he first took office in 2017.",

      "Before Senate Republicans elected their leaders for the upcoming 119th Congress, Trump demanded that the candidates agree to recess appointments, which would give him the option of bypassing the Senate's role of approving or rejecting the president's nominations. Trump argued that without the ability to temporarily install nominees he would not be able to fill the positions in a timely manner.",
      "The legal basis for recess appointments emanates from a constitutional clause that gives the president \"the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\" A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 concluded that recess appointments could only be made when the Senate is not in session for 10 or more days, after President Barack Obama made controversial appointments when senators were on break.",

The House must also agree to allow the Senate to adjourn, but Chavetz says if the House does not agree, or if it disagrees with the Senate on the length of adjournment, then the president has the constitutional power to adjourn both chambers for a timeframe of his choosing.",
      "\"That second route has never been used before in U.S. history, so no one is quite sure how it would work,\" Chafetz said.",
      "A recess appointment, however, does not have the same benefits as a nominee confirmed by the Senate. Without Senate approval, the appointee would not be paid. The appointee can serve in the role for up to two years, depending on when the appointment was made. After that, the individual could be installed again through a recess appointment or the regular confirmation process.",
      "Some senators, including Republicans who will be in the majority come January, showed little appetite for giving up their constitutional power, especially after Trump announced that he intended to nominate Gaetz to lead the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Wednesday. \"If the president proceeds with that nominee, I think it shows the importance of having the Senate advice and consent process.\"",
      "\"I have concerns that he can't get across the finish line, and we're going to spend a lot of political capital,\" Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters Thursday. \"I say we. A lot of people will spend a lot of political capital on something that, that even if they got done, you'd have to wonder if it was worth it.\"",
      "Cramer added that Gaetz has \"got a really steep hill to climb to get lots of votes, including mine.\"",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday after Trump announced his selection. The timing came days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct. Gaetz was also the subject of a previous Justice Department investigation that sought to determine if he violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws. No charges were filed, and Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday when asked by reporters about Gaetz. \"That's a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the Judiciary Committee in doing that vetting and advice and consent.\"",
      "\"I don't think we should be circumventing the Senate's responsibilities, but I think it's premature to be talking about recess appointments,\" Cornyn added.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for conducting confirmation hearings for the attorney general nominee. Several other Judiciary Committee members also weighed in Thursday.",
      "\"The bottom line is our responsibility in the Senate is advice and consent,\" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee chairman.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said recess appointments should be used \"judiciously,\" adding that he has concerns about \"blanket recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said he could name between \"five to 10 Republicans who are seriously considering voting against\" Gaetz \"and insisting that there will be a vote.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri indicated he would not have an issue if Trump made recess appointments, saying the president \"has total authority to make recess appointments.\"",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

      "The Defense Department's annual report on suicides in the military released Thursday said suicides among active-duty military rose from 331 in 2022 to 363 in 2023.",
      "\"Admittedly yes, that long-term trend is gradually increasing,\" Dr. Timothy Hoyt, Deputy Director of the Office of Force Resiliency at the Defense Department told reporters on a call.",
      "The suicide rate has grown from 17 per 100,000 active duty service members in 2011 to 26 in 2023, according to data released in the annual report for 2023, although the rate decreased for one year from 2020-2021.",
      "Active duty service members who died by suicide in 2023 were largely enlisted males under the age of 30, accounting for 61% of suicides. The most common method of suicide was firearms, at 65%, followed by hanging or asphyxiation, at 28%.",
      "Defense officials said the suicide rates were similar to rates across the U.S. population between 2011 and 2022.",

      "Kennedy has a long record of criticizing vaccines, including spreading misleading claims about their safety.",
      "He has vowed to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy has claimed a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity. He has also urged removing fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. His odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called\u00a0\"anti-science, fringe public health stances,\"\u00a0but with\u00a0Republicans in the majority\u00a0come January, Trump's nominees will have an easier path to confirmation.",
      "Despite the expected opposition to Kennedy's nomination \u2014 along with other controversial choices to lead national security agencies and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department \u2014 Trump has told associates in recent days he is standing by his pick for health chief.",
      "\"No one can talk him out of it,\" one of the sources familiar with the pick said Thursday.",

      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food.

      "The sprawling HHS Department encompasses a number of agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration. As HHS Secretary, Kennedy would also oversee the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is charged with caring for undocumented and unaccompanied children apprehended along the border.",
      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that often clashes with the FDA and in some ways is closely aligned with Kennedy's calls to get chemicals out of foods, put out a statement condemning his nomination.",
      "\"Nominating an anti-vaxxer like Kennedy to HHS is like putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA,\" the group's president, Dr. Peter G. Lurie, said in a statement. \"CSPI opposes this nomination and any other nominees who are a direct threat to science and evidence-based solutions.\"",
      "But one prominent Democrat, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, said in a social media post that he was \"excited by the news\" of Kennedy's nomination. He praised Kennedy for helping to defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 but said he hoped that Kennedy would embrace personal choice on vaccines, rather than banning them. He also said he was optimistic about Kennedy's vow to take on big pharma and high drug costs for Americans. Polis also backed Kennedy's criticism of \"entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA\" that \"are not doing their job, they're not protecting our kids,\" in particular from pesticides used in agriculture.",
      "Polis later clarified his praise, saying, \"Science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation's health policy and the science-backed decision to get vaccinated improves public health and safety.\"",
      "At the same time, Polis has also launched a policy entity with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker aimed at taking on other parts of the Trump agenda.",
      "As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.

    "summary": "Sen. Bob Casey is locked in a tight race with Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania. There will be an automatic recount of the votes, state officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Bob Casey is not giving up on retaining his U.S. Senate seat. The three-term Democrat is currently locked in a tight race with Dave McCormick, trailing the Republican by just over 29,000 votes as of 4 p.m. Wednesday. CBS News has not issued a projection in the race.",
      "Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt announced Wednesday afternoon that unofficial results in the race have triggered a statewide recount.",
      "That's because vote totals for McCormick and Casey are within a 0.5% margin, which triggers a statewide recount under state law.",
      "According to the Department of State, as of 4 p.m. on Thursday, Casey received 48.53% of the vote with 3,359,086 votes and McCormick had 48.90% with 3,385,115.",
      "Counties must begin the recount by Nov. 20, the announcement says. Counties must finish the recount by noon on Nov. 26 and report the results to the secretary of the commonwealth by Nov. 27 at 12 p.m.",
      "In a livestreamed press conference Thursday, Schmidt shared more details about the recount. Counties will begin the recount as soon as they finish counting all of the votes the first time, he said. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were about 80,000 ballots left to be counted. That includes about 20,000 mail-in and absentee ballots and about 60,000 provisional ballots.",
      "During the recount, Schmidt said, counties will use \"a different method or different equipment to tabulate the results\" than they used in the initial tally to identify any potential issues.",
      "The deadline for counties to certify election results this year is Nov. 25. Counties will certify all results except the Senate race by that day and will certify the Senate results as soon as their recounts are complete, Schmidt said.",
      "The results of the recount will be published online Nov. 27, which is the day before Thanksgiving, Schmidt said. In the meantime, the elections return page on the state website will continue to update as counties update their unofficial vote tallies in the original count, Schmidt said. These updates are separate from the recount.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, McCormick's spokesperson Elizabeth Gregory said, \"Senator-Elect McCormick's lead is insurmountable, which the AP made clear in calling the race. A recount will be a waste of time and taxpayer money, but it is Senator Casey's prerogative. Senator-Elect McCormick knows what it's like to lose an election and is sure Senator Casey will eventually reach the right conclusion.\"",
      "According to an earlier statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State, Casey's campaign did not waive an automatic recount by noon Wednesday.",
      "Casey has not made a public appearance since his election night watch party in Scranton, but he posted a video on his social media accounts Tuesday.",
      "\"The American democratic process was born in Pennsylvania, and that process will play out,\" he said in the video on X.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick is moving forward. The businessman declared victory during a speech in Pittsburgh Friday, and he has spent this week in Washington going through the Senate orientation process.",
      "\"The people have spoken. There's a clear, clear victory,\" McCormick said last week.",
      "CBS News Philadelphia reached out to both campaigns Wednesday, but neither made the candidates available to speak.",
      "Casey's campaign has said it's been waiting for outstanding votes from around the state, from mail-in ballots to overseas and military votes and provisional ballots. In Philadelphia, the state's largest county and one where Casey has garnered more than 78% of the vote, commissioners say the number of votes left out there is running thin.",
      "\"We had about 20,000 provisional ballots to start with. We've already counted 11,000 of those,\" city commissioner Seth Bluestein said Wednesday.",
      "Bluestein told CBS News Philadelphia the election board wrapped up voting on outstanding mail-in votes Wednesday. He says a few thousand could not be counted for various reasons, mostly a lack of a signature or secrecy envelope.",
      "As for the remaining provisional ballots, Bluestein said the board will take those up on Friday. But he warned, \"most of those will probably end up not getting counted.\"",
      "The recount will cost more than $1 million in taxpayer funds, the Department of State estimates. Schmidt said Wednesday that the most recent legally triggered recount -- in the 2022 Senate primary between McCormick and Mehmet Oz -- cost about $1,053,000.",
      "McCormick files lawsuit against Bucks County",
      "Bucks County officials on Tuesday made the decision to count 405 mail-in ballots that had incorrect or missing dates on the outer envelopes.",
      "\"The courts I believe will take this up, so we're going to get sued either way. I'd rather be on the side of counting ballots than not counting them, is my thought,\" Bob Harvie, the chair of the Bucks County Board of Elections said prior to voting in favor of counting the ballots.",
      "Now, a lawsuit's been filed on behalf of Dave McCormick, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Republican National Committee against the Bucks County Board of Elections for voting 2 to 1 in favor of counting those ballots.",
      "The lawsuit says in part, \"The Board's baffling decision not to enforce the date requirement and to count noncompliant ballots thus directly contravenes binding Pennsylvania law.\"",
      "Dating issues on mail-in ballots has been a long-time controversy in Pennsylvania. Last month, the state supreme court ruled mail-in ballots with missing or incorrect dates should be tossed for this election.",
      "The RNC and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania are also asking the state Supreme Court to order election officials in all 67 counties to not count undated or misdated mail ballots.",
      "A statement Thursday from the RNC said it filed the lawsuit \"to defend the dated ballot requirement, a critical election integrity safeguard, and to stop radical Democrats from counting illegal ballots as Bob Casey tries to steal the election.\"",

      "\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the [intelligence community], I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" Dr. Jon Kosloski, director, All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) told reporters during a briefing on the unclassified version of the annual report mandated by Congress.",

These conditions especially endanger those with mental health conditions, the report found.",

      "The Justice Department launched its civil investigation into Fulton County's jail in July 2023, after at least four Black inmates died in the mental health unit in a matter of weeks, including two who were killed by their cellmates. \"Within weeks of opening our investigation, six more Black men had died in the Jail,\" the Justice Department revealed. The family of one inmate, Lashawn Johnson, said he died in in the jail in 2022, after he was \"eaten alive\" by insects and bedbugs. About 91% of the jail's total population is Black, according to the report, compared to 45% of the overall Fulton County population.",
      "Justice Department investigators conducted multiple site visits, expert consultations and interviews with inmates and staff.",

      "\"We found that 75% of those who died in the Jail since January 2021 had a current mental health diagnosis or reported a history of mental illness,\" the report said.",

From 2022 to the present, according to the report, \"six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks.\" All six victims were Black men, the Justice Department said.",
      "Non-lethal violent assaults are also rampant inside the jail. In 2023, the Sheriff's Office said there were 1,054 assaults and more than 300 stabbings in the jail. The investigation also uncovered a pattern or practice of sexual abuse, according to the report.",
      "Announcing the report's findings, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Department said officials in Fulton County have taken \"preliminary steps\" to address the issues outlined in the report, but such measures are \"not enough.\"",

      "In some ways political giving defies neat categories, and some megadonors may have overlapping interests.\u00a0 Some donors' primary motivation may be an ideological commitment to unleashing the power of free markets, but that may also benefit their personal business interests.",
      "Others may be more transactional, fending off government investigations into their businesses or securing lucrative contracts, although that might coincide with their political beliefs.",
      "\"Megadonors can have a variety of financial, ideological or personal motivations for pouring millions into politics,\" said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Documented, an investigative watchdog group. \"These motivations can operate on a spectrum or as a Venn diagram.\"",
      "But either way, with so much money flooding into American politics, it is helpful to be aware of the agendas and interests behind the torrent of cash gushing into the system. What follows is a taxonomy of the Republican donor class in the wake of a momentous election that has many wondering where the country is headed and who stands to benefit from the money that is driving the change.",
      "The Oligarch",
      "One dictionary definition of an oligarch is a \"very wealthy business leader who helps to run the government.\" That would seem to fit Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who personally gave more than $130 million (and his super PAC gave $200 million) to help Trump win back the White House. Musk has wasted no time taking advantage of his election dividend.",
      "He's been weighing in on key staffing decisions, has been named to head up (along with Vivek Ramaswamy) a commission on government efficiency and, according to Axios, even joined a call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Musk also traveled with Trump to Washington Wednesday for meetings with President Biden and with congressional Republicans.",
      "Musk stands to benefit financially from that clout he has with the incoming administration. His companies are mammoth players across some of the most powerful sectors of the economy, from electric vehicles to rocketry and space exploration, from satellite-powered internet technology to artificial intelligence. According to the New York Times, Musk has at least 100 different contracts with the federal government with 17 different agencies. His SpaceX rocket company already has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts and stands to gain billions more during a Trump presidency.",
      "And Musk has carefully cultivated key government regulators who could bring him a financial windfall after Trump takes office. One, according to Politico, is FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who Trump is expected to name as the agency's chairman. Carr has been critical of his fellow commissioners for cutting Musk's Starlink satellite company out of the Biden administration's rural broadband program, denying him hundreds of millions or even potentially billions in subsidies.",
      "Meanwhile look for Musk to influence SEC and other regulatory appointments that could stop investigations into his businesses. But what makes Musk unique is that his influence far transcends U.S. policies that could benefit his own businesses. Musk, through his global business empire, has the power to affect geopolitics on a scale perhaps greater than any person outside of government in history.",
      "His personal wealth, estimated at $314 billion dollars (it jumped about $70 billion since Trump was elected), is greater than the GDP of multiple countries combined and the defense budgets of many industrialized Western countries. Musk's Starlink owns at least half of the satellites currently in orbit. Through Starlink, Musk has the power to alter the course of wars, since the communications constellation he controls is often the primary way governments can get internet access in combat zones. His ambitions seem boundless \u2014 he even hopes to be at the forefront of colonizing space.",
      "And none of that even takes into account his ownership of X, the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022 and positioned as a MAGA megaphone to help Trump.",
      "\"All oligarchs have wealth power at their disposal, but not all are positioned in the same way,\" said Jeffrey Winters, a professor at Northwestern who is an expert on oligarchs. \"Some sell candy bars everyone eats. Others are engaged in space, high tech, own major media or have defense contracts. This takes their power to another level.\"",
      "The Pragmatist",
      "These are the megadonors who are laser-focused on influencing policy and legislation on behalf of their business interests. They may be hard-edged conservatives, but they are pragmatic about how their political giving can help their bottom line and the American economy. A quintessential example would be Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, who gave $100,000,000 in the 2024 cycle, putting him at No. 5 on the list of top contributors, according to Open Secrets.",
      "A self-described \"Reagan Republican,\" Griffin has long given to more establishment-oriented Super PACs like the Senate Leadership Fund and its counterpart in the lower chamber, the Congressional Leadership Fund. He has not donated to Trump. Nor has he given money to political causes closely associated with Trump's America First agenda. Instead, he has been tactical in his giving, focusing often on Republican candidates in down-ballot races who have business experience or are military veterans and can give Congress a more business-oriented complexion.",
      "\"Griffin is more of an establishment Republican more aligned with the traditional goals of the party, rather than the Trumpy wing,\" says Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance expert.",
      "Griffin said in a statement to CBS News, \"I'm grateful for our country and for all those who've come before us. Going forward, we all share a duty to further strengthen our nation and improve the lives of our fellow citizens. As such, I support solution-oriented leaders who share my commitment to individual rights and freedom, economic policies encouraging prosperity and upward mobility, access to high-quality education for all children and young adults, safe communities, and a strong national defense.\"",
      "A more cutting-edge example of the pragmatists are donors who back the crypto-currency industry.\u00a0Crypto Super PACs such as Fairshake and Defend American Jobs have been determined in their contributions to help elect pro-crypto candidates.",
      "Defend America Jobs poured in $40 million to help elect Bernie Moreno, the crypto-friendly candidate who defeated long-time Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race. Among those boosters of crypto and other digital currencies who gave heavily during the 2024 cycle were Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz ponied up $45.2 million to pro-crypto super PACs. CBS News was not able to reach Andreesen Horowitz for comment.",
      "Winklevoss Capital Management, the firm run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, chipped in another $5 million. \"The crypto army is striking!\" Tyler Winklevoss posted on X on Election NIght, hailing Brown's defeat. But bucking the trend toward purely partisan contributions, the crypto industry gives to Republicans and Democrats alike, so long as they commit to keeping their industry unshackled by government regulations.",
      "The Ideologue",
      "These megadonors are more driven by personal causes that are not directly tied to their business interests. A representative example is Miriam Adelson, who along with her now-deceased husband Sheldon Adelson has been a casino magnate and major supporter of Jewish and Israel causes. In 2024, Miriam Adelson contributed more than $132 million to help Trump's election effort. Adelson knows that her largesse drives results.",
      "After the Adelsons donated tens of millions of dollars to help Trump win the White House in 2016, the new president announced the U.S. government would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said he would move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Adelsons even offered to pay for the construction of the new embassy. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"These are passion projects, not attempts to feather the nest,\" says one Republican who knows Adelson but asked not to be named in discussing her donations.",
      "Another high-profile example of ideological givers are the billionaire shipping supply magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein. The Wisconsin-based manufacturers of cardboard boxes and other packaging supplies, the Uihleins' business skyrocketed in sales in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an e-commerce boom. The Uihleins did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, they were among the top five political donors, contributing more than $133 million to conservative causes. While much of their money went to Trump's election, they also gave generously to other MAGA-allied causes. They've given to so-called election integrity groups that questioned the results of the 2020 election, as well as organizations like Moms for Liberty, which advocates against public school curricula that mention LGBTQ rights or critical race theory and supports book bans.",
      "The Enigma",
      "Some megadonors are so discreet about their political giving that it is hard to know what category they belong in. One example is Tim Mellon, the reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon fortune who happens to have given more money to Trump's election (at least $197 million) than any other donor.",
      "Mellon doesn't go on cable TV or hobnob with politicos at party conventions, but he has written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some clues. Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income equality and the environment. But as Mellon's business career evolved, he developed a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business, which seems to have strongly shaped his political views.",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he bought an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Did that experience fuel his desire to influence politics with his vast fortune? Perhaps, but it is also the case that Mellon has contributed to causes that would seem to have little to do with his particular business interests.",
      "In the 2024 cycle he also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential run. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Trump, whom he was also backing financially.\u00a0 But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy.\u00a0 Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines \u2014 and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy. None of that would seem to help Mellon's personal business interests. Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Trump to nominate Matt Gaetz for attorney general",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:28:58 -0500",
    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Matt Gaetz, whose selection as attorney general prompted backlash, resigned from Congress.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate longtime ally GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to serve as his attorney general\u00a0\u2014 a choice that quickly prompted backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over Gaetz's history. Following Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Gaetz, who has represented Florida's 1st Congressional District since 2017, has been the focus of several investigations into his conduct.",
      "In a statement on social media, Trump praised him as a \"tenacious attorney\" who will \"end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.\"\u00a0Gaetz said\u00a0said on X, \"It will be an honor to serve as President Trump's Attorney General!\"",
      "If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department \u2014 a federal agency of more than 100,000 employees \u2014 and oversee its numerous investigative components, including the FBI. Gaetz's ascent to the Justice Department's top job will come at a unique time, after Mr. Trump spent all of his 2024 presidential campaign under federal investigation or prosecution.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday night that Gaetz had already submitted his letter resigning from Congress, effective immediately.",
      "\"That caught us by surprise a little bit,\" Johnson said. \"But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, 'Well, you can't have too many absences,'\" referring to the GOP's slim majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson said Florida law would allow Gaetz's replacement to be selected within the next eight weeks or so.",
      "\"I've already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said, 'Let's start the clock,'\" Johnson said.",
      "In the letter, later obtained by CBS News, Gaetz wrote: \"I hereby resign, as United States Representatives for Florida's First Congressional District, effective immediately, and I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration.\"",
      "In a confirmation process, Gaetz would undoubtedly face questions about an ongoing review by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, which said in a statement earlier this year it was looking into allegations that Gaetz may have \"engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\"",
      "Prior to his resignation, the committee had scheduled a vote Friday on whether to release its report into Gaetz, three sources with knowledge of the committee's work told CBS News. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, on Thursday called on the House Ethics panel to preserve and share the report, as well as \"all relevant documentation\" on Gaetz with his committee.",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing and maintained his innocence throughout a Justice Department probe \u2014 closed last year \u2014\u00a0 into allegations that he violated sex trafficking laws and obstructed justice. Federal prosecutors in Florida did not file any charges in the case and informed the congressman that the case was closed.",
      "Senators, who will vote on his confirmation, began to weigh in as they learned of Trump's intent to nominate Gaetz.",
      "\"He wants to be the top cop, so I would say that yeah, he's certainly going to have to answer all those things, whether they're legit or not legit,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said of past allegations against Gaetz. \"Some of these investigations are still open, obviously.\" Cramer also said the pick was \"a surprise to me\" and expressed some reservations.",
      "\"The one thing about Matt was that concerned me a little bit. I didn't like the way he handled the squabble with with Speaker McCarthy.\" He said he was for every one of Trump's other nominees, adding, \"Matt could earn that, but I'm not there right out of the chute with Matt.\"",
      "\"This one was not on my bingo card,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters. \"I don't think this is a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general.\"",
      "Senate Republican conference Chair John Barrasso, when asked by reporters about Gaetz, said, \"The president is going to continue to make his appointments. We're going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News that the most conceivable, easiest and fastest way to install Gaetz would be for the House and Senate to recess shortly after Inauguration Day so that Gaetz and others could be installed through recess appointments, a temporary option that doesn't require Senate confirmation.",
      "One former senior Justice Department official during Trump's first administration told CBS News that \"Matt Gaetz has no business running DOJ.\"",
      "Gaetz, who has served on the House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration, would take over the post as the first confirmed attorney general under a Trump presidency since Bill Barr. Barr resigned in 2020 when then-President Trump sought to remain in power after he lost the election. Barr left office at the end of that year and was replaced by an acting attorney general, Jeff Rosen. Rosen and a number of his subordinates later testified against Trump during a hearing of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. The former officials alleged that Trump had sought to pressure the Justice Department to investigate his claims of election fraud.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland, a former federal judge, appointed numerous special counsels to conduct investigations into high-profile figures, including Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and Mr. Trump.",
      "Gaetz's expected nomination comes as some of the president-elect's supporters have called for change inside the Justice Department. Attorney Mark Paoletta, who was thought to be in the running to serve as Mr. Trump's attorney general, said, \"Career DOJ lawyers must be fully committed to implementing President Trump's policies or they should leave or be fired.\"",
      "\"If the president wants to deport illegal aliens, secure the border, ban race-based 'affirmative action' and DEI, investigate antisemitism, halt Big Tech censorship, grant pardons and commutations to Jan 6th defendants, he has every right to expect that these perfectly lawful policies are implemented,\" Paoletta wrote. \"It is absolutely unacceptable for career employees to seek to thwart this policy agenda.\"",
      "Trump's first term brought tension between the White House and his two Senate-confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Barr. Sessions, who angered Trump because he recused himself from the Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, was forced out shortly after the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "In a statement released after last week's election results, the Justice Department said it is \"committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration.\"",
      "Beyond the political implications, like attorneys general of both parties who have preceded him, Gaetz would likely try to shape the Justice Department around the priorities of the president. And he would be all but certain to reverse course on various Biden-era policies, too.",
      "Trump has called for mass deportations, pardons for some of those convicted in the ongoing Jan. 6 investigation and regulation slashing \u2014 all actions in which the Justice Department is likely to play a central role.",
      "Trump and Republicans have long criticized Garland's leadership and targeted various Justice Department initiatives, including the expansion of civil rights and business regulation cases. Under the Trump administration, that is likely to come to an end.",
      "Much of next attorney general's work would depend on who Trump appoints to lead various Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also likely be key to Trump's agenda because this office will issue decisions on the department's legal interpretation of the president's decisions. For instance, it could cement the president's power to fire certain political appointees and career government officials.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term. Since then, however, the president-elect has criticized the Bureau amid the federal probes into Trump's conduct, and he has vowed to implement reforms.",
      "Michael Kaplan, \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay, \n                                                  \n                                  Kaia Hubbard, \n                                                  \n                      Fin G\u00f3mez, \n                                                  \n                      Alan He and \n                                                  \n                                  Margaret Brennan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, experts say.",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

      "The legislation would not apply to school employees, emergencies or people helping young children or those with disabilities, and schools would still be able to provide single-use and family bathroom facilities.",

      "Transgender and gender-nonbinary teens who were subject to restroom or locker room restrictions had a higher prevalence of sexual assault, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Pediatrics. About 36% of surveyed teens reported sexual assault, the study found.",

    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "summary": "1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led archeologists to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that was decisive in the spread of Islam in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",
      "In recent years, the digs have returned and thousands of stolen artifacts have been repatriated.",

The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",
      "The results were published Friday in the journal Science.",
      "China has launched several spacecraft to the moon. In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",
      "The moon's far side is pockmarked by craters and has fewer of the near side's flat, dark plains carved by lava flows. Why the two halves are so different remains a mystery, said study co-author Qiu-Li Li from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",

      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",

    "story": [
      "CHICAGO \u2014 The city of Chicago has been covering the cost of thousands of hours of police overtime at street festivals, despite event organizers being required to pay for it under city law, records show.",
      "Chicago hosts hundreds of street festivals annually, with about 1,300 held between 2021 and 2023. For those festivals, nearly 2,800 Chicago police officers worked a combined total of 27,000 hours of overtime to patrol the events, according to a CBS News Data Team analysis of police overtime data and special events permits.",
      "The overtime that has gone unpaid likely costs city taxpayers millions of dollars, based on previous police spending.",
      "Last week, alderpeople grilled officials from the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, demanding to know how many police resources were poured into neighborhood street festivals while raising concerns about officer burnout amid so many competing demands.",
      "The hearing took place as city officials looked for revenues that would help them avoid raising property taxes, and after a busy summer that pulled officers out of neighborhoods and into events such as the Democratic National Convention, NASCAR and Lollapalooza. The police department is working with a yearslong decline in staffing and now has more than about 1,000 fewer officers than it did before the pandemic.",
      "\"It's my understanding there are a number of events in the city where, for whatever reason, we don't ask the event organizer to reimburse us for things like police resources, police and fire, paramedic, traffic control,\" Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd) said during the hearing last week. \"Some events spend lots of money on those sorts of things, like Lollapalooza, for example. Yet other events don't get charged these things.\"",
      "City law requires the police commander of special events to \"calculate the estimated hourly cost for the personnel required for the event, and \u2026 charge the applicant for such services\" in excess of 12 shifts.",
      "But after months of public records requests, the Department of Finance was not able to produce invoices for city employees staffing street festivals. The department provided invoice data for traffic control aides at events including Riot Fest, Lollapalooza and several 5Ks, and referred CBS News to the city's Public Safety Administration for police overtime.",
      "That department, which has a separate budget from the police department, handles contracts such as ShotSpotter for the police and fire departments and the Office of Emergency Management and Communications. The Public Safety Administration hasn't responded to records requests for police overtime for special events and officials there did not return requests for comment.",
      "Local aldermen are also starting to ask questions. Alds. Raymond Lopez (15th), Matt O'Shea (19th), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), Chris Taliaferro (29th), Scott Waguespack (32nd), Andre Vasquez (40th), Bennett Lawson (44th), Leni Manaa Hoppenworth (48th), and Maria Hadden (49th) all pressed DCASE on the issue at last week's hearing, with several asking for evidence of the required reimbursements.",
      "Some also requested a list of Chicago's special events that require additional police resources, while others asked for cost analyses for various special events.",
      "\"I think there is a lack of equity in how we're charging special events for reimbursements to the city of Chicago, and as a legislator facing a billion-dollar budget deficit and being asked to sock it to my constituents with more property taxes,\" Reilly said. \"Using police officers and paramedics to support large, private and oftentimes profit-making special events, that's not a luxury we have. Bureaucrats may think this stuff is free, but our constituents, the taxpayers, pay for it.\"",
      "In an interview with Block Club Chicago, Reilly clarified that concerns about unpaid reimbursements came from members within the police department and \"other departments that intersect with special events.\"",
      "\"It's unacceptable. And the worst part is, we may never get a real accounting of what exactly we're owed,\" Reilly said. \"I don't think anybody could afford police costs or overtime.\"",
      "Street festivals can be a boost to neighborhood economies, raising awareness and funds for local groups and nonprofits. They often require months of planning and coordination with various city departments before a permit can be issued.",
      "Despite rising production costs for street festivals, the city provides significant concessions, including steeply discounted street closures and covering the cost of taking privatized parking meters offline.",
      "Per city ordinance, organizers typically pay a $100 permit fee if filed on time. Street closures cost event producers $100 per day per block for a street festival permit downtown and $50 for other parts of the city. Filming permits for TV shows to shut down a street are more expensive, running around $500, while permits for developers moving heavy equipment and cranes can cost thousands of dollars.",
      "Alderpeople also pressed DCASE officials about revenue loss from parking meters for special events being passed on to taxpayers. The Chicago Tribune reported that the city paid $600,000 to the city's private parking meter company to cover the revenue lost by taking parking meters offline during NASCAR the last two years.",
      "With a nearly $1 billion budget gap next year, the hidden costs of hosting large-scale events have become more pronounced.",
      "Despite these concessions, Hank Zemola, CEO of Special Events Management, believes that requiring him and other event producers to pay for police overtime would effectively kill most festivals.",
      "Zemola has been involved in producing Chicago special events since the 1970s. His company is listed on at least 23 permit applications this year, including for some of the city's most popular street festivals: Pride Fest, Northalsted Market Days, Ribfest, Taste of Greektown, Chinatown Summer Fair and more.",
      "\"I don't think anybody could afford police costs or overtime. I think pretty much 90% of events would be done,\" Zemola said.",
      "All special event producers are required to present security plans to the police for feedback before the city's events department issues a permit. The amount of private security is determined by various factors, including the event's history, location, current events and crime trends. Event organizers suggest a security plan and the police department approves, denies and makes suggestions.",
      "Zemola only uses off-duty officers for the street festivals he produces. He says it's an expensive endeavor, costing tens of thousands of dollars depending on the size of the event.",
      "Because event security plans are assessed by the police department, Zemola argues his company should not be responsible for overtime costs for police officers sent to his events.",
      "\"It's like someone coming and painting your house and then saying, 'I want you to pay for it.' \u2026 Well, I didn't want you to paint my house,\" Zemola said. \"I ordered all this [security] so we wouldn't have to do that.\"",
      "Special Events Management has, however, paid for traffic control services for various athletic events it organizes, according to records from the Department of Finance.",
      "Duff Entertainment, the organizer for the 2024 Taste of Randolph, declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that the company has not been billed for police overtime associated with this year's festival.",
      "\"The West Loop Community Organization (WLCO) and Duff Entertainment have confirmed that they are actively looking into this and have reached out to the City of Chicago to get clarification on next steps,\" Kelli Packer, a spokesperson for Duff Entertainment, said in a statement.",
      "Large special events are paying their way",
      "Unpaid police resources being poured into profit-making neighborhood street festivals aren't the only issue. The city ultimately polices all large events that are quintessential to life and culture in Chicago, assigning officers to manage them on overtime.",
      "Chicago deployed more than 2,400 officers at last year's Pride Parade. Though officials sought to reduce that number this year, police brass ultimately canceled officers' days off to staff patrols following the parade.",
      "The city will typically eat the costs associated with parades such as Pride, St. Patrick's Day, Bud Billiken and the upcoming Magnificent Mile Lights Parade.",
      "The organizers for some events, such as Lollapalooza and the Chicago Marathon, will reimburse the city for overtime. C3 Presents, which organizes Lollapalooza, was billed more than $100,000 for traffic control personnel at the concert last year, in addition to police overtime.",
      "Meanwhile, Special Events Management was billed nearly $5,000 for traffic aides for the Abbott 5k and more than $11,000 for the Shamrock Shuffle in 2023, according to invoice data from the Finance Department. But that figure does not include the roughly 113 police officers working overtime at the Shamrock Shuffle last year.",
      "And while financial costs are the top concern at budget hearings, aldermen also highlighted how special events remove police from neighborhoods while contributing to officer burnout.",
      "\"We have several large-scale events on the same day,\" said Ald. Matt O'Shea (19th). \"Hundreds and hundreds of police officers, days off canceled, double time pay. The cash register is ringing.\"",
      "Of the 67 police officers who worked Taste of Randolph last year, 27 were working on what was supposed to be their day off. Of the roughly 350 officers working 2023's Pride Fest, 254 \u2014 or 73% \u2014 were on a canceled day off.",
      "During Lollapalooza weekend last year, more than 1,800 officers worked the concert weekend, accounting for 16% of the entire police force that month, according to personnel data from the Inspector General's office.",
      "And of those 1,800 officers at last year's Lollapalooza, about 1,180 \u2014 or 65% \u2014 worked on their day off. More than 500 officers were pulled out of neighborhoods to staff the concert, according to an analysis of overtime data staffed to the event by unit. Additional officers from detectives to forensics were tending to crowds instead of cases.",
      "Alderpeople are looking to overhaul the system, with many saying at DCASE's budget hearing that the city needs to find and close the loophole it has created.",
      "At last year's City Council budget hearing, police Supt. Larry Snelling said police presence at street festivals was \"a serious pull on manpower.\"",
      "The Police Department \"does not provide private security for events, but does provide resources in the areas of the event to ensure the safety of all those living, working and visiting the area,\" CBS and Block Club previously reported.",
      "DCASE officials revealed at last week's hearing that the department is not part of the invoicing process for reimbursement of police overtime, concerning many aldermen that permits are being issued continuously to event producers with unpaid tabs.",
      "\"We need to do a better job of identifying where we need to charge more,\" O'Shea said. \"We need to do a better job of when we're permitting these events.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 10:53:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Even with unified GOP control of government, Trump's agenda and some of his more controversial nominees may run into some opposition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 When President-elect Donald Trump returns to office next year with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, he'll enjoy a unified government that's expected to ease the way for his agenda and his Cabinet and other nominees.",
      "But even with unified party control of government, approving a president's agenda is no easy feat \u2014 and opposition from members of a president's own party is expected, especially given the narrow majorities.",
      "Here's what to know about unified government under a second Trump term:",
      "A Republican-led House and Senate",
      "The GOP secured narrow majorities in both chambers in the 2024 elections, with at least 52 seats in the Senate and 218 in the House. But both margins are extremely narrow and may even shrink temporarily as Trump selects GOP members of Congress for top administration posts. Still, he and allies are bullish about the mandate Republicans have been given with their election victories, pledging to move swiftly on his agenda.",
      "\"The only way we're able to work quickly is because we have unified control of the Congress \u2014 both chambers now and the White House \u2014 beginning in January,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday, celebrating Republicans' \"decisive win across the nation.\"",
      "Trump also came into office in his first term with majorities in the House and Senate, with a larger majority in the House eight years ago, becoming the second Republican president since President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enjoy a trifecta upon taking office. But Republicans acknowledge that they squandered opportunities in the beginning of his first term and have vowed to move more quickly this time.",
      "\"We all look back and recognize that the Republican Party was not fully prepared for that moment, and precious time was wasted in the beginning of that Congress,\" Johnson said. \"We are not going to make those mistakes again; we will be ready on Day One.\"",
      "In the upper chamber, Sen. John Thune, elected this week to serve as majority leader in the next Congress after 17 years with Sen. Mitch McConnell at the helm, celebrated the GOP victory.",
      "\"Now the real work begins \u2014 delivering on our agenda,\" Thune said.",
      "Implementing Trump's agenda",
      "At the top of the list of pledges Trump made during his campaign is border security. He pledged to shut down the border on Day One and conduct mass deportations.",
      "Johnson and Thune, too, say border security is a top priority. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of senators negotiated the strictest immigration legislation in decades, but Senate Republicans ultimately blocked the package at Trump's urging.",
      "The Republican-led approach on border security next year, should it materialize, is expected to go further and is likely to face resistance from Democrats and even some within Trump's party.",
      "Republicans are also eager to enact new economic policies, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire in 2025, along with policies aimed at restoring U.S. energy dominance and cutting government spending waste.",
      "With narrow majorities in both chambers, Trump's key legislative priorities could still face obstacles. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who's among a handful of Senate Republicans who have reliably broken with Trump in the past, outlined to CBS News that with 60 votes needed to end debate on most legislation in the Senate, \"by definition, the Trump administration will need Democratic votes to do big things.\"",
      "\"In recent history I've been quite good at working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" Young said, adding that he's hopeful he can \"help President Trump advance his agenda.\"",
      "For the Senate, the first task will be approving Trump's nominations.",
      "Confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees",
      "Some of Trump's Cabinet selections are making waves across the political sphere, prompting questions from some GOP senators about whether some controversial nominees will be able to make it through Senate confirmation.",
      "While some selections were expected, others have caught even Republicans by surprise. At the top of that category is Trump's selection for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction.",
      "Thune said the Senate's priority at the start of the year will be confirming Trump's nominees, pledging to oversee an aggressive schedule until the nominees are confirmed.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has suggested he'd like to get his eventual nominees in place through recess appointments, effectively bypassing the Senate's confirmation process in a maneuver that hasn't been utilized in a decade. High-ranking Republican senators, including Thune, have said that they will work to process Trump's nominees at a rapid clip, while remaining open to recess nominations.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who lost a bid for leader to Thune, told reporters on Thursday that both the president's authority to make recess appointments and the Senate's advice and consent responsibilities are granted by the Constitution.",
      "\"The question is, how do you reconcile those two,\" Cornyn said.",
      "\"I think we all would like for the President to be successful and I agree he's had a mandate here,\" Cornyn also said. \"But we have a job to do, as well.\"",
      "The first 100 days",
      "The first 100 days of a president's term have historically been a yardstick to measure the new leader's governing ability. It's a practice that Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, characterizes as \"mythical.\"",
      "\"It's mythical because of Franklin Roosevelt,\" she said. \"And that's also why it's never happened again.\"",
      "Roosevelt, who quickly swore in his entire Cabinet and passed a slew of key legislation in the beginning of his term, had massive majorities in the House and Senate, paired with large Electoral College and popular vote victories. The unified control enabled Roosevelt to have \"a spectacular 100 days,\" Kamarck added.",
      "Since then, the first 100 days has been the first benchmark at which the effectiveness of a president is judged: is the Cabinet appointed and confirmed by the Senate? What signature legislation has been enacted? During Trump's first term, his first 100 days were marked by a pile of executive orders, a chaotic and lengthy effort to confirm his Cabinet and setbacks on his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The dynamics are different as Trump prepares for his second term, with the party more unified behind him, a stronger relationship with lawmakers and a better grasp of the workings of government than when he first took office in 2017.",
      "Speaking to the House Republican conference on Wednesday, Trump reveled in the shared GOP victory.",

    "summary": "After Alyssa Burkett was murdered in broad daylight in Carrollton, Texas, Andrew Beard, the father of her child, became a suspect. Investigators would eventually discover a twisted murder plot they say was orchestrated by his fianc\u00e9e, Holly Elkins.",
    "story": [
      "Three days after 24-year-old Alyssa Burkett was shot and then stabbed to death outside her office in Carrollton, Texas, Andrew Beard \u2013 with whom Burkett shared a 1-year-old daughter \u2013 was charged with her murder. The following day, Beard's fianc\u00e9e Holly Elkins voluntarily sat down with two detectives at the Carrollton Police Department.",
      "\"I wanted to use her as a witness in this. And if she had information that could put her in that witness column and not in the suspect column, I was gonna listen to her,\" Det. Jeremy Chevallier told correspondent Peter Van Sant in \"The Plot to Eliminate Alyssa Burkett,\"\u00a0an all-new \"48 Hours\" airing \u00a0Saturday, Nov. 16 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Elkins told Chevallier and Sgt. Michael Harding she was convinced they had the wrong man. \"I can't believe my fianc\u00e9 would do something like that to a woman, or to anybody \u2026\" she said.",
      "And Elkins also said she was willing to help if she could: \"I just feel bad to not help something that I think is very sad that happened \u2026 I feel conflicted morally because I want to help, but I don't have anything \u2026\"",
      "But there was one thing Elkins was adamant about \u2013 Beard was home with her the morning Burkett was killed. \"\u2026 if I had any reasonable reason to believe that Andrew left that house and did it, I would give it to you. I would, I would, I promise,\" Elkins told detectives.",
      "\"At first it seemed like an open-and-shut case,\" Chevallier told \"48 Hours.\" He would later discover \"Andrew Beard was only half of the story.\"",
      "On the morning of Oct. 2, 2020, Burkett parked outside the Greentree Apartments leasing office when a man in a black Ford Expedition pulled into the spot next to her. He got out of his SUV and shot Burkett through the driver's side window.",
      "Assuming she was dead, the shooter began driving away, but Burkett was still alive. As she got out of her car and ran towards her office, the assailant \u2014 who several eyewitnesses described as a Black man \u2014 got back out of his car and chased Burkett with a hunting knife. He stabbed and slashed her 44 times before he fled for good. When Burkett's mother, Teresa Collard, arrived at the scene, she immediately gave investigators a name: Andrew Beard.",
      "In the months leading up to her death, Burkett and Beard, who was 33 at the time, had been involved in a bitter custody battle over their daughter, Willow. After Willow was born in July 2019, Beard filed for primary custody of the baby. \"Andrew, he made more money than [Alyssa] \u2026 She was afraid that \u2026 he wanted Willow, and he was gonna get her,\" Burkett's younger sister Madison Grimes told Van Sant.",
      "Finally, in the spring of 2020, things between Burkett and Beard seemed to calm down after they came to an agreement on visitation with Willow and child support. Beard had also started dating Holly Elkins, and Burkett's family said she was happy that Beard had found someone new.",
      "But the peace between Beard and Burkett would be disrupted when he started demanding primary custody of Willow again. Burkett also couldn't shake this uneasy feeling that she was being watched, and she told her family that Beard always seemed to know where she was. \"Every day you feel like you're having to watch over your shoulder ... That's how I felt she lived,\" Collard told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Within hours of Burkett's murder, police pulled Beard over in his F-150 pickup truck with Elkins and Willow inside. Police seized his truck and told Beard and Elkins that they could leave, but they couldn't return home. Later that night, police searched Beard's home and found GPS tracker batteries and charging stations that matched a tracking device detectives discovered under Burkett's car earlier that day.",
      "The next day, police searched Beard's F-150 pickup and uncovered two bottles of dark foundation \u2014 makeup investigators believed Beard used to disguise himself as a Black man on the morning of the murder. Later that night, police located that black Ford SUV the assailant drove to the scene. It was found abandoned less than a mile from Beard's house.",
      "On Oct. 5, 2020, Beard surrendered at the Carrollton Police Department and was charged with murder. He spent two weeks behind bars before he was released on bond. Chevallier said he was worried about baby Willow's safety, so he reached out to the federal government to take the case under federal firearm laws.",
      "Because an unregistered silencer was found during the search of Beard's home, the federal government agreed to take the case. Eight days after he bonded out, Beard was rearrested and ultimately charged with cyberstalking using a dangerous weapon resulting in death.",
      "In June 2022, Beard pleaded guilty. One month later, he spoke with the FBI as part of a plea deal, and he had a lot to say \u2014 especially when it came to Elkins' role in the plot to kill Burkett. \"\u2026 It was \u2026'this is how you're gonna do this,' it was, '\u2026 you're gonna wear this dark makeup \u2026' That was her plan \u2026 that's how it's gonna be done,\" Beard told the FBI.",
      "Investigators soon realized that the Holly Elkins who told detectives, \"I want to help, I really do. But I don't have any answers \u2026\" just four days after Burkett's murder, had given the performance of her life. \"She was the one running the show \u2026 she was telling him what he was gonna do \u2026\" Chevallier told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Investigators dug back into text messages between Elkins and Beard, which revealed Elkins' true feelings about Burkett. \"She hated Alyssa with a burning passion,\" Harding told Van Sant.",
      "One week before the murder, Elkins texted Beard while she was away on a trip in Mexico and wrote, \"I hope you handle it I'm not coming home to b***s***.\" Beard responded, \"That's my goal.\"",
      "During his interview, Beard explained to investigators: \"I just basically said, 'OK' and became submissive to whatever she wanted me to do, that's the task I did.\"",
      "After speaking with Beard, the FBI spent about a year building a compelling case against Elkins. And in the eyes of the investigators, Elkins was just as culpable for Burkett's death as Beard. \"I 100% believe that if Holly and Andrew had never met that Alyssa Burkett would be alive today,\" Harding told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "In May 2023, Beard was sentenced to 43 years in federal prison. Investigators believed Elkins thought the case was over. \"I think she believed that the further she got away from this, the less involved she was gonna be,\" Chevallier said. \"But it didn't work out for her.\"",
      "Two months after Beard was sentenced, Elkins was arrested by federal agents at the Miami airport after returning from a trip to the Dominican Republic. She was charged with conspiracy to stalk and stalking using a dangerous weapon resulting in death. Elkins pleaded not guilty.",
      "In April 2024, Elkins went on trial as a co-conspirator where one of the federal prosecutors put it like this: \"Andrew Beard was a monster, but he was Holly Elkins' monster,\" Harding told \"48 Hours.\" After a one-week trial, the case went to the jury. Jurors deliberated for about 90 minutes and returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Three months later, she was sentenced to two life terms \u2014 much longer than Beard's sentence.",

    "story": [
      "When astronomy fans look to the sky this week, they'll get to see November's Beaver full moon, the last of 2024's four consecutive supermoons.",
      "The 2024 series of supermoons started in August with a rare supermoon blue moon. After this month's Beaver Moon, there won't be another supermoon until late next year.",
      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",

      "During this month's supermoon, the moon will be about 224,385 miles from Earth.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:14:51 -0500",
    "summary": "A recess appointment would allow Trump to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general is his most controversial Cabinet pick yet, and the Florida Republican is likely to face obstacles in the confirmation process.",
      "But Trump is seeking an important change to the Senate confirmation process that would allow him to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote, in which nominees need a majority vote to be confirmed.",
      "Before Senate Republicans elected their leaders for the upcoming 119th Congress, Trump demanded that the candidates agree to recess appointments, which would give him the option of bypassing the Senate's role of approving or rejecting the president's nominations. Trump argued that without the ability to temporarily install nominees he would not be able to fill the positions in a timely manner.",
      "The legal basis for recess appointments emanates from a constitutional clause that gives the president \"the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\" A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 concluded that recess appointments could only be made when the Senate is not in session for 10 or more days, after President Barack Obama made controversial appointments when senators were on break.",
      "Senators often leave Washington for long stretches of time, but have utilized pro forma sessions to prevent presidents from installing nominees without their consent.",
      "\"In recent years, the Senate \u2014 regardless of which party controlled it \u2014 has used pro forma sessions to ensure that it is never in recess for more than three days,\" said Josh Chafetz, a law and politics professor at Georgetown University.",
      "For Trump to make recess appointments, the Senate would have to agree, through a simple majority vote, to go on recess for at least 10 days. The House must also agree to allow the Senate to adjourn, but Chavetz says if the House does not agree, or if it disagrees with the Senate on the length of adjournment, then the president has the constitutional power to adjourn both chambers for a timeframe of his choosing.",
      "\"That second route has never been used before in U.S. history, so no one is quite sure how it would work,\" Chafetz said.",
      "A recess appointment, however, does not have the same benefits as a nominee confirmed by the Senate. Without Senate approval, the appointee would not be paid. The appointee can serve in the role for up to two years, depending on when the appointment was made. After that, the individual could be installed again through a recess appointment or the regular confirmation process.",
      "Some senators, including Republicans who will be in the majority come January, showed little appetite for giving up their constitutional power, especially after Trump announced that he intended to nominate Gaetz to lead the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Wednesday. \"If the president proceeds with that nominee, I think it shows the importance of having the Senate advice and consent process.\"",
      "\"I have concerns that he can't get across the finish line, and we're going to spend a lot of political capital,\" Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters Thursday. \"I say we. A lot of people will spend a lot of political capital on something that, that even if they got done, you'd have to wonder if it was worth it.\"",
      "Cramer added that Gaetz has \"got a really steep hill to climb to get lots of votes, including mine.\"",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday after Trump announced his selection. The timing came days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct. Gaetz was also the subject of a previous Justice Department investigation that sought to determine if he violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws. No charges were filed, and Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday when asked by reporters about Gaetz. \"That's a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the Judiciary Committee in doing that vetting and advice and consent.\"",
      "\"I don't think we should be circumventing the Senate's responsibilities, but I think it's premature to be talking about recess appointments,\" Cornyn added.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for conducting confirmation hearings for the attorney general nominee. Several other Judiciary Committee members also weighed in Thursday.",
      "\"The bottom line is our responsibility in the Senate is advice and consent,\" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee chairman.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said recess appointments should be used \"judiciously,\" adding that he has concerns about \"blanket recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said he could name between \"five to 10 Republicans who are seriously considering voting against\" Gaetz \"and insisting that there will be a vote.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri indicated he would not have an issue if Trump made recess appointments, saying the president \"has total authority to make recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware urged his Republican colleagues to protect their role in confirmations and encourage Trump to pick confirmable candidates.",

      "Active duty service members who died by suicide in 2023 were largely enlisted males under the age of 30, accounting for 61% of suicides. The most common method of suicide was firearms, at 65%, followed by hanging or asphyxiation, at 28%.",
      "Defense officials said the suicide rates were similar to rates across the U.S. population between 2011 and 2022.",
      "\"We are not immune to the factors that drive suicide throughout the U.S., and our service members face, in addition to those, a number of unique military challenges,\" Hoyt said.",
      "He added recommendations from the Suicide Prevention Response and Independent Review Committee have given a \"mechanism by which we can address as many of those potential risks as possible and make investments in those spaces.\"",
      "The Pentagon set up the review committee to provide recommendations to reduce suicide deaths\u00a0in the military. Last year the committee made a series of recommendations, including broadly improving the delivery of mental health care, addressing stigma and other barriers to care and revising suicide prevention training.",

      "The Pentagon expects to spend about $250 million on suicide prevention in fiscal year 2025, the largest amount of funds the Defense Department has ever invested, Hoyt told reporters.",
      "\"A lot of the time where we've done initiatives during the past two decades, there's been insufficient investment in making sure that those have staying power, that we've got a long-term implementation of those programs,\" Hoyt said.",
      "The total number of suicides across the force, including both active duty and reserve, was 523 in 2023 compared to 493 in 2022.",

He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "Kennedy has a long record of criticizing vaccines, including spreading misleading claims about their safety.",
      "He has vowed to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy has claimed a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity. He has also urged removing fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. His odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called\u00a0\"anti-science, fringe public health stances,\"\u00a0but with\u00a0Republicans in the majority\u00a0come January, Trump's nominees will have an easier path to confirmation.",
      "Despite the expected opposition to Kennedy's nomination \u2014 along with other controversial choices to lead national security agencies and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department \u2014 Trump has told associates in recent days he is standing by his pick for health chief.",
      "\"No one can talk him out of it,\" one of the sources familiar with the pick said Thursday.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign to let Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic and former environmental lawyer, \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food.

      "The sprawling HHS Department encompasses a number of agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.

      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that often clashes with the FDA and in some ways is closely aligned with Kennedy's calls to get chemicals out of foods, put out a statement condemning his nomination.",
      "\"Nominating an anti-vaxxer like Kennedy to HHS is like putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA,\" the group's president, Dr. Peter G. Lurie, said in a statement. \"CSPI opposes this nomination and any other nominees who are a direct threat to science and evidence-based solutions.\"",
      "But one prominent Democrat, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, said in a social media post that he was \"excited by the news\" of Kennedy's nomination. He praised Kennedy for helping to defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 but said he hoped that Kennedy would embrace personal choice on vaccines, rather than banning them. He also said he was optimistic about Kennedy's vow to take on big pharma and high drug costs for Americans. Polis also backed Kennedy's criticism of \"entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA\" that \"are not doing their job, they're not protecting our kids,\" in particular from pesticides used in agriculture.",
      "Polis later clarified his praise, saying, \"Science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation's health policy and the science-backed decision to get vaccinated improves public health and safety.\"",
      "At the same time, Polis has also launched a policy entity with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker aimed at taking on other parts of the Trump agenda.",

      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" Reddy said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",

      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",

      "The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative Japanese prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royal family members who marry commoners to lose their royal status. That rule came into effect relatively recently, when Princess Mako married her non-royal fianc\u00e9 Kei Komuro in October 2021, promptly shedding her royal title and trappings \u2014 and depriving the shrinking imperial family of another member.",

    "summary": "Named after Hamburg's St. Pauli district, the club is known among soccer fans for its left-leaning supporter base.",
    "story": [
      "A German soccer club is leaving X because of the increase in hate speech and disinformation on the social media platform that it claims could undermine the snap elections in the country.",
      "FC St. Pauli announced the decision on Thursday, saying billionaire owner Elon Musk has turned the platform into a \"hate machine\" since he took over the company in 2022.",
      "\"Racism and conspiracy theories are allowed to spread unchecked and even curated,\" St. Pauli said in a statement. \"Insults and threats are seldom sanctioned and are sold as freedom of speech.\"",
      "The club said it had already limited posts on X and increased \"political statements in support of diversity and inclusion to make a stand against hate.\"",
      "Named after Hamburg's St. Pauli district, the club, which plays in the Bundesliga, is known among soccer fans for its left-leaning supporter base. Fan groups often chant anti-racist slogans and promote diversity within the club.",
      "St. Pauli also underlined Musk's role in last week's U.S. presidential election, and alleged his platform could affect the outcome of the snap elections in Germany, which are scheduled to take place next February, by \"manipulating the public discourse.\"",
      "\"Musk was a major backer of the Trump campaign and also used X for this purpose,\" the club said. \"It is to be assumed that X will also promote authoritarian, misanthropic and far-right content during the forthcoming German election campaign.\"",
      "St. Pauli said it would no longer share content on X but it will not deactivate the account. The club urged supporters to follow its updates on Bluesky, an alternative social media platform that has observed a surge of new members after President-elect Donald Trump's election victory last week.",
      "Musk was a key figure in Trump's third election campaign, donating millions of dollars and promoting content for his message on X. Trump announced this week that he will be part of the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who sought the Republican Party's nomination.",
      "On Nov. 6, the German coalition government collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed the finance minister, who represented the pro-business Free Democratic Party. The chancellor will seek a vote of confidence at the German Bundestag in December.",
      "St. Pauli aims to migrate its nearly 250,000 followers ahead of February's snap elections in Germany in which the center-right opposition Christian Democratic Union is expected to make significant gains.",
      "The far-right Alternative for Germany party has also gained popularity. With 76 seats, it is the fifth largest party in the Bundestag. In September's Thuringian state election, the AfD became the first far-right party in Germany to have won an election since World War II.",

    "summary": "Tropical Storm Sara developed in the Caribbean on Thursday, threatening parts of Central America with life-threatening and potentially catastrophic rain.",
    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Sara formed in the Caribbean on Thursday, becoming the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The system, previously called Tropical Depression 19, developed in the western Caribbean earlier this week and intensified while traveling westward on a path toward Central America.",
      "Sara had sustained winds of 45 mph and was located around 105 miles north-northwest of the Nicaragua-Honduras border and 105 miles east-southeast of the Honduras island of Guanaja, moving west at 10 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said\u00a0in a 10 p.m. ET update. A weather system is considered a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph.",
      "The storm is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Sara was forecast to move closer to the northern coast of Honduras through early Saturday and then approach Belize on Sunday, the Hurricane Center said.",
      "Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the hurricane center said they expected \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash floods to hit Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Honduras' northern coast and its Bay Islands were under a tropical storm warning Thursday night.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Air Force hurricane hunters that flew into the area to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system located Sara Thursday night along Hondruras' northeastern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, and the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "\"It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week,\" the hurricane center said Thursday. \"Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.\"",

      "Around 10 minutes after the game kicked off as scheduled at 8:45 p.m. local time, there was scuffle in the top section of the stand behind one of the goals, with some of those involved having Israeli flags draped over their backs. It was not clear what caused the altercation and security intervened after around one minute.",
      "The match finished in a 0-0 draw with no further incidents at Stade de France. However, Israel's national anthem was whistled by some fans when the players lined up and Israel players were jeered at times when they got the ball.",
      "Chants of \"Israel, Israel\" could he heard from visiting fans for several minutes before the final whistle.",
      "French police chief Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said 4,000 police officers and security staff were deployed in and around the stadium, with another 1,500 police on public transport.",
      "Several buses carrying Israel fans arrived under police escort and some were waving flags inside the stadium. Less than 20,000 of 80,000 tickets were sold, with around 150 Israel supporters present.",
      "Security forces were on high alert in Paris ahead of the match. Israel's team bus arrived at the stadium shortly after 7 p.m. local time. Around one hour before kickoff, Nu\u00f1ez visited the stadium's video surveillance facilities along with French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.",
      "Three months after hosting the\u00a0Olympic closing ceremony, the atmosphere has gone from festive to fearful. French President Emmanuel Macron and Retailleau was present, along with former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy.",
      "Thousands of protesters marched Wednesday night to voice their opposition to Israel's ongoing war in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, including 46-year-old Nacim Bordiah, who said France \"should be boycotting the match.\"",

      "The march was peaceful, but tension was running high on the heels of antisemitic violence last week on the streets of Amsterdam following a game between Israeli and Dutch teams.",
      "Among the Israeli fans who came to support Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam, there were some who marched through the streets before the game chanting \"death to Arabs\" and tore down a Palestinian flag. But after the match, mobs cornered Israeli fans and bystanders, beating and kicking them and throwing one into a canal.",
      "Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema condemned the violence, saying in its wake that \"Jewish Israeli supporters were hunted down and attacked via anti-Semitic calls on social media and on the streets.\"",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the violence as a \"terrible antisemitic attack\" and declared himself \"deeply ashamed\" for the country's capital city, while his Israeli and American counterparts, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden, also voiced disgust and horror at the attacks targeting Jews.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Mayor Halsema said \"a more complete picture\" had emerged of the clashes that gripped Amsterdam last week, \"and all sorts of terrible things happened,\" but she stressed that it \"in no way negates\" that a call had been issued in her city for a \"hunt for Jews.\"",
      "Clashes have persisted since then, despite a temporary ban on demonstrations in Amsterdam, with police breaking up one protest that sought to defy the ban as recently as Wednesday evening. A train in Amsterdam was also attacked, with one man shouting, \"cancer Jew!\"",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that authorities demolishing illegally-constructed homes and other properties belonging to suspected criminals is unconstitutional and must cease. The practice is allegedly used widely by several state governments to punish suspects outside the court justice process, and is commonly known as \"bulldozer justice.\"",
      "\"The executive can't become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him by demolishing his properties. Such an act would be transgressing [the] executive's limits,\" the court said in a 95-page judgement.",
      "The court issued its ruling in response to several petitions over a spate of home demolitions targeting suspected criminals in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent years. Critics have accused the BJP state administrations of using bulldozer justice primarily to\u00a0target Muslims \u2014 an accusation the party has repeatedly denied.",
      "BJP state officials have argued that due process of law has been followed in carrying out the demolitions, but the court said authorities had adopted a \"pick and choose\" attitude toward illegally constructed homes, singling out those belonging to Muslims suspected of other crimes while sparing similar, but non-Muslim-owned illegal dwellings in the same area.",
      "\"In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before the initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure, but an action of penalizing the accused without even trying him before the court of law,\" the court said.",
      "One of the petitions to the Supreme Court was filed over the April 2022 demolition of dozens of homes belonging largely to Muslims following sectarian clashes in Delhi's Jahangirpuri neighborhood, which drew allegations of religious discrimination and extrajudicial punishment.",
      "\"The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building\u2026 reminds one of a lawless state of affairs,\" Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan said in the court's Wednesday judgment. \"Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law.\"",
      "The court warned state authorities it would take action against officials found guilty of \"such highhanded and arbitrary\" actions and issued detailed guidelines for the demolition of homes constructed without the required permits.",
      "The new guidelines make it mandatory for authorities to give at least 15 days' advance notice to an occupant before an illegal home is demolished and to explain the reason for the building being razed.",
      "The new guidelines state that occupiers of such properties must be given sufficient time to either remove the construction or challenge the demolition order in a court.",

      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",

    "summary": "Scientists say they've discovered a \"mega coral\" three times bigger than the previous record holder - so huge they initially thought it was a shipwreck.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",
      "\"We want the world to know, that this is a special place, and it needs to be protected,\" he told the BBC. \"We rely mostly on marine resources for economic survival, so coral is very, very important.\"",

Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, which explains how the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "This system's strength is determined based on how much fuel it has \u2014 factors such as being in a favorable environment over warm waters, low wind shear, no intercepting fronts \u2014 and how long it remains in those favorable conditions. No matter its strength, the forecast models have it lingering in the western Caribbean through the weekend before turning to the north and into the Gulf of Mexico early next week.",

      "Moore, a freelance journalist, traveled to Somalia in 2012 to research piracy and the nation's economy. On January 21, he was kidnapped by multiple heavily armed men and transported him to a secluded area, where he was held captive along with two fishermen from the Seychelles. Moore was moved several times over the course of three months, then transported to a hijacked boat, the F/V Naham III. Moore and one of the fishermen were held captive there, along with 28 crew members, for several more months, according to the Department of Justice. The fisherman was tortured, and the crew members told Moore that the pirates had killed the ship's captain when they hijacked the vessel, prosecutors said.",
      "Moore remained a hostage for another two years, continuously shuffled between safehouses, kept under armed guard and chained at night to prevent escape, prosecutors said. He was repeatedly threatened, according to the Department of Justice, and forced to make proof-of-life videos requesting large ransom payments. In 2014, negotiators paid a ransom of $1.6 million to secure Moore's release. Moore has said his family funded the ransom payment, and published a book about his experience in 2018.",

That meant he was in charge of police and security forces, but he also \"served as an overall leader of the pirates,\" according to the Department of Justice. He \"headed their efforts to extort a massive ransom from Moore's aging mother,\" the department said, and directed the production of the proof-of-life videos and participated in ransom negotiations. He also used his home as a base of operations for the pirates, the Department of Justice said. He was arrested in Minneapolis in 2019.",
      "Tahlil, also of Mogadishu, served in the nation's army and was a supervisor of the pirates who guarded Moore during the early months of his time in captivity. He used his military position, training and experience \"to serve as the pirates' head of security and armorer,\" according to the Department of Justice, and was in charge of moving Moore from location to location. He also provided and repaired weapons used to keep Moore in captivity. Tahlil was jailed in New York City in 2018.",

      "\"Fluoride is an element that in some places can be found\u00a0naturally in water and may also be added by drinking water systems to promote strong teeth and prevent tooth decay, especially in children,\" the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told Fox News Digital in a statement.",

      "Potentially harmful effects",
      "Many communities across the world \u2013 more than 240 \u2013 choose not to fluorinate their drinking water, reports show.",
      "A recent review published in Cochrane Reviews found that adding the mineral to water may have only a slight benefit against tooth decay because people now brush with toothpaste containing fluoride.",

      "Lee said he agreed with Trump's promises to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, echoing the president-elect's concern over the federal bureaucracy becoming entrenched with gender and race ideology rather than learning.",
      "\"I think it is a great idea to dismantle the Department of Education federally. And I'm a strong believer that policy at the state level should be handled by states, that states know best,\" Lee told Fox News Digital. \"In this case, states certainly know best. We know best in Tennessee what our children need and how best to educate our kids. The parents of this state should be given a greater influence on how their kids are educated, and that will happen if the federal Department of Education is dismantled and those funds are delivered to states to be used in a more efficient and more effective way.\"",
      "Lee said the political environment on the ground in the state is not what it was months ago when the first school choice proposal failed in the state legislature. Since then, the election saw a wave of pro-school choice candidates win at the state-level, and Trump succeeded in his bid for the White House.",

      "\"President Trump has long believed that school choice is important for the people of this country and that education freedom is something that all Americans could have. He's talked about it. He campaigned on it,\" Lee said. \"One thing is very evident about what happened last week. And President Trump is very clear about what his policies are, and Americans were very clear about their acceptance of those policies last week. They, with a strong mandate, said we like what we hear. We want him to execute on those things and that President Trump has a significant understanding and a clear understanding and is the leader, frankly, on the issue of school choice. All of those things benefit us as we move into this next session.\"",
      "Lee's new school choice bill, titled the Education Freedom Act of 2025, was jointly introduced to the state House and Senate on Wednesday.",
      "Drawing from funding already approved by the state legislature, the bill would allow the state Department of Education to award up to 20,000 scholarships \u2013 valued at about $7,000 each \u2013 for the next school year to be spent on tuition, tutoring, technology and examination expenses. The first 10,000 scholarships would be set aside for low-income students whose parents might not otherwise afford to send their children to institutions other than the public schools in their districts.",
      "Democrats have painted school choice as disenfranchising low-income students, but Lee said he feels the opposite.",
      "\"Every kid is unique. Every kid has different learning styles. Every kid has a different life situation. And every family ought to have the opportunity to choose the best path for their kid,\" the governor said. \"In particular, I don't think that only the wealthy families that can afford a private option, that those families should be the only ones and those children should be the only ones that have that option for choice.\"",

      "\"Oftentimes, opponents will say that school choice initiatives hurt public schools. I think that's just the opposite,\" Lee said. \"This legislation that we're actually bringing forth is an education policy initiative. It's not just an Education Freedom Scholarship bill. It includes historic funding for public schools, bonuses for teachers, for public school teachers. We will include alongside with this legislation a teacher pay raise plan that will put us in the top 15 states for teacher pay raise in the country.\"",

      "\"Americans are in growing numbers, and now the majority of Americans, as evidenced by the past elections, have come to believe that school choice is the way of the future,\" Lee said. \"It is the answer to challenging the status quo. It is the way that we take America's rankings and educational outcomes that used to be the top in the world from way down the list as it relates to other countries back up into the outcomes that we hope for this country.\"",
      "\"This is a way to challenge and change and bring innovation into an education system that's grown stale and bloated and bureaucratic,\" Lee said. \"And we see it happening all across America. We believe it's going to happen in Tennessee. It is an incredibly important moment in our country for parental rights and for the future of children and their education.\"",
      "Lee said his schooling growing up in Tennessee happened before the U.S. Department of Education was established in 1979.",
      "\"We knew how to do it then. We know how to do it now,\" Lee said, explaining that Tennessee created a funding formula that \"uniquely recognizes the needs of children with disabilities, with dyslexia and with English as a second language. \"We know how to fund education for Tennessee children. We know much better than they do in a bureaucratic institution like the federal Department of Education. I think President Trump is exactly right. I think it's a great idea.\"",

      "With Cabinet nominations underway, Fox News Digital asked Lee who he would like to see as Trump's education secretary and if the governor would consider throwing his own name in the running.",
      "\"What I will say is and what I hope is that whoever takes this job is looking to work themselves out of a job,\" Lee said. \"It will take the right kind of leader who really understands, and I think, who really understands how states can function and how problematic for states federal bureaucracies are. Governors understand that. There are a lot of folks who would be well-qualified for this, but the next person needs to be hoping to work themselves out of a job.\"",

      "\"We can have the best public schools in America,\" Lee said. \"We can commit the right amount of finances and the right amount of focus. We can strengthen and support our public schools in unprecedented ways and provide freedom and opportunity for parents and choice. At the same time, those are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they shouldn't be. We should improve every educational opportunity for every kid in our state and will do so through this legislation.\"",

They go as far as to change the contact information of the email sender to something legitimate like an actual helpdesk or IT department or business.",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",
      "3. Malware distribution: They will often have buttons, links or attachments included in the email. If you click the attachment, it can download malware or a virus to your device. If you click on a link that's provided in the email, it might take you to a website that will collect your personal and financial information or download malware or viruses to your device.",

Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",

      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",

      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",
      "4) Verify suspicious requests:\u00a0If you get an unexpected email asking for sensitive info, contact the sender directly through an official channel to confirm the request.",

But now, since scammers can even access government emails, you need to be extra cautious.

    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",
      "Image of military personnel supporting one another (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "With cybercriminals lurking around every corner, protecting your identity and finances can feel daunting. But what if I told you that a VPN could be your secret weapon?",
      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi. VPNs also prevent third parties from tracking your online activities, reducing the risk of personal data being harvested for malicious purposes.",

      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cell phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Practical tips for using VPNs effectively",

      "2. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Combine the use of a VPN with strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance security. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",

      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",

      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly.

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",

      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "The University of Rochester said hundreds of \"wanted\" posters seeking Jewish members of faculty were found posted around campus in recent days.",
      "In an update Wednesday, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) said it believes all the wanted posters, found in buildings across campus, including classroom spaces, have been removed, but anyone who finds more should contact the department.",
      "DPS Chief Quchee Collins said in a statement that the department has identified \"several persons of interest,\" including \"current students, individuals whose current enrollment status is unclear, and other individuals,\" as it continues to investigate the incident.",
      "The posters reportedly listed Jewish faculty members, including senior university leaders and members of the Board of Trustees, saying they are \"wanted\" for alleged \"war crimes,\" as the Israeli military continues its operation against Hamas terrorists in Gaza launched in response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Some posters accused those Jewish faculty members of \"ethnic cleansing\" and encouraging the \"displacement of Palestinians,\" or of perpetuating \"racism\" and \"hate speech,\" USA Today reported.",
      "\"I want to be as clear as I can that the University of Rochester strongly denounces the recent display of 'wanted' posters targeting senior university leaders and members of our faculty, staff, and Board of Trustees,\" University President Sarah Mangelsdorf said in a statement Tuesday. \"This act is disturbing, divisive, and intimidating and runs counter to our values as a university.\"",

      "\"Furthermore, several of those depicted appear to have been targeted because they are members of our Jewish community. We view this as antisemitism, which will not be tolerated at our University,\" she added. \"This isn\u2019t who we are. This goes against everything we stand for and we have an obligation to reject it.\"",
      "DPS said it was first made aware on Sunday night that \"hundreds\" of posters depicting members of the university community as \"wanted\" were posted around campus and \"immediately began working to remove the posters and return the spaces to their usual state.\" The department said the removal process \"is painstaking because of the strong adhesive used to affix the posters, which in some cases caused damage to walls, floors, chalkboards, and other surfaces.\"",
      "Collins said Wednesday that DPS has reached out to the individuals depicted on the posters to offer \"additional safety support and resources.\"",
      "Among those listed on the posters was James Newell, who retired in August as the university's assistant security director, USA Today reported. Newell said he believes he was targeted in connection to the arrest of a University of Rochester student in December 2023 who allegedly punched a school officer attempting to disperse an unauthorized anti-Israel campus protest. However, Newell said, he was at the security office when the arrest took place.",
      "The posters also depicted Joy Getnick, a member of the Hillel at the University of Rochester, who told WHEC-TV that such signage spreads \"harmful antisemitic ideas about the Jewish people and about Israel.\"",
      "Anti-Israel protesters sit in the Wilson Quadrangle at the University of Rochester on April 23, 2024. (Jeffrey Meehan/Democrat and Chronicle / USA TODAY NETWORK)",

      "\"We are continuing to pursue all available leads, and we are working diligently to gather and analyze all relevant evidence to ensure a thorough investigation,\" Collins said Wednesday. \"It is the intention of my office to identify and apprehend those whom our investigation determines to be involved in this incident and to ensure these individuals are turned over to the appropriate criminal justice and/or University conduct processes.\"",
      "\"As President Mangelsdorf stated, this behavior cannot and will not be tolerated at our University,\" the chief added. \"The safety and well-being of our campus community remains our highest priority.\"",

Public Safety continues to monitor all parts of the University while continuing our investigation, and we are available to provide an immediate response to anyone who is concerned with their safety.\"",

      "The number of malign attacks against the U.S. \u2013 incidents that include projectile strikes, maritime aggression, major cyber intrusions and hacking, kidnappings or wrongful detentions, and terrorist attacks \u2013 began to increase after the U.S. 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal under the first Trump administration, then throughout President Biden\u2019s term.",
      "After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran-backed groups have not only levied increasing fire at Washington\u2019s top ally in the Middle East, but also its troops in Iraq and Syria as well as U.S. naval vessels targeted by Houthi terrorists in Yemen.",

      "As Israel continued to ramp up its offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and prepare for its promised retaliatory attack against Tehran in late October, Iran-backed groups in turn increased their attacks against U.S. troops in neighboring nations.",
      "\"As it has done in the past, Iran could also further escalate its proxies\u2019 attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria to try to convince Washington to exert pressure on Israel so that it stops degrading these terrorist groups,\" Cicurel told Fox News Digital.",
      "Militia groups in Syria more than doubled the number of attacks levied at U.S. personnel in 15 separate incidents compared to the seven attacks Iran-backed groups carried out in September. Though the figure is still just half the number of attacks levied in January when some 34 strikes targeted U.S. personnel in Syria along with 19 in Iraq.",
      "Cicurel clarified for Fox News Digital that these strikes are by organizations like the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is an \"umbrella mechanism for Iran\u2019s proxies\" and includes terrorist groups likes Kataib Hezbollah, Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, to claim attacks against Israel and U.S. forces.\"",

      "But according to the JINSA report, prior to the October 2023 attacks by Hamas, Iran-sanctioned militant groups opted to target U.S. troops over Israeli positions because \"Iranian-linked groups determined that the U.S. responses would be less forceful than Israel\u2019s.\"",
      "That strategy halted after the Hamas attack on Israel, and in October this year alone Iran-backed groups launched more than 110 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), missiles and rockets at Israel from Iraq.",
      "\"Leveraging its Iraqi proxies to fire at Israel was likely a means for Iran to increase fire against the Jewish state without triggering the retaliation on Iranian territory that its direct attacks have incurred,\" Cicurel said.",

      "Israel also saw at least 111 UAVs, missiles and rockets thrown at it from Iran-backed groups in Iraq last month, which is more than 2.5 times the number of attacks from Iraq than in September and likely a strong motivator for the strike that Israel carried out in Iraq and Syria during its retaliatory strike against Tehran late last month.",

      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\"",
      "XI JINPING WARNS TRUMP US WOULD 'LOSE FROM CONFRONTATION' WITH CHINA AS RENEWED TRADE WAR LOOMS",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",

      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Satellite images and public documents helped identify likely carrier project",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, conventionally powered Chinese aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong carry out a dual aircraft carrier formation exercise for the first time in the South China Sea in late October 2024. (Chen Mengxi/Xinhua via AP)",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",

(Pu Haiyang/Xinhua via AP)",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's third conventionally powered aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducts a maiden sea trial on May 7, 2024. (Ding Ziyu/Xinhua via AP, File)",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 12:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "What Biden laws and executive actions Donald Trump could undo, including on immigration, student loan forgiveness and transgender rights.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Joe Biden relinquishes power in January, some parts of his legacy will be secure, while others may be undone by President-elect Donald Trump and a new Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "The pieces of Biden\u2019s legacy go into four buckets. Trump can easily undo executive actions on matters like immigration and transgender rights, while a Republican Congress can unravel spending programs passed by Democrats on a partisan basis. But it will be difficult for Trump to undo bipartisan legislation, such as measures about infrastructure and preventing gun violence, and the judges Biden appointed can\u2019t be unseated.",
      "Republican lawmakers told NBC News they expect Trump to quickly undo many of Biden\u2019s executive actions and the GOP-controlled Congress to use the budget process to roll back some of his spending measures, including parts of one of the signature achievements of his administration, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Executive actions (most at risk)",
      "In his almost four years in office, Biden has taken executive action on border security and keeping migrant families together to abortion access, birth control and protecting LGBTQ rights. His programs forgiving billions of dollars in federal student loan debt face an uncertain future after Trump ran against them.",
      "Biden\u2019s immigration orders are ripe for Trump to target after he ran on a platform of mass deportations and clamping down on border security. In June, Biden signed an executive action to temporarily shut down asylum requests once the average number of daily encounters tops 2,500 between official ports of entry, which Trump may seek to supersede with one of his own.\u00a0The same month, a second Biden order allowed undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens to apply for legal status without leaving the country if they've lived in the U.S. for 10 years or more.",
      "Biden also took executive action to ensure women have access to reproductive health care when they travel across state lines for medical care, including abortions, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And his administration proposed a rule just last month that would provide women with private insurance access to over-the-counter birth control at no cost.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he expects Trump to move \u201cvery fast\u201d to undo Biden\u2019s executive orders on issues like immigration and transgender rights, which Biden instructed his administration to protect in a 2022 executive order.",
      "\u201cThe border legacy is an unmitigated disaster,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cThose are all issues that cost Kamala Harris the election. That\u2019s the disconnect with their party, with real people.\u201d",
      "Spending and tax policies (in real danger)",
      "Republicans are preparing to move quickly to craft a party-line bill that would extend Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and undo some of Biden\u2019s achievements, most notably provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The consumer benefits in the IRA include a $7,500 credit to buy certain electric vehicles, credits for home energy efficiency and Obamacare subsidies that capped insurance premiums for many middle-class people.",
      "\u201cEverything in the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan is potentially on the table,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the Finance Committee. \"Having said that, I do believe that there are policies there that we should look at the merits, once they\u2019ve been passed. But there are billions and billions of dollars that were misspent in both of those bills, and I\u2019m going to support repurposing them to support the TCJA 2025.\u201d",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who's in line to chair the Environment and Public Works Committee, said she has the IRA\u2019s climate change provisions in her sights.",
      "\u201cThe IRA is certainly something we\u2019re going to be taking a look at. And so other than that, I think committee chairs are starting to meet together to start to discuss this.\"",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said Republicans may not extend the Obamacare subsidies, which expire next year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know about that one,\u201d he said.",
      "Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., said there will be no sacred cows when House Republicans look to slash spending.",
      "\"We will try and find savings wherever we can,\" he said.",
      "Bipartisan Biden-era bills (largely safe)",
      "The parts of Biden\u2019s legacy that will be relatively safe are the bipartisan laws he passed, which are subject to filibusters and therefore give Democrats the power to protect them. GOP senators, including the newly elected majority leader, John Thune, of South Dakota, insist they will preserve the legislative filibuster while they're in charge.",
      "Those achievements include the CHIPS and Science Act and the infrastructure law, which have created jobs in domestic industry and construction projects; the Safer Communities Act to modestly tighten gun laws; the Respect for Marriage Act to codify legal same-sex marriage; a Postal Service reform law; and an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act to prevent a future presidential candidate from trying to use Congress to overturn an election.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll come after the IRA. CHIPS And Science, I think, is probably OK because it was bipartisan,\u201d\u00a0said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with Democrats.",
      "Republicans will have 52 or 53 votes in the Senate, depending on the outcome of a race in Pennsylvania that is heading to a recount. It's not clear they'll have an appetite to repeal the recent bipartisan laws, which some in their party shaped and supported. But even if they try, those measures are subject to the 60-vote threshold, which Democrats are certain to use to protect their achievements.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I hope,\u201d King said.",
      "Biden-appointed judges (very safe)",
      "The safest part of Biden's legacy is arguably the most significant: the federal judges he has appointed across district courts and appeals courts and his Supreme Court pick, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate have so far confirmed 215 judges, a unique slate with historic diversity in personal and professional backgrounds, with high shares of former public defenders and civil rights lawyers. Democrats are using the lame duck session, between now and Jan. 3, to grow that number.",
      "The judges are all serving lifetime appointments, meaning Trump and Republicans won't have the power to unseat them."

      "In a post on X, Kennedy said, \"We have a generational opportunity to bring together the greatest minds in science, medicine, industry, and government to put an end to the chronic disease epidemic.\"",
      "During his presidential campaign, Kennedy developed a national profile for his criticism of the Covid vaccines and childhood immunizations. He has claimed that\u00a0vaccines are tied to autism, despite evidence conveyed through studies over decades that have disproven such a claim.",
      "The appointment of Kennedy, 70, to lead HHS ends days of speculation about what health role \u2014 if any \u2014 the former independent presidential candidate-turned-Trump adviser would play in the incoming administration.",
      "Within HHS is a family of health agencies that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Kennedy has claimed Trump \u201cpromised\u201d him \u201ccontrol of the public health agencies.\"",
      "Apart from the HHS role, Kennedy was said to have been considered for a role in tackling obesity and diabetes in kids \u2014 known as \u201cOperation Warp Speed for childhood chronic disease\" \u2014 and Kennedy himself floated the idea of being a White House \"health czar.\" Those roles wouldn't have given him the authority or influence that heading HHS would offer if he is confirmed.",
      "Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, is known for his misleading and false claims about vaccines, including repeated assertions that vaccines are linked to autism, even though for decades numerous studies across several countries have debunked the association. He also founded Children\u2019s Health Defense, a leading anti-vaccine group.",
      "Other people said to have been considered for the role were Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and Trump's former secretary of housing and urban development, and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who once led the state's Department of Health and Hospitals.",
      "The position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "In a statement following Trump's announcement, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician who is the ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said, \u201cRFK Jr. has championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure.\u201d",

      "If Kennedy is confirmed, his role might spell a major shakeup for the federal health agencies, including the FDA, where he has threatened to eliminate entire departments and fire agency employees who wage \"war on public health.\"",
      "A former acting director of the CDC, Dr. Richard Besser, was stunned by the announcement.",

      "NBC News reported Thursday that some FDA staffers were considering quick exits should Kennedy be selected for a prominent health role.",
      "Kennedy has also suggested that he would ban fluoride in drinking water, as well as strip ultra-processed foods from U.S. diets.",
      "In the first administration, Trump tapped former pharmaceutical executive Alex Azar for the top health agency role. Azar replaced the first Trump-appointed health secretary, Tom Price, who resigned over his use of private jets for government business, costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.",

    "summary": "The University of North Texas Health Science Center used alkaline hydrolysis, rather than cremation, to dispose of bodies after dissecting them for research and training.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "State regulators have ordered a Texas medical school to immediately halt its practice of liquefying bodies after using them for training and research.",
      "In a cease-and-desist letter sent Nov. 1 and obtained by NBC News, the Texas Funeral Service Commission said it discovered during an October inspection that the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth had been \u201cunlawfully conducting final dispositions of human remains using alkaline hydrolysis.\u201d",
      "Alkaline hydrolysis, also known as water cremation, is heralded as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional cremation. It uses water, chemicals and heat to rapidly break down a body, leaving behind a liquid that can be poured down the drain and a dry, ash-like residue that can be returned to relatives.",
      "It\u2019s also illegal in Texas, according to the Funeral Commission.",
      "\u201cThis practice is not authorized under Texas state law and constitutes a serious violation of the standards governing the lawful disposition of human remains,\u201d the commission said in the letter to Health Science Center President Dr. Sylvia Trent-Adams.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Health Science Center spokesperson Andy North pointed to a section of Texas administrative code that lists alkaline hydrolysis as an option for disposing of bodies after they have been used for medical research. But the Funeral Commission said that code was invalid and superseded by state law, which only allows for human remains to be cremated or buried. (Water cremations are legal in more than 25 other states.)",
      "The Funeral Commission threatened to fine the Health Science Center body donation program $5,000 per day and revoke its operating license if it didn\u2019t come into compliance within 14 days.",
      "North said the center proactively halted water cremations on Sept. 16.",
      "That was the same day that NBC News published an investigation revealing that the Health Science Center had dissected and studied hundreds of unclaimed bodies without the consent of the dead or their families. Many of the bodies were cut up and leased to other schools, medical technology companies and the Army, which used them to train students and doctors. In response to the investigation, the center suspended its body donation program and fired the officials who ran it.",
      "The Funeral Commission\u2019s discovery raises new ethical and legal questions about the program\u2019s operations. The Health Science Center\u2019s contracts with Dallas and Tarrant counties \u2014 which supplied it with unclaimed bodies \u2014 stipulated that human remains were to be cremated when the program was finished with them.",
      "And consent forms signed by those donating their bodies or the body of a relative to the center also indicated that \u201ccremated remains\u201d would be returned to survivors \u2014 giving no indication that the bodies might instead be dissolved.",
      "It\u2019s likely families wouldn\u2019t have detected the difference. The fine white powder produced by alkaline hydrolysis \u2014 made by pulverizing bone fragments that are left behind after the rest of the body has been dissolved \u2014 resembles ashes.",
      "Dallas and Tarrant county officials did not immediately respond to questions about whether they agreed to allow the Health Science Center to liquefy unclaimed bodies.",
      "Eli Shupe, a bioethicist at the University of Texas at Arlington who previously criticized the center for dissecting unclaimed bodies, said she was shocked when she learned from a reporter that the program had been doing water cremations.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge ethical issue,\u201d Shupe said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as if they took the wishes of the families very seriously.\u201d",
      "North, the Health Science Center spokesperson, did not answer questions about how long the program had been doing water cremations, whether it used that method for all cases or whether it disclosed that possibility to donors or their families.",
      "Budget documents from 2020 indicate the Health Science Center planned to install two alkaline hydrolysis units as part of a broader renovation to keep up with a surge in bodies coming into the program, including unclaimed remains from Dallas and Tarrant counties. Dissolving bodies in-house, instead of paying outside companies to cremate them, was expected to save the center $1 million over five years, the budget documents show.",
      "Attempts to legalize water cremation have fallen short in the Texas Legislature in recent years in the face of opposition from religious groups, including the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops, which has argued that the practice \u201cfails to treat the body with dignity and respect.\u201d Critics were particularly incensed by the image of liquefied bodies being poured into the sewer.",
      "Regardless of legality, Shupe said that if the Health Science Center was doing water cremations without asking for permission, it would reveal a disregard for the wishes of the dead and their survivors.",
      "\u201cIf my Catholic mother had donated her body to this program, and I later learned that this is what had happened to her body, I would be sick,\u201d Shupe said. \u201cI would be devastated. Because it\u2019s not what she would have wanted.\u201d"

      "The sale of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 media empire is a major blow to one of the defining independent media brands that ushered in a new era of fringe thinking, mainstreaming conspiracy theories once banished to the edges of the internet.",
      "And while Jones\u2019 Infowars brand is now owned by the satirical news site The Onion, media researchers and conservative media experts say its legacy will live on thanks to the far-right media ecosystem it helped inspire, which continues to flourish.",
      "\u201cRight-wing media is robust and only becoming more robust,\u201d said A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Alabama who focuses on conservative news. And with some emboldened after Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election win, \u201cthis can be a race to the bottom in terms of misinformation and the radical right.\u201d",
      "The Onion, which has repeatedly lampooned Jones on its website, acquired Infowars on Thursday in a bankruptcy auction with the support of several families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, who successfully sued Jones after he repeatedly called the massacre a hoax.",
      "Infowars\u2019 website was quickly shut down after Jones confirmed during a broadcast on X that The Onion won the auction for assets belonging to his company, Free Speech Systems. He later returned to broadcasting from another studio, telling his audience he was forced to vacate the Infowars facility in Austin, Texas, and needed its help with legal donations to fight the \u201cfake bidding process.\u201d",
      "The Onion said in a statement that it plans to \u201cend Infowars\u2019 relentless barrage of disinformation\u201d and \u201creplace it with The Onion\u2019s relentless barrage of humor for good.\u201d The company is working with the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety, which said it will be the exclusive advertiser on the revamped Infowars site.",
      "Jones, 50, founded Infowars in 1999, first broadcasting from his home before spinning it into a small media empire that grew an audience with his brand of incendiary rhetoric, which over the decades has included calling 9/11 an \u201cinside job\u201d and claiming the government was using chemicals to turn people gay.",
      "But behind the conspiracy-laden comments was an innovative business model that deviated from that of Jones\u2019 contemporary, the conservative talk radio giant Rush Limbaugh.",
      "Jones \u201cwas a pioneer,\u201d said Reece Peck, an associate professor of media culture at the City University of New York-College of Staten Island. \u201cHe was already broadcasting through his website while doing his syndicated talk radio show. When YouTube came on the scene, he leaned in. He was subsequently copied by everyone who came up after him.\u201d",
      "The rise of platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and others that initially had lax moderation rules and embraced algorithmic recommendation systems provided fruitful ground for Jones and a new generation of far-right voices who gained traction especially as they began to coalesce around Trump.",
      "And Trump\u2019s embrace of often-baseless conspiratorial rhetoric \u2014 from questioning the birthplace of President Barack Obama to claiming widespread election fraud \u2014 has lent an air of legitimacy to Jones and others, linking them together and often emboldening them.",
      "\u201cYour entire future hangs in the balance with Trump being successful and us being successful,\u201d Jones said Thursday.",
      "Jones\u2019 following reached its height by the mid-2010s, Peck said, as he showcased \u201chis clownish behavior, ripping off his shirt and screaming during broadcasts.\u201d",
      "Peck said Jones can also be credited with creating conflict with political adversaries and using that division to drive views. But while Jones snagged a high-profile interview in 2015 with then-candidate Trump, the subsequent fallout of the Sandy Hook lawsuits has hobbled him financially and hurt his persona.",
      "YouTube and other social media platforms began removing Jones\u2019 videos in 2018 as they were flagged for violating content rules related to violent and graphic content. He was suspended from Facebook and Twitter, significantly reducing the reach of Infowars.",
      "\u201cThe mark of whether he has influence may be if the politically powerful see him as useful or not,\u201d Peck said, \u201cand by politicians not going on his show, I guess that suggests his influence is waning or nonexistent.\u201d",
      "But Josh Owens, who worked for Infowars from 2013 to 2017, said Jones\u2019 legacy lives on in how conspiracy-minded outlets have made big business of undermining any sense of \u201cobjective truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter what\u2019s real or what\u2019s not real. People are going to believe what they want,\u201d Owens said. \u201cAnd I think Alex Jones has played a huge role in that.\u201d",
      "For further evidence of that legacy, said Owens, a former Infowars video editor, look no further than the current U.S. political landscape.",
      "Jones \u201chas been far more wrong than he\u2019s right, but he\u2019s constructed this narrative and this world where it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see Trump doing the same thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust a complete erosion of trust and truth,\u201d he added.",
      "Beyond Infowars, a sizable and thriving world of pro-Trump media that often traffics in conspiracy theories continues with few limitations, especially as major social networks have rolled back some of their moderation policies that once sought to limit the spread of false claims and extreme rhetoric. And some on the right have even succeeded in building or buying their own platforms \u2014 most notably Elon Musk in his purchase of Twitter and in the rise of the video platform Rumble.",
      "Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of digital platforms and ethics at the University of Oregon, said the loss of Jones\u2019 original Infowars appears to be one way to hold him accountable.",
      "However, she said, there are other influencers, who, like Jones, will find their spaces in a changing media ecosystem in which audiences are shifting away from traditional news sources and turning to social media and podcast personalities for information.",
      "\u201cWhat is going to happen with Infowars \u2018Onion-ified,\u2019 and what is going to happen to the kinds of internet conspiracy theorists who Alex Jones represents?\u201d Phillips asked. \u201cThere is going to be a fertile ground for them as ever before.\u201d",

      "One of several airstrikes on Friday morning, the attack struck near the Tayouneh junction in an area where the suburbs meet other parts of the city, a more central target than most that Israel has hit. The Israeli military issued a warning on social media identifying buildings there and telling residents to evacuate, saying they were near Hezbollah facilities.",
      "Cease-fire proposal moves forward",

Israel says it\u2019s looking for language in the deal that would allow it to resume attacking if Lebanese and U.N. authorities do not take action in the event Hezbollah violates the agreement. Such language is likely to be a non-starter for Hezbollah.",

      "After 2006, Israel complained Hezbollah fighters and weapons remained in the border are while Lebanon accused Israel of violating the resolution by sending warplanes into its airspace.",
      "The United Nations would bolster its peacekeeping mission in Lebanon to support the Lebanese army during a truce but would not directly enforce a ceasefire, U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Thursday.",
      "Khalil said Lebanon had no objection to U.S. or French participation in overseeing ceasefire compliance.",

      "In September, far-right activist Laura Loomer posted on social media that if Harris were to win, \u201cthe White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.\u201d The post drew condemnation from others on the right, including now-Vice President-elect JD Vance and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. But experts said posts like these tend to have a trickle-down effect.",
      "\u201cWhen those kinds of comments are made, it normalizes that kind of talk,\u201d Dhingra said.",
      "It\u2019s one of the many reasons some experts believe Harris chose not to put much emphasis on her racial identity during her campaign. Though Harris broke glass ceilings throughout her career \u2014 namely as the first Black and South Asian vice president and major-party ticket leader \u2014 she didn\u2019t talk much about her background in 2024.",
      "\u201cKamala Harris\u2019 campaign became very cautious about using her Indian identity,\u201d said Sangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University in New Jersey and the author of \u201cDesis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans.\u201d \u201cOn the right and on the left, I see Indian identity becoming more attacked, contested. That\u2019s a big threat that I see emerging out of this election.\u201d",
      "When asked in an NBC News interview in October about why she didn\u2019t speak much about representation or the historic nature of her run, Harris said she\u2019d rather focus on the issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I\u2019m clearly a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point that most people really care about is can you do the job and do you have a plan to actually focus on them.\u201d",
      "Dhingra says regardless of how much or how little a politician emphasizes their race, others will do it for them.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if the politician is making their group background a salient part of their identity or not,\u201d he said.",
      "At a conference for Black journalists in September, Trump falsely stated that Harris \u201cturned Black\u201d for political gain.",
      "\u201cIs she Indian or is she Black?\u201d he asked.",
      "Racism also followed the Indian American figures rising on the right. When JD Vance was announced as Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick, his wife, Usha Vance. became the target of attacks from white supremacists.",
      "\u201cDo we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and names their kid Vivek is going to support white identity?\u201d far-right commentator Nick Fuentes said.",
      "Ramaswamy, a former GOP presidential candidate, has solidly aligned himself with Trump. On immigration, he even pushed to Trump\u2019s right on certain issues like promising to revoke birthright citizenship and \u201cgut\u201d the skills-based H-1B visa program.",
      "Still, his Indian American identity has drawn fire. When he hosted right-wing commentator Ann Coulter on his podcast in May, she put it plainly: \u201cI agreed with many, many things you said \u2026 but I still would not have voted for you because you\u2019re an Indian,\u201d she told him.",
      "Ramaswamy, alongside Elon Musk, has been tapped by Trump to lead a proposed future department of government efficiency, and Usha Vance will become the first Indian American second lady. But experts say that just because there are brown faces in the administration, that doesn\u2019t mean its heavily anti-immigrant messaging won\u2019t fall on ordinary South Asians.",
      "\u201cThat does not just impact would-be immigrants. That makes all immigrants become, to some degree, less seen as fully American,\u201d Dhingra said.",
      "Communities are scared",
      "Anti-South Asian hate is not new, Dhingra said, but it is something that has spanned the community\u2019s entire history in the U.S. It\u2019s also always reared its head within larger waves of fearmongering around immigrants.",
      "\u201cAt this moment in the country, there\u2019s a lot of political violence going on,\u201d he said. \u201cHate crimes against South Asians have never really gone away.\u201d",
      "Sona, who was verbally attacked while walking in Georgia, says this is the worst she\u2019s seen the climate toward South Asians since the post-9/11 period, when some Indian Americans were presumed to be Muslim and violently attacked, even killed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to many South Asians friends right now who live in certain neighborhoods \u2026 where they are nervous about people knowing that they\u2019re Indian or celebrating Diwali,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a fear of showing that part of your identity, because what could come for you then.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles resident Payal Sawhney, 46, an Indian American immigrant, says her community members often won\u2019t speak up about things that happen to them for fear that their stories won\u2019t be taken seriously.",
      "In her workplace, she\u2019s had a colleague ask her, \u201cWhen are you going back?\u201d She\u2019s seen South Asian homes targeted with burglary, elders called names or attacked on the street, and kids increasingly bullied at school.",
      "\u201cSouth Asians, we don\u2019t voice, we don\u2019t make noise, we just silently are suffering,\u201d she said.",
      "Even though many of her community members sacrificed everything to be in the U.S., some of them are starting to question their place here, Sawhney said.",
      "\u201cThere is no way they want to go back. They announced to the world back home that they are coming here to live their American Dream,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they are in a fix: How do I tell my people back home that there is no such thing as American Dream.\u201d"

      "A federal judge handed that sentence down to 39-year-old Stephanie Pratt for wire fraud on Thursday after she stole nearly $500,000 from her employer in 2021. Prosecutors say she spent that cash on things like tickets for Brady\u2019s return to Gillette Stadium, a hot tub, plane tickets and more than $50,000 worth of items from Amazon.",
      "Pratt was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years of supervised release. She had pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud back in August.",
      "\u201cThe defendant used her position of trust as an employee to steal nearly a half-million dollars from a small New Hampshire business,\u201d U.S. Attorney Jane Young said in a statement. \u201cAmong other items, she used the stolen money to purchase a hot tub and she spent over $5,600 on lavish tickets to watch Tom Brady\u2019s return to Gillette Stadium.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s criminal conduct was bold, as she began her fraud only six months after serving a sentence for stealing from a previous employer.\u201d",
      "Jodi Cohen, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston Division, called Pratt \u201ca greedy, serial fraudster,\u201d in a statement.",
      "Pratt worked as the office administrator and had full access to the company\u2019s finances, including bank accounts and credit cards. Over 6 1/2 years, she stole $492,325 from the company. Prosecutors said she started stealing shortly after she was released from jail for stealing almost $10,000 from her previous employer.",
      "She cashed unauthorized checks to herself and entered them as payments to legitimate vendors in the company\u2019s account system, according to prosecutors. She also used the company\u2019s credit cards to make over 1,000 unauthorized personal purchases, including the Patriots tickets and the hot tub. She also used the stolen money on things like plane tickets and miscellaneous herbs and spices.",
      "When she was confronted about the thefts, prosecutors said Pratt repeatedly lied to the company, even claiming that the owner had her cash the checks to funnel the money to the owner\u2019s son. Pratt didn\u2019t know it, but the owner\u2019s son had already died.",
      "Pratt also doctored the company\u2019s financial records, prosecutors said, editing their credit card statements to delete unauthorized purchases. When asked why there were missing entries in the statements, she said she had adjusted them to make them easier to read. She also claimed that her misuse of the company credit card was due to her clicking the wrong button at checkout, even though it happened over 1,000 times.",
      "And when she was fired for stealing from the company, prosecutors said Pratt demanded that the owner\u2019s widow pay her a Christmas bonus."

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette.\u201d",
      "It was a love story for the (golden) ages! In the emotional finale of \"The Golden Bachelorette,\" Joan Vassos chose her winner on the island of Bora Bora.",
      "Her decision came down to Chock Chapple, a 60-year-old insurance executive from Wichita, Kansas, and Guy Gansert, a 66-year-old ER doctor from Reno, Nevada. Ultimately, she chose Chock \u2014 the man who said, over and over, he was \"crazy about her.\"",
      "Joan, who lost her husband John to pancreatic cancer in 2021, was previously a contestant on \u201cThe Golden Bachelor.\u201d She departed the season voluntarily to care for her daughter, who had recently given birth.",
      "\"I feel happy about my future now that it looks a lot brighter. Chock is the reason for all of this,\" Joan said in a confessional interview.",
      "What happened in the 'Golden Bachelorette' finale?",
      "Chock emerged as a frontrunner early on, but his connection with Joan was cemented after meeting her adult children.",
      "The meeting was emotional \u2014 Joan's son Nick seemed to initially balk when Chock kissed Joan on the lips as a way of a greeting.",
      "But her kids came around. Chock promised that he was not here to \"replace\" their late father in any \"way shape or form.\"",
      "Joan and her kids also marked the difficulty of her moving on romantically. \u201cIf I loved Dad so much, would I be able to fall in love again?\u201d Joan questioned. Nick cheered her on, saying he and his sister were \"proud\" to see her \"take risks,\" and proud of the \"incredible strength\" she demonstrates.",
      "Chock, on his end, said he had a \"great time,\" calling her family \"good people.\"",
      "After the date, Chock declared his love for Joan. While Joan didn't respond, it was enough for her to decide that Chock would be her future husband. She realized was worthy of love \u2014 which came into question following her breakup with contestant Pascal Ibgui.",
      "The episode before the finale, Pascal, a salon owner from Chicago, broke up with Joan in an emotional boat cruise in Tahiti, telling her that he didn\u2019t feel a strong connection.",
      "\"It just makes me feel like I'm unlovable,\" Joan said at the time of the breakup. \"If he couldn't love me, how could anybody love me?\"",
      "And so, before Guy had the opportunity to meet Joan's family, Joan broke up with him. During the \"After the Final Rose\" special, she clarified that she was \"getting there\" with Guy, but they needed more time.",
      "\"It was really, really hard at the end to say goodbye to you because in any other situation, I would have been with you because we would have had more time,\" she said. \"It was absolutely nothing you did. I have missed you. It's been really hard to be away from you.\"",
      "Joan said she hopes she and Guy stay friends and can double date.",
      "Chock proposed on the beach",
      "Heading into the final scenes, Joan and Chock said they felt ready and excited to get engaged.",
      "Joan declared that she wants to \"spend the rest of her life\" with Chock. She had lost hope in her future \u2014 and he helped her bring it back. Chock, meanwhile, said he couldn't believe he found this \"incredible opportunity\" at this point in his life.",
      "In his proposal, Chock said he was \"so absolutely happy\" to be in her life, and have her in his. He acknowledged their late partners and said he would \"honor\" John by \"loving her every day.\"",
      "Joan, similarly, acknowledged the difficulty of having Chock step away from filming because his mother passed away. This, she said, was the moment she knew she couldn't complete the show's journey without him.",
      "\"We are living proof that no matter what life throws at you, there is still hope, even at our age,\" Joan said, proceeding to tell Chock she loved him for the first time.",
      "And with that, Chock got down on one knee and proposed with a Neil Lane ring (naturally). She gave him the final golden rose.",
      "After the proposal, the happy couple FaceTimed with Joan's mom from the beach, who expressed her shock and delight at meeting her daughter's new partner.",
      "\"I never in a million years thought I'd feel love like this again. Ever,\" Joan said.",
      "So, are Joan Vassos and Chock still together?",
      "Host Jesse Palmer revealed Joan and Chock as the franchise\u2019s \u201cnewest \u2018Golden Bachelorette\u2019 couple,\u201d indicating they are still together.",
      "The couple confirmed it in an interview.",
      "\"This feels so good. I'm looking at our family and friends who we've never gotten to be with together, so it's so nice to finally be able to share our love and our story and our future with them,\" Joan said to her loved ones, who were sitting in the audience.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier and I want the world to know it,\u201d Chock said. He then spoke up for his fianc\u00e9e for her behavior on the show. \u201cI want to tell the world, the fans, how classy Joan is and the respect she gave all the other guys,\u201d he added.",
      "Since the engagement, Joan and Chock were able to spend quality time together out of the public eye.",
      "\"We cooked, we played crosswords, I mean we did everything,\" Chock said.",
      "Jesse, in a surprise at the end of the finale, said the show was sending both of their families on a trip to Disney world, earning lots of claps from Joan's grandson."

      "Alex Cross, the literary world\u2019s well-known crime detective, is receiving a makeover in the latest television adaptation, \u201cCross,\u201d coming to Amazon Prime on Nov. 14. The titular star is played stoically by \u201cBlack Adam\u201d breakout Aldis Hodge.",
      "The role of Alex Cross is not new to on-screen adaptations. The first came in 1997\u2019s \u201cKiss the Girls,\u201d with Morgan Freeman playing the hardened Washington D.C. detective. The movie was a loose adaptation of the series\u2019 second book of the same name. A second installment also starring Freeman called \u201cAlong Came a Spider,\u201d released in 2001.",
      "The last major attempt to convert Alex Cross into an on-screen fixture came in 2012 with the aptly named film, \u201cAlex Cross\u201d starring Tyler Perry in the lead role.",
      "With multiple films and a longstanding book series in the rearview, Hodge had the difficult task of making the legendary character his own in an eight episode series. In an interview with TODAY.com, Hodge explained how he approached the task with showrunner Ben Watkins.",
      "\u201cThe perspective of how we shaped this character came in conversations with Ben Watkins where we didn\u2019t even talk about the character. We just talked about what was going on in our personal lives, our lives as men.\u201d",
      "For the 38-year-old actor, one of those \"personal\" life things included his newly appointed role as a father, which he says helped him curate his take on Alex Cross, a proud dad of two.",
      "\u201cI recently stepped into fatherhood,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cI was in a whirlwind of emotions because it\u2019s such a beautiful experience. And those kinds of things really shaped how they went back to write the character as we moved through so I was really stepping into something that was already familiar.\u201d",
      "Hodge is a first-time dad to his now three-year-old daughter. In an October profile of the star by Essence magazine, Hodge expanded on how his new parental role informs his life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what feeds me. It\u2019s what drives me. It\u2019s what wakes me up in the morning. It\u2019s really the thing that makes me say, \u2018Okay, life is worth living.\u2019 It\u2019s what redefines love,\u201d he said.",
      "Hodge says being a dad was one of the ways that helped him authentically portray his character on screen. The other? He says understanding what drove the detective\u2019s everyday life.",
      "\u201cI was stepping into honesty, and all I had to do was keep remembering what Alex Cross\u2019 \u2018why\u2019 was with whatever situation he stepped into,\u201d the actor tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"We didn't have to try for that. All we had to be aware of was making honest decisions and choices,\u201d he says.",
      "The Prime series also stars Isaiah Mustafa as John Sampson, a fellow detective and longtime friend of Alex Cross. The Sampson character has made several appearances in the James Patterson novels but has seldom been brought to the screen.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mustafa opened up about bringing his character's close friendship with Cross to the screen.",
      "\u201cI looked at the relationship that Sampson had with Alex, and I let that inform me as to who Sampson was and how deep his character was, how much love he had for his partner,\u201d Mustafa says. \u201cSo to me, that was the through line. To show how much heart this character had and what he was willing to do to make sure his partner, his brother, lived up to his higher power.\u201d",
      "The backdrop of Washington D.C. also serves as an important component of this new retelling of the Alex Cross story. Hodge explains that in the show, \u201cD.C. stands as its own character.\u201d",
      "The star says that the show attempts to go beyond the political significance of nation\u2019s capital by tapping into the culture of the people that make up the city\u2019s heart.",
      "\u201cSomething that was really important to Ben was that we really bring out the flavor of D.C.\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve only really seen D.C. from the political side, the White House, the monuments,\u201d Hodge explains. \u201cWe owe it to the culture to highlight them in a celebratory way.\u2019"

      "\u201cBut you do kind of feel you wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing as a kid?\u201d Drew Scott asks his twin.",
      "\u201cOne hundred percent I would have done the same thing,\u201d the interior designer quickly responds.",

      "It's no secret how much Jonathan Scott loves being an uncle. After Drew Scott announced Parker's birth in June 2022, his twin shared a sweet tribute to Parker on Instagram.",
      "\"Get ready\u2026 I\u2019m gonna spoil you,\" he penned, in part.",
      "The spoiling seemed to work, as Drew Scott tells TODAY.com that Parker can\u2019t get enough of his uncle when he comes over.",

      "\u201cIf I can help someone who\u2019s watching today get an early screening \u2014 a breast exam, a colonoscopy, a prostate exam \u2014 go do it,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, early detection meant everything.\u201d",
      "Al also shared a similar message following his cancer diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI was going to put off my annual checkup, decided back in September, let me just get this done,\u201d Al said on TODAY in 2021. \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t, (it) would not have detected the prostate cancer, which was very aggressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy outlook and outcome might have been completely different, so I cannot stress enough to people, go out there and get your checkup, make sure you get checked,\u201d he added."

      "The \"Fuller House\" star, who famously played Uncle Joey, noticed his first symptoms a little over a month ago, when he came down with a cold. In the past, he'd noticed the lymph nodes in his neck or armpits would swell when he was sick. This time, though, he felt surprised to discover a golf-ball sized lump in his groin within a week of falling ill.",
      "\u201cIt swelled up immediately,\" Coulier, 65, tells TODAY.com in a phone interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m either really sick, or my body\u2019s really reacting to something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Worried, he visited his doctors who ran a variety of tests, including bloodwork, EKG, and PET and CT scans. While everything appeared to be normal, the doctors biopsied the lymph node just to be safe. Coulier soon learned why his lymph node became so enlarged.",
      "\u201c(My doctors) said, \u2018Hey, we wish we had better news, but you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls. \u201cIt was a shock.\u201d",
      "Despite his cancer diagnosis, Coulier is still finding joy in life.",
      "\u201cMy joke is that in four short weeks I\u2019ve gone from a Virgo to a Cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to retain a sense of reality but also a sense of humor about it.\u201d",
      "Dave Coulier diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "When Coulier felt under the weather a little over a month ago and noticed a swollen lymph node in his groin, he felt puzzled.",
      "\"The onset of this growing lymphoma in my groin area was very quick. So I said, 'Something's not right,'\" he recalled to Hoda during his Nov. 13 appearance on TODAY.",
      "Coulier visited his doctor, who ordered a battery of tests.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Yeah, we need to take a serious look at this.\u2019 And so, we did blood tests,\u201d he says. \u201cBlood tests came back great. My EKG, everything great. Heart, everything perfect.\u201d",
      "But his doctors felt worried by how quickly the lump grew and ordered more advanced imaging before eventually wanting a sample of it for testing.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019d like to either remove this or biopsy it,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls his doctors telling him. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just remove it and biopsy it at the same time?\u2019\u201d",
      "Three days later, Coulier received the news from his doctor that he had B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that develops in B-lymphocytes, according to the American Cancer Society. B-cell lymphomas account for the vast majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Every year, more than 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "\u201cThe first thing I said to them was, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 cancer?\u2019\u201d he Coulier. \u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else.\u201d",
      "Hearing the news was even harder because his wife, Melissa Coulier, wasn\u2019t at home.",
      "\u201cI was just contemplating, \u2018How do I tell her?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I told her, of course, she thought I was joking.\u201d",
      "After he reassured her that he was not joking, Melissa \u201corganized (his) entire life, from nutrition to the doctor\u2019s appointments to the pills.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s got stuff color-coded,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty great.\u201d",
      "To understand what stage of cancer he had, Coulier\u2019s doctors took a bone marrow sample.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to see if (the cancer had) moved on to any major organs or my blood or bones or anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was pins and needles for a few days because I didn\u2019t know what stage it was or if it had progressed.\u201d",
      "Yet at some point, Coulier started feeling a sort of acceptance.",
      "\u201cI told Melissa I don\u2019t know why, but I (am) OK with whatever the news (is) going to be no matter how devastating. \u2026 I can\u2019t explain where that came from,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible life. I\u2019ve had the most amazing people in my life. This has been an extraordinary journey, and I\u2019m OK if this is the end of the journey.\u201d",
      "A few days later, he learned he had Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survival rate",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma means the cancer has not spread outside the lymphatic system, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not spread widely is about 74%, per ACS.",
      "\u201c(Stage 3) doesn\u2019t sound great,\" Coulier says, but because it hasn't spread to his bone marrow, doctors told him his curability rate is upwards of 90%.",
      "\"It's very treatable,\" he said on TODAY.",
      "Starting chemotherapy",
      "Doctors wanted Coulier to start chemotherapy promptly, and he underwent another surgery to have his chemotherapy port, which delivers the medication, placed.",
      "Leading up to his first treatment, Coulier faced his fear of the unknowns of cancer.",
      "\u201cYou hear chemo, and it scares the daylights out of you,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first round was pretty intense because you don\u2019t know what to expect. You don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to feel. Is this going to hit me immediately? Is it going to be devastating? Am I going to walk out of here?\u201d",
      "As \u201ca preemptive strike,\u201d Coulier shaved his head, which he jokes makes him \u201clook like a baby bird.\u201d The last time he was bald was when he shaved his head during the \u201cFull House\u201d series wrap, getting rid of the mullet he sported for many years.",
      "Coulier felt better than expected after his first round of chemotherapy. In total, he\u2019ll have six rounds every 21 days and should be finished with treatment by February 2025. Following treatment, he expects a \u201ctotal remission.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a roller coaster. There (are) days where I feel unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there\u2019s other days where \u2026 I\u2019m just going to lay down and let this be what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",

      "When Coulier feels good, he takes advantage of it. He\u2019s been recording episodes of the podcast \u201cFull House Rewind\u201d with his new co-host Marla Sokoloff, who played Gia Mahan on \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cFuller House.\u201d And he recently skated with the Detroit Red Wings alumni \u2014 though he can\u2019t play hockey as it could damage his chemotherapy port. At the end of this week, John Stamos will visit him following his second round of chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many laughs. We\u2019re going to have so much fun,\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI said, \u2018It could be \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 if I\u2019m just out of it.\u2019 And (Stamos) said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll carry you around.\u2019\u201d",

      "Since his diagnosis, Coulier has learned that \u201che\u2019s strong enough to know (his) weaknesses,\u201d and he understands when to ask for help.",
      "Raising awareness",
      "Sadly, Coulier has plenty of experience with cancer.",
      "\u201cI lost my sister Sharon at 36 years old, breast cancer. I lost my niece Shannon at 29 years old, breast cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mom, and now my sister Karen has cancer. So, over the years I\u2019ve seen what the women in my family have gone through, and it\u2019s been not only an awakening but a learning process.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s been tough watching cancer affect his family so dramatically, the actor has grown from it.",
      "\u201cWhen I was diagnosed, all of those memories came back of what they went through and so many hospital visits and sitting bedside and talking and having conversations and watching them leave the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they went through is 10 times harder than what I\u2019m going through. So, if I can be one-tenth as strong as they were, I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d",
      "His family also taught him to embrace joy, and that has helped him maintain a positive outlook.",
      "\u201cMy mom, my sister and my niece were laughing until the day they died,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a real inspiration for me to just remember that there\u2019s a lot of happiness.\u201d",
      "Coulier\u2019s looking forward to the future. His son, Luc, and his wife, Alex, are expecting a baby boy in March, and Coulier\u2019s excited to become a grandfather and anticipates lots of flights from Michigan to Los Angeles to spend time with his family.",
      "Coulier felt compelled to share his story to raise awareness of cancer and encourage others to undergo screening for it.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that just kept presenting itself to me was to tell other people about it. Talk to them about getting something as simple as pre-screening or a breast exam, mammogram, a colonoscopy or a prostate exam,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really simple thing to do and it can add years to your life.\u201d"

      "Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to need more than four faces, probably. (Jimi) Hendrix, No. 1 for sure. No. 2 is always hotly contested: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Angus Young. I could go on and on. It\u2019s too many, way too many.",

      "What\u2019s your most fun song to perform onstage?",
      "All of them, because I feel really grateful that I don\u2019t have to do a song that I don\u2019t like.

But I love them just as much as I did when I recorded them.",

I\u2019m just as excited to write the next song, put on the next tour, make another album \u2014 like, literally giddy with excitement to do that. That\u2019s never changed.

I\u2019ve just been really blessed and lucky, and the harder I\u2019ve worked, the luckier I\u2019ve become.",

      "Pressing its offensive against the Iran-backed militant group, Israel has this week stepped up airstrikes against the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs \u2014 an escalation that has coincided with indications of movement in U.S.-led diplomatic contacts toward ending the conflict.",
      "One of several airstrikes on Friday morning, the attack struck near the Tayouneh junction in an area where the suburbs meet other parts of the city, a more central target than most that Israel has hit. The Israeli military issued a warning on social media identifying buildings there and telling residents to evacuate, saying they were near Hezbollah facilities.",
      "Cease-fire proposal moves forward",
      "In a more hopeful sign, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon submitted a draft truce proposal to halt fighting between Hezbollah and Israel to Lebanon\u2019s parliament speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday, an adviser to the speaker, Ali Hamdan, told NBC News.",

      "But Israel expects that over the weekend Hezbollah will give its response, an Israeli official tells NBC News.",
      "The proposal calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon in return for Hezbollah fighters withdrawing to north of the Litani River, which runs about 20 miles from Lebanon\u2019s southern border. United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanese troops would be tasked with monitoring and enforcing the deal.",
      "The Israeli official said a key sticking point is the question of enforcement. Israel says it\u2019s looking for language in the deal that would allow it to resume attacking if Lebanese and U.N. authorities do not take action in the event Hezbollah violates the agreement. Such language is likely to be a non-starter for Hezbollah.",

      "The U.S. proposal has 13 points that have all been agreed on, an official from Berri's office told NBC News. Now the key is fine-tuning the wording, that official said.",
      "The proposal calls for the full implementation of U.N. Security Council\u00a0Resolution 1701, which ended a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, the official said. It also calls for the series of steps outlined above to be taken in the first 60 days, according to the source.",
      "On the Lebanese side, the source said, the fear is that Israel will pull out at the last moment, as it did at the end of September when Israel backed out and assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "The source said that critical talks would be held over the next 72 hours with an announcement possibly \u2014 and hopefully \u2014 coming next week.",
      "The Biden administration is making a push for peace in the waning time before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.",
      "Months of U.S. efforts to broker a deal between Washington\u2019s ally Israel and Hezbollah have so far failed. Israel launched a stepped-up air and ground campaign in Lebanon in late September after nearly a year of cross-border clashes in parallel with the\u00a0Gaza war.",

    "story": [
      "LIMA, Peru \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a weeklong diplomatic blitz of South America on Thursday by inaugurating a massive deep-water port in Peru, a $1.3 billion investment by Beijing as it seeks to expand trade and influence on the continent.",
      "With China\u2019s demand for agricultural goods and metals from Latin America growing, Xi will participate in the\u00a0Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit\u00a0in\u00a0Lima\u00a0and then head to the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next week, where he will also make a state visit to Brazil.",
      "Xi and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte participated on Thursday by video link in the opening of the Chancay port, about 48 miles north of Lima on the Pacific Ocean, and signed a deal to\u00a0widen an existing free trade agreement.",
      "Xi said that Chancay, a 15-berth, deep-water port, was the successful start of a \u201c21st-century maritime Silk Road\u201d and part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, its modern revival of the ancient Silk Road trading route.",
      "\u201cChina is willing to work with the Peruvian side to take the Chancay project as a starting point to forge a new maritime-land corridor between China and Latin America and connect the Great Inca Trail,\u201d Xi said, referring to a 15th-century mountain network that joined the Inca empire.",
      "In an opinion article in the state newspaper El Peruano, Xi said the Chancay project would generate $4.5 billion in annual revenue, create more than 8,000 direct jobs and reduce the logistics costs of the Peru-China route by 20%.",
      "The China-controlled megaport was built by Cosco Shipping Ports, and received $1.3 billion in Chinese investment for its first phase. China is expected to spend billions more as Beijing and Lima work to position it as a major shipping hub between Asia and South America.",
      "The first ship is due to set sail from Chancay next week, transporting Peruvian fruit to China, said Mario Ocharan, Peruvian director of the Chancay Chamber of Commerce.",
      "China\u2019s main motivation for developing the megaport, according to Ocharan, was access to neighboring Brazil, where a new railway line is planned to carry Brazilian exports such as soybeans and iron ore to the port.",
      "The rail project is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, according to Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager at Cosco Shipping Chancay Peru.",
      "Building that link is \u201ccrucial\u201d to improve transportation of soybeans, as Brazil is the top seller of the commodity to China, he said.",
      "The inauguration of the port comes as Beijing is looking to further tap into resource-rich Latin America, amid\u00a0trade tensions with Europe\u00a0and concerns about future U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports from the incoming\u00a0Trump administration.",

      "Robert Evan Ellis, Latin America research professor at the U.S. Army War College, said that Chancay will make shipping between Latin America and China more efficient.",
      "Because the port can handle the biggest ships, it will reduce the need for shippers to consolidate cargo containers at intermediary points, reducing costs and handling times.",
      "\u201cChancay illustrates how China seeks secure access to resources and markets and its ever more successful fight to corner global value added,\u201d Ellis said.",
      "China\u2019s major investment in Chancay has raised alarm bells in Washington. Gen. Laura Richardson, former chief of the U.S. Southern Command, warned this month that Chancay could be used by the Chinese navy and for intelligence-gathering.",
      "U.S. anxieties about Chancay reflect a\u00a0broader, decades-long shift\u00a0in a region Washington long saw as its backyard. China has overtaken the United States to become the largest trading partner of countries such as Peru.",
      "China\u2019s state-backed Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial on Monday that the port was \u201cby no means a tool for geopolitical competition,\u201d calling U.S. accusations of the port\u2019s potential military use \u201csmears.\u201d"
