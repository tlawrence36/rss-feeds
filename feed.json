      "TORONTO -- For the third time, the knives were out at the Toronto International Film Festival.",
      "Rian Johnson on Saturday night premiered the third movie in his whodunit series, \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d Like the previous two movies, \u201cKnives Out\u201d and \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d Johnson brought a cavalcade of stars to Toronto\u2019s Princess of Wales Theatre for what was easily the hottest ticket of the festival.",
      "\u201cThis is my favorite place to be in the world,\u201d said Johnson, recalling the similar TIFF first weekend premieres of his first two mysteries.",
      "\u201cWake Up, Dead Man\u201d is arguably Johnson's darkest, most intricate and most star-studded \u201cKnives Out\u201d mystery yet. It includes plenty of the quips that have characterized the first two movies (there are \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cScooby Doo\u201d references), but the film is also more ambitiously existential.",
      "Daniel Craig\u2019s Benoit Blanc returns for a murder case involving a local church, with themes of truth, lies and grace threaded throughout. Josh O\u2019Connor stars a young priest named Jud Duplenticy, with Josh Brolin as the Monsignor and Glenn Close as a devout parishioner. The cast also includes Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Daryl McCormack, Andrew Scott, Kerry Washington, Thomas Haden Church and Cailee Spaeny.",
      "\u201cThe first one was kind of a cozy, Agatha Christie family mystery. The second one was a big blow-out vacation mystery. And with this third one, we're going back to the roots of the genre,\" Johnson said. \u201cAnd the roots of genre actually lie in Edgar Allan Poe. A little gothic. We're going to go by way of Poe into some John Dickson Carr. We're going to veer into some G.K. Chesterton with the Father Brown mysteries. And we're going to go back to church.\u201d",

Though much smaller than a traditional theatrical opening (big productions typically launch in 3,000 to 4,000 theaters), the movie was estimated to gross $15 million in its first week.",

      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival has wrapped up, but the buzz continues",
      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival may be over, but the conversations on the films that premiered, the things people said, the clothes they wore, and how it affects the Oscar race are still going.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of the big moments and takeaways from this year\u2019s edition.",
      "Jim Jarmusch\u2019s quiet film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d took the top prize, the Golden Lion. It was a surprise to many who expected that honor to go to \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which ended up with the runner up award, or \u201cNo Other Choice.\u201d",
      "Aside from Benny Safdie\u2019s best director win for \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d Hollywood players were largely shut out of the awards in favor of a diverse, international selection. Chinese actor Xin Zhilei won best actress for Cai Shangjun\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Rises on Us All,\u201d Italian icon Toni Servillo won best actor for \u201cLa Grazia\u201d and Swiss actor Luna Wedler took the up-and-comer prize, the Marcello Mastroianni Award, for \u201cSilent Friend.\u201d",
      "The awards didn\u2019t give many hints, but Venice has been known to launch several best actor campaigns including Joaquin Phoenix in \u201cJoker,\u201dBrendan Fraser in \u201cThe Whale\u201d and Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d This year the most obvious heavyweight to follow is Dwayne Johnson for his turn as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons were also strange and fierce as kidnapped and kidnapper in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s provocative \u201cBugonia.\u201d Oscar Isaac portrayed Victor Frankenstein as a romantic madman and Jacob Elordi was na\u00efve and raw as the monster. Amanda Seyfried put a human, feminist, face to the religious sect the shakers in \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee,\u201d and Julia Roberts flexed her acting muscles as a Yale philosophy professor in the midst of a misconduct accusation against a colleague in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "Filmmakers like Kathryn Bigelow and previous Golden Lion winners Guillermo del Toro and Yorgos Lanthimos will also likely be in the conversation for months to come.",
      "There\u2019s always some unexpected Hollywood person at the Venice Film Festival who doesn\u2019t seem to be associated with any one film. Sometimes they\u2019ve come in for amfAR, sometimes they\u2019ve been invited by one of the festival\u2019s sponsors. But text chains started blowing up when Seth Rogen started popping up everywhere: Red carpets, press conferences, parties. Don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a Venice episode of \u201cThe Studio\u201d in the works: This trip was research, and maybe even a little more.",
      "In a cute, unexpected (possibly highly staged) moment during the festival, Amanda Seyfried commented on Julia Roberts\u2019 Instagram asking to \u201cplease let me wear the same outfit.\u201d Three days later, Seyfried was also rocking the Versace blazer, jeans, button up and belt, just with different shoes. It helps that they share a stylist, Elizabeth Stewart.",
      "First, let\u2019s just make clear that entertainment trade publications only started tracking Venice standing ovations recently. This year, audiences at the premiere of \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d applauded for 22-minutes, surpassing the 18-minute record set last year by \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which went on to win the Golden Lion. Even with a limited data set, that\u2019s a long time to clap after a movie.",
      "Other standing ovation times from the 82nd festival: \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ((tilde)5 minutes), \u201cBugonia\u201d ((tilde)6 minutes), \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d ((tilde)7 minutes), \u201cJay Kelly\u201d ((tilde)9 minutes), \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d ((tilde)10 minutes), \u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d ((tilde)11 minutes), \u201cFrankenstein\u201d ((tilde)14 minutes), \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes), \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes).",
      "The festival might not take political stances, but politics, and filmmakers grappling with the state of the world, from the Israel-Hamas conflict to nuclear weapons, were clearly top of mind. Kathryn Bigelow set off a warning shot about nuclear weapons and the apparatus of decision making with her urgent, and distressingly realistic, thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite.\u201d Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania made an essential document of the human toll in Gaza with \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d And Olivier Assayas charted the rise of Vladimir Putin in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",

      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon. The Palazzo del Cinema, featuring three movie theaters, is the main headquarters of the festival. It takes 32 minutes to make the journey, by vaporetto, the public water bus. (For good measure, pun somewhat intended, 4.5 kilometers is just under 3 miles.)",
      "Over the decades, few tableaux are as glamorous as movies stars arriving, stylishly disheveled, by launch to the festival. Ferried to and from the Lido, celebrities, journalists and members of the public with passes cross the Venetian Lagoon. Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",
      "Every film shown at Venice has to have subtitles burned in: Non-Italian-language movies must have Italian subtitles, and Italian-language movies must have English subtitles. (All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following. But the NFL game in Sao Paulo, which could draw Swift to NeoQuimica Arena, has kept the Swiftie vibe alive among many local supporters.",
      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",
      "The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren\u2019t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,\u201d said Thomas Heldrup, the group\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement.",
      "On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,\u201d Heldrup said.",
      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",

      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",

      "A new generation of songwriters are stepping into the spotlight, gaining recognition alongside the artists they write for",
      "New York -- When songs top the charts, they become inescapable: Cross-genre hits are heard on the radio, on streaming, in lobbies and grocery stores. The artists who perform them become famous. But the people who wrote those earworms? Many do not.",
      "At least, that used to be the case.",
      "In the last few years, a new generation of songwriters has begun stepping into the spotlight. Muni Long has a successful R&B career; songwriter HARDY has done the same in the country music space. Julia Michaels writes big pop hits and records her own. Victoria Mon\u00e9t went from Grammy nominations as a songwriter and producer to taking home trophies as a solo artist. Amy Allen has become a household name following the ubiquity of her work with Sabrina Carpenter. The same could be said about \u00c9dgar Barrera, who has dominated Latin music as both a songwriter and producer.",
      "On Netflix, a new reality show, \u201cHitmakers,\u201d follows a group of songwriters as they ship off to writing camps to work on songs for John Legend, Shaboozey, Usher and Blackpink\u2019s Lisa.",
      "The industry has taken note, too. For the 2023 Grammys, a \u201csongwriter of the year\u201d award was created to spotlight the talents of those who write for others. That year\u2019s award went to Tobias Jesso Jr., for his songs for Harry Stiles, Adele, FKA Twigs and others. Theron Thomas won in 2024 and Allen in 2025.",
      "Here\u2019s how it happened.",
      "Why is there a buzz around songwriters now? The answer is challenging to pinpoint. Allen says she\u2019s noticed a shift in \u201cthe past six years,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI am so grateful that the general public is starting to take interest in the people behind the curtain of how music is made,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I think songwriters have kind of long gone without any type of visibility or recognition.\u201d",
      "She credits fans \u2013 modern music listeners \u2013 for driving attention to her and her colleagues and social media platforms like TikTok for some of this newfound interest. Online, dedicated fans are curious about the names behind their favorite songs, what Allen describes as a desire to \u201cconnect the dots \u2026 like they\u2019re trying to solve a murder mystery.\u201d",
      "PYNK BEARD, an emerging country music artist and a Grammy-award winning R&B songwriter under the moniker Sebastian Kole, agrees, but says that crate-digging behavior is reserved for \u201csuper fans.\u201d Algorithms, too, must be credited here: The exposure to other artists \u2014 including songwriters \u2014 emerges from listening to a playlist or online radio.",
      "Michaels says some of the credit goes to the artists they write for, who are making their collaborators known by name.",
      "\u201cI sometimes think songwriters are sort of the dishwater of the music industry. We get the short end of the stick a lot of the time. And so, it really comes down to artists\u2019 recognition of songwriters,\u201d she says. \u201cFor that to happen is really special. And I see it happen more and more nowadays. It\u2019s really great that songwriters are getting their flowers.\u201d",

      "\u201cSongwriting is always my first love. Like, I\u2019m always going to want to write songs with and for other people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also this very strong desire to be able to have my own voice as well.\u201d",
      "The majority of PYNK BEARD\u2019s songwriting career as Sebastian Kole has been in the R&B space, working with Alessia Cara, Legend, Alicia Keys, Halle Bailey and more. As a solo artist, he makes country music. He says writing for others and writing for himself are two distinct skill sets, each a unique expression of creativity and empathy. \u201cAs a songwriter, my job is to listen and mimic,\u201d he says. \u201cMy job as a songwriter is to get as close to their voice as possible.\u201d",
      "Writing for himself \u201cis completely different \u2026 you have to really get to know yourself again.\u201d",
      "In the first episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cHitmakers,\u201d the writer Trey Campbell introduces himself by saying that even though he is Grammy nominated, he still drives for Uber to support himself. For many writers, that is the reality of the job.",
      "\u201cThe songwriter position is probably the most glorified, underappreciated job in music, right? Everybody thinks, \u2018Oh, the songwriter, the person that wrote the song, they make all this money,\u2019\u201d says PYNK BEARD. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In the music industry, artists, songwriters, and producers earn income from their creative works via music royalties. There are two kinds: publishing (the notes, melodies, chords, rhythms, lyrics, etc.) and master rights (the master recording, typically owned by the record label). Songwriters do not receive master rights, which limits how much they are compensated.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t make any money. You can\u2019t make a living. But if you are the artist, then all of a sudden, you get to participate on the master,\u201d he says. That changes things.",
      "But ultimately, it\u2019s not just a financial reality. Songwriters choosing to record their own music is just another expression of creative autonomy.",
      "\u201cAs an artist, you get to be more in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see a lot more songwriters doing that.\u201d",

      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too.

On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",

It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",

      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies.

To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",

      "\u201cKokuho,\u201d which means \u201cnational treasure,\u201d has already grossed more than 10 billion yen ($68 million), making it the second-highest grossing Japanese live-action film of all time, and the first to achieve that in more than two decades.",
      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",
      "They look stunning, and convincing, having gone through months of training with a real Kabuki actor.",

      "The plot of \u201cKokuho\u201d \u2014 pronounced Koh-koo-hoe \u2014 explores perennial themes of family and the grueling hardships of being an artist, set to the backdrop of the intense but dreamlike life of the Kabuki actor.",
      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",
      "\u201cMany people can relate to the film,\u201d he added.",
      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "Hiroyuki Okada, a teacher in the traditional \u201cikebana\u201d flower arrangement, said the film gave him a sense of satisfaction as though he had seen high quality theater, and that the characters seemed to represent light and darkness, or the Asian duality of \u201cyin and yang.\u201d",

      "Lee was deeply moved to see people watching his film, glued to the screen. The scene was straight out of the movies, he recalled",
      "\u201cThere the barriers of generations were gone, living proof that everyone is searching for the moment that truly touches our emotions, knowing how beautiful those tears that flow for no reason can be,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFilms are so wonderful.

      "Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who in emulation of his father lived for years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who was inspired by his father to spend years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, died Tuesday at age 97.",
      "Hemingway, the second of the author's three sons, died at his home in Bozeman, Montana, his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, confirmed in a statement.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",
      "As an executor of his father's estate, Patrick Hemingway approved reissues of such classics as \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"A Moveable Feast,\" featuring revised texts and additional commentary from the author\u2019s son and others. The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure.

      "International officials say contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia could be the source of radioactive material behind recalls of imported shrimp",
      "Contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia may be the source of radioactive material that led to massive recalls of imported frozen shrimp, international nuclear safety officials say, as efforts are underway to halt more U.S.-bound shipments.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that officials are in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Indonesian nuclear regulators who have detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, at a processing plant that sent millions of pounds of shrimp to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPreliminary information suggests that it may have originated from activities at a metal melting facility at the same industrial site or from the disposal of scrap metal junk to other areas of the site,\u201d IAEA spokesperson Fredrik Dahl said in an email.",
      "No U.S. investigators have been sent to the site in Serang, west of Jakarta, federal officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the company that exported the shrimp, PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, also known as BMS Foods, has recalled more than 300 shipping containers that were already on their way to the U.S., Dahl said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",
      "This week, additional recalls were issued by Tampa Maid Foods LLC, of Florida, for breaded butterfly shrimp sold under Admiral of the Fleet, Portico Seafood Classic and other labels.",
      "None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.",
      "The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a \u201cpotential health concern\u201d for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.",
      "The FDA issued an import alert for shrimp from BMS Foods to stop the products from coming into the U.S.",
      "The company sent about 12 million pounds of shrimp to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia, in July and August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection records obtained by Import Genius, a trade data analysis company.",

      "The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA\u2019s level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.",
      "Still, it is unusual to see that concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, a nuclear medicine expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the contamination could have come from recycling old medical equipment that contained Cesium-137, Biegalski said. The material has been used in medical devices to reduce blood contamination and to treat cancer, for instance.",
      "When such equipment is no longer useful, it can be recycled. But if the Cesium-137 isn\u2019t properly removed, radioactive material can be released into the environment.",

      "The calls from the prominent Democratic family came a day after Kennedy had to defend his recent efforts to pull back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and fire high-level officials at the Centers for Disease Control at a three-hour Senate hearing.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is a threat to the health and wellbeing of every American,\u201d Joseph P. Kennedy III said in a post on X. The former congressman added: \u201cNone of us will be spared the pain he is inflicting.\u201d His aunt echoed those claims, saying \u201cmedical decisions belong in the hands of trained and licensed professionals, not incompetent and misguided leadership.\u201d",

      "The law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.",
      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",
      "Under the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.",
      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",

      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",
      "\u201cOur choice was to go for that last patient out there \u2014 to go for the social impact,\u201d said Cox.",

      "An expanding iron-ore mine and a deposit of rare-earth minerals are fragmenting the land in northern Sweden and altering ancient reindeer migration routes",
      "KIRUNA, Sweden -- High atop the Luossavaara Mountain in northern Sweden, Sami reindeer herder Lars-Marcus Kuhmunen mapped out a bleak future for himself and other Indigenous people whose reindeer have roamed this land for thousands of years.",
      "An expanding iron-ore mine and a deposit of rare-earth minerals are fragmenting the land and altering ancient reindeer migration routes. But with the Arctic warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, herders say they need more geographic flexibility, not less, to ensure the animals' survival.",
      "If a mine is established at the deposit of rare-earth minerals called Per Geijer, which Sweden heralds as Europe\u2019s largest, Kuhmunen said it could completely cut off the migration routes used by the Sami village of Gabna.",
      "That would be the end of the Indigenous way of life for Kuhmunen, his children and their fellow Sami reindeer herders, he said, in this far-north corner of Sweden some 200 kilometers (124 miles) above the Arctic Circle.",
      "\u201cThe reindeer is the fundamental base of the Sami culture in Sweden,\u201d Kuhmunen said. \u201cEverything is founded around the reindeers: The food, the language, the knowledge of mountains. Everything is founded around the reindeer herding. If that ceases to exist, the Sami culture will also cease to exist.\u201d",
      "Sami herders are descended from a once-nomadic people scattered across a region spanning the far north of Sweden, Norway, Finland and the northwestern corner of Russia. Until the 1960s, members of this Indigenous minority were discouraged from reindeer herding, and the church and state suppressed their language and culture.",
      "In Sweden alone there are at least 20,000 people with Sami heritage, though an official count does not exist because an ethnicity-based census is against the law. Today, a Sami village called a sameby is a business entity dictated by the state, which determines how many semi-domesticated reindeer each village can have and where they can roam.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more a problem to have a sort of sustainable reindeer husbandry and to be able to have the reindeers to survive the Arctic winter and into the next year,\u201d said Stefan Mikaelsson, a member of the Sami Parliament.",
      "In the Gabna village, Kuhmunen oversees about 2,500 to 3,000 reindeer and 15 to 20 herders. Their families, some 150 people in total, depend on the bottom line of the business.",
      "Even before the discovery of the Per Geijer deposit, they had to contend with the expanding footprint of Kiirunavaara. The world\u2019s largest underground, iron-ore mine has forced the village's herders to lead their reindeer through a longer and harder migration route.",
      "Swedish officials and LKAB, the state-owned mining company, say the proposed Per Geijer mine could reduce Europe's reliance on China for rare-earth minerals. LKAB hopes to begin mining there in the 2030s.",
      "Besides being essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles, rare-earth minerals also are considered crucial to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.",
      "But if work on Per Geijer goes forward, Kuhmunen said there will be no other routes for the Gabna herders to take the reindeer east from the mountains in the summer to the grazing pastures full of nutrient-rich lichen in the winter.",
      "The village will contest the mine in court but Kuhmunen said he is not optimistic.",
      "\u201cIt's really difficult to fight a mine. They have all the resources, they have all the means. They have the money. We don\u2019t have that,\" Kuhmunen said. \u201cWe only have our will to exist. To pass these grazing lands to our children.\"",
      "Darren Wilson, LKAB\u2019s senior vice president of special products, said the mining company is seeking solutions to assist the Sami herders, though he would not speculate on what they might be.",

      "Climate change is wreaking havoc on traditional Sami reindeer husbandry.",

The freezing rain then traps lichen under a thick layer of ice where hungry reindeer can\u2019t reach the food, according to Anna Skarin, a reindeer husbandry expert and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences professor.",
      "In the summer, mountain temperatures have risen to 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) and left reindeer over-heated and unable to graze enough to gain the weight needed to sustain them in winter.",
      "Some in Sweden suggest putting the reindeer onto trucks to ferry them between grazing lands if the Per Geijer mine is built. But Skarin said that isn't feasible because the animals eat on the move and the relocation would deny them food to be grazed while walking from one area to another.",
      "\u201cSo you\u2019re kind of both taking away the migration route that they have used traditionally over hundreds and thousands of years,\" she said, \"and you would also take away that forage resource that they should have used during that time.\u201d",

Of its rivals on the right, the Conservatives want it reduced and the Progress Party, which calls for lower taxes and more immigration controls, wants it scrapped. Previously a fringe issue, it has been at the heart of this campaign.",
      "Around 4.3 million people in the nation of some 5.6 million are eligible to vote for the new 169-member parliament, or Storting. Official results are expected on Tuesday. They are usually followed by weeks of horse-trading to form a coalition and agree on cabinet positions.",
      "The result isn\u2019t likely to have major implications for Norway\u2019s foreign policy. The country is a stalwart member of NATO and a strong supporter of Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia.",
      "The wealth tax is a levy of up to 1.1% on assets and shares worth more than 1.76 million kroner (around $176,000), though there are various reductions and discounts, for instance taking account of debt and property. Labor says that scrapping it would cost 34 billion kroner ($3.3 billion) per year.",
      "The Progress Party, which leads the right-wing coalition, is calling for the wealth tax to be abolished, arguing that it is detrimental to the economy.

      "\u201cThe money paid in wealth tax could have been spent creating businesses, new jobs and more innovation,\u201d Listhaug wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Polls show Listhaug's party ahead of the Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who were the senior partner in the last center-right government from 2013 to 2021.

Gross domestic product per person is the sixth-highest in the world, one place above the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.",
      "It is also one of the world's most egalitarian countries, sharing its wealth much more evenly than many others \u2014 and the way Norway\u2019s riches have been used for international aid and investment has also emerged as a campaign issue.",

      "Leo canonized Carlo Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. During the first saint-making Mass of his pontificate, Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \u201cmasterpieces\u201d out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\u201cThe greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God\u2019s plan,\u201d Leo said in his homily. The new saints \u201care an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\u201d",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "Acutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. He earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer,\u201d thanks to his main tech legacy: a multilingual website documenting so-called Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church, a project he completed at a time when the development of such sites was the domain of professionals.",
      "He was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day. The Catholic hierarchy has been trying to promote the practice of Eucharistic adoration because, according to polls, most Catholics don\u2019t believe Christ is physically present in the Eucharistic hosts.",
      "But Acutis limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones. That discipline and restraint has proved appealing to the Catholic hierarchy, which has sounded the alarm about the dangers of today's tech-driven society.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, Acutis fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",
      "In the years since his death, young Catholics have flocked by the millions to Assisi, where they can see the young Acutis through a glass-sided tomb, dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt. He seems as if he's sleeping, and questions have swirled about how his body was so well preserved, especially since parts of his heart have even toured the world as relics.",
      "Both saint-making ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but were postponed following Pope Francis\u2019 death in April. Francis had fervently pushed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to the faith while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",

      "Kowalsky said he was particularly excited that his own namesake \u2014 Pope Leo \u2014 would be canonizing the patron of his school. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of all mashed up into one thing, so it is a joy to be a part of,\u201d Kowalsky said in an interview last week.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Polls closed Sunday in Argentina's unusually high-stakes local election for lawmakers in the country\u2019s most populous province of Buenos Aires, voting that is seen as a referendum on the performance of libertarian President Javier Milei and a bellwether for crucial midterms next month.",
      "The Buenos Aires provincial election is polarized between Milei\u2019s recently formed libertarian party and Peronism, the ideologically flexible populist movement that has held sway in Argentina for decades.",
      "Milei, whose barely 4-year-old La Libertad Avanza party has subsumed much of the center-right, views this a chance to embarrass the Peronist opposition led by former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in its historic stronghold.",
      "\u201cThese elections will be useful to understand the level of support that the government has but also how strong the Peronist party is, especially ahead of October midterms where the government needs a good result to push its reforms,\u201d said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, the head of Cefeidas Group, a consultancy in Buenos Aires.",
      "But the test comes at a tough time.",
      "A bribery scandal has rocked the nation, entangling Milei\u2019s politically powerful sister and undercutting the president\u2019s image as a political outsider pitted against the corrupt Peronist elite. Milei denies the allegations that his sister took kickbacks from pharmaceutical contracts.",
      "The opposition-dominated Congress has started to turn against Milei\u2019s harsh cuts to social programs, overriding his veto on raising disability benefits and approving bills that boost scant funding for healthcare and universities.",
      "Adding to the pressure, Argentina\u2019s economy is shrinking, consumer confidence is falling, unemployment is rising and interest rates are soaring to record highs as the government repeatedly intervenes in the currency market to prop up the peso and hold down inflation in hopes of placating cash-strapped voters.",
      "As a result, Milei hasn\u2019t built up enough foreign currency reserves to assure global markets that he can make good on his promise to transform this nine-time serial defaulter into a normal country capable of servicing its debts.",
      "\u201cMilei has a very strong ideology, and his vision is that the state has to have a minimal impact and investments have to come from the private sector. But that hasn\u2019t materialized yet,\u201d said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine political analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO.",
      "Sunday\u2019s vote to elect 69 provincial lawmakers and councilors in dozens of municipalities will not change national policy, nor will it affect the national Congress that holds its midterm elections to renew half of the lower house and a third of the Senate in late October.",

      "Despite the headwinds, Milei has a few assets in his favor: He has fulfilled his flagship campaign pledge to bring down Argentina\u2019s sky-high inflation rate. And his rivals \u2014 whose reckless spending helped deliver the crisis that he inherited \u2014 are in disarray.",
      "Former President Fern\u00e1ndez, who pulled Peronism to the left during her 2007-2015 tenure and remains its most powerful leader, has been banned from politics for life and placed under house arrest over a corruption conviction.",
      "The party\u2019s future leadership remains uncertain. The movement has struggled to articulate a clear political vision beyond opposition to Milei or economic policy beyond the same patchwork of price controls and cash handouts.",
      "Nonetheless, a sputtering economy and ballooning government corruption scandal has given a jolt of optimism to Peronists in the province where Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, the charismatic army general and grandmaster of 20th century Argentine politics, first built his working-class base in the 1940s.",
      "\u201cRight now, people don\u2019t have a lot of options in front of them,\u201d said Iparraguirre. \u201cThey may be disillusioned with Milei. But they don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d",

      "Luz Elena Galeano and 40 other women have been searching for their loved ones in a landfill in Medellin, Colombia",
      "MEDELLIN, Colombia -- Luz Elena Galeano intently watches as the earth is sifted for clothing, documents and bone fragments, hoping for a sign of her husband, who disappeared two decades ago during the urban conflict that tore apart the Colombian city of Medellin.",
      "It has been a daily ritual for Galeano and 40 other women who take turns monitoring the soil excavated from La Escombrera, a debris landfill on Medellin\u2019s outskirts, where the remains of six people were found in the last eight months.",
      "The effort is part of an ambitious forensic project by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, a tribunal established in 2018 to investigate and prosecute crimes that happened during Colombia's armed conflict, often by rebel groups who kept hostages for ransom.",
      "The Associated Press was granted access to La Escombrera, where excavations that began in July 2024 have confirmed the site is a mass grave, as families had claimed for decades.",
      "\u201cYou could still see the ropes they were tied with and how they were all in a fetal position,\u201d said Galeano, 61, who has been searching for her husband since he vanished in 2008.",
      "No one knows how many more bodies could be there, but nearly 500 people have been reported missing in that part of the city since the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe discovery of human remains was very important in letting the country know that we are not crazy, that we are not liars,\u201d said Galeano, a spokesperson for Women Walking for Truth, an organization for victims of forced disappearances in Medellin founded in 2022.",
      "These families have come to symbolize the search for the more than 120,000 people who disappeared in Colombia between 1985 and 2016.",
      "Galeano is searching for her husband, Luis Javier Laverde Salazar, whom she last saw on Dec. 9, 2008. Their last contact was a phone call in which he told her he would be home for dinner. She believes he is buried in La Escombrera and was disappeared by paramilitaries.",
      "La Escombrera sits on a steep hillside in the Comuna 13 district, a once strategic location for moving drugs and weapons. At the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, it was fought over by guerrillas and paramilitaries \u2014 groups that emerged to combat the leftist insurgents\u2014 with the latter eventually gaining control in the early 2000s.",
      "Between 2001 and 2004, Colombian security forces carried out 34 military operations in Comuna 13 in an attempt to take control. Some of these operations have come under scrutiny due to alleged human rights violations against the civilian population, which have been denounced by victims and are now being investigated by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.",
      "\u201cLa Escombrera was a paramilitary base since at least mid-2002,\u201d said Justice Gustavo Salazar, who is leading the investigation with the special tribunal. \"People detained by these groups were taken there to be interrogated, tortured, or simply killed and buried, under the belief that their bodies would never be found.\u201d",
      "According to Salazar, the peak period of disappearances in 2002 aligns with the paramilitaries\u2019 dominance in the area. At the same time, construction waste was being dumped at La Escombrera, a site once used to extract sand before being filled with rubble. While he believes the paramilitaries are the likely perpetrators, he doesn't rule out the possibility that other illegal groups also concealed bodies there.",
      "Former paramilitaries, who have taken part in the peace process since 2003, have admitted to killing and burying people in La Escombrera. They were later convicted.",

      "Salazar said the tribunal is investigating the alleged involvement of security force members with paramilitary groups, but no charges have been filed to date in the Escombrera case.",
      "Margarita Restrepo, 62, lives in fear that her 17-year-old daughter, Carol, is buried in La Escombrera, a site she can see from her home every day. The thought that her daughter could be buried so close to her after 23 years of searching is agonizing.",
      "Carol disappeared on Oct. 25, 2002, during Operacion Orion, a military operation in Comuna 13 carried out by police, soldiers and aerial support at the start of the administration of then- President \u00c1lvaro Uribe.",
      "The discovery of human remains in La Escombrera ignited a debate in Colombia. The conservative party Centro Democr\u00e1tico defended Uribe\u2019s security policy and Operation Orion, arguing the disappearances didn\u2019t happen then and accusing the peace tribunal of political opportunism. In contrast, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first left-wing leader, saw it as confirmation of the state and paramilitary violence he has long condemned.",
      "Restrepo's fear was reignited in July when two bodies were discovered in La Escombrera. One, she was told, belonged to a young woman between 16 and 18 years old who had \u201cperfect teeth,\u201d a detail that matches her memory of her daughter. Now, she waits for the forensic and DNA results.",
      "Authorities have found graves as shallow as 50 centimeters, but with highly preserved skeletal structures. That has allowed them to be identified and returned to their families.",
      "In the future, when the excavations at La Escombrera are finished, the searching families want a memorial to be built in honor of all the disappeared.",
      "\u201cWe want all this pain to be captured there ... and for the story to be told truthfully and respectfully to the country,\u201d said Restrepo.",

      "\u201cSince 2001, we\u2019ve been reporting that there may be more than 350 bodies, but we haven\u2019t been heard,\" said Galeano as she looked down from the top of the landfill to a neighboring mountain where she believes there are mass graves that have never been excavated.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- A 15-year-old computer whiz, Carlo Acutis, was declared the first millennial saint Sunday. Acutis, who died in 2006 after an acute case of leukemia, has been dubbed \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d because of his savvy use of information technology to spread the Catholic faith. It was Pope Leo XIV\u2019s first canonization ceremony.",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy, but not particularly observant Catholic family. His Italian parents, Antonia Salzano and Andrea Acutis, had moved to London from Italy in 1988 when his father was appointed corporate finance executive at financal firm Lazard Brothers & Co. Ltd.",
      "The family moved back to Milan soon after young Carlo was born. Carlo's mother said her son had a normal, happy childhood, albeit one that increasingly showed his religious fervor, thanks particularly to the influence of his Polish Catholic nanny.",
      "\u201cHe had an ordinary life, like all of us. But an ordinary life that became extraordinary,\u201d Salzano says.",

      "He insisted on receiving First Communion, one of the main sacraments of the Catholic Church, at the young age of seven. He would pray before and after Mass before the Eucharist, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "While he enjoyed regular pastimes for his age \u2014 hiking, video games, soccer and joking around with friends \u2013 Acutis also taught catechism in a local parish and did outreach to the homeless.",
      "His father has said Carlo was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. One of his main tech legacies is a computer website documenting more than 100 so-called Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church, a project he completed at a time when such sites were the domain of professionals.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, Acutis fell ill with what his parents thought at first was just a case of the flu. He was hospitalized and quickly diagnosed with acute and aggressive leukemia. Within days, he was dead.",
      "His funeral was held in Milan, but he was eventually entombed in Assisi, where the family vacationed. The hilltop town was already a major pilgrimage destination because of its ties to St. Francis of Assisi. Acutis' presence has drawn millions.",

      "Up until the pontificate of St. John Paul II, sainthood candidates regularly had to wait decades if not centuries to be canonized, well after a \u201ccult of sanctity\u201d had grown around them. This groundswell of devotion from ordinary faithful signaled to the church that there was popular conviction of someone\u2019s holiness, which would then trigger an official church investigation into the person\u2019s life, the first step in the sainthood process.",

      "In July, Ishiba \u2019s ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government. The loss added to an earlier election defeat in the lower house, where the party-led coalition also had lost a majority.",

      "Former Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told an NHK talk show earlier Sunday that the best way to stop the party divide and move forward is for Ishiba \u201cto settle\u201d the dispute before Monday\u2019s vote, urging his resignation. The party has already been distracted from necessary work on economic measures and on figuring out ways to gain opposition support in the next parliamentary session, Tamura said.",

      "The war in the Gaza Strip is starting to look different these days on the Israeli news",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The war in the Gaza Strip is starting to look different these days on the Israeli news.",
      "For most of the past two years, television stations in Israel have paid little attention to suffering in Gaza, giving viewers a steady stream of stories about Israeli heroism, the agony of hostages\u2019 families and the deaths of soldiers in combat.",
      "But that is changing. In recent months, some Israeli stations have begun to share graphic images of malnourished children and a few deeply reported stories about the difficulties of daily life for Palestinians.",
      "This subtle shift comes as Israel faces unprecedented global outrage over the ongoing war, and it reflects deep divisions over whether the military offensive should be halted, though the growing protests and the media coverage have had little effect on Israel\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just truly caring about the situation in Gaza, but also from an Israeli perspective, are we acting correctly in a way that serves the aims of this war?\u201d said Eran Amsalem, a communications professor at Israel\u2019s Hebrew University.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has largely ignored a mass movement calling for an end to the war that is focused on returning the hostages. After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas and two years of regional fighting, appeals on behalf of Palestinians have even less traction.",
      "The first images from the war were of Hamas-led militants storming the border and marauding through Israeli army bases and farming communities. Footage out of Gaza showed people celebrating as hostages were paraded through the streets, bloodied and beaten.",
      "Around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage. Forty-eight remain in Gaza, around 20 of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "It was the worst attack ever carried out on Israel\u2019s homefront and still dominates local newscasts. In the early months, Israelis rallied around the flag after what some referred to as their 9/11, while international media quickly shifted focus to the invasion of Gaza.",
      "\u201cDuring most of the war, the Israeli media really reported very little on the suffering in Gaza or the hunger or destruction,\u201d said Raviv Drucker, a prominent Israeli news anchor. \u201cIf they did report it, it\u2019s only from the Israeli perspective,\" he explained, in terms of how effective it was in destroying Hamas.",
      "Israel has barred international journalists from Gaza since the start of the war, outside of visits organized by the military. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists says it\u2019s the deadliest conflict for reporters the group has ever documented, with at least 189 Palestinian journalists killed by Israeli fire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a strange war, because it\u2019s the 21st century, and everyone has a phone to broadcast,\u201d Drucker said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no one on the ground, so you can\u2019t say, \u2018There\u2019s someone on the ground that I trust.\u2019\u201d",

      "Commentators from right-wing outlets, including Channel 14, regularly cheer the killing of Palestinians and the demolition of their homes, saying there are no innocent civilians in Gaza and that the military should act with even greater force.",
      "The offensive has killed over 64,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. Its figures are seen as reliable by U.N. agencies and many independent experts. Israel disputes the figures but has not provided its own.",
      "Zvi Yehezkeli, an Arab affairs correspondent for Israel\u2019s i24 TV, welcomed the killing of five journalists in an Israeli strike on a hospital last week, accusing them \u2014 without evidence \u2014 of working with Hamas to disseminate fake news harmful to Israel. \u201cBetter late than never,\u201d he said.",
      "The Israeli military has said none of the journalists, including Mariam Dagga, who worked for the AP and other publications, were suspected militants, and it denies targeting them.",
      "Still, the coverage has slightly shifted in recent weeks, with some longer stories about Palestinians appearing in major outlets.",
      "Israeli journalists have given more airtime to the starvation crisis fueled in part by Israel\u2019s 2 1/2 month ban on all humanitarian aid \u2014 including food and medicine \u2014 earlier this year.",

      "Nir Hasson and his colleagues at Israel\u2019s left-leaning Haaretz newspaper have reported extensively on the Palestinians both before and during the war, in articles that are frequently critical of Israel\u2019s conduct. But it\u2019s an outlier in the current media landscape.",
      "\u201cAfter Oct. 7, there\u2019s no doubt that something was broken, and it became completely illegitimate to deal with the pain of the other side,\u201d Hasson said.",
      "\u201cBut I think the Israeli public is more mature than the media gives them credit for,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the public has an ability to listen. I think the media is censoring itself too much.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Anutin Charnvirakul, a veteran politician best known for successfully lobbying to decriminalize cannabis in Thailand, became the country's prime minister after receiving a royal endorsement Sunday, two days after he was chosen by Parliament following a court order that removed his predecessor.",
      "Anutin, 58, succeeds Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the Pheu Thai Party, dismissed last week after being found guilty of ethics violations over a politically compromising phone call with neighboring Cambodia\u2019s Senate President Hun Sen before a border dispute between the two nations turned into a deadly five-day armed conflict in July that raised fears of a full-blown war in the region.",
      "Thailand\u2019s new prime minister had served in Paetongtarn\u2019s Cabinet as a deputy prime minister and an interior minister, but resigned his positions and withdrew his party from her coalition government after news of the leaked phone call caused public uproar.",
      "Anutin received the letter of appointment in a ceremony at his party Bhumjaithai\u2019s headquarters in Bangkok, attended by senior members of parties expected to join his coalition government. They wore white civil servants\u2019 uniforms used for royal and state ceremonies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to take an oath that I determine to perform my duties to my fullest capabilities, with honesty and virtue,\u201d he read out a statement after receiving the endorsement.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Anutin said his government will seek to address the country\u2019s urgent problems, including the economy, the border conflict with Cambodia, natural disasters and crimes.",
      "He also reiterated he will commit to a promise to rewrite the constitution and call an early election \u201cto return power to the people to decide on the future of the country.\u201d",
      "He won the vote in Parliament on Friday with support from the main opposition People\u2019s Party. In exchange for their votes, Anutin has promised to dissolve Parliament within four months and organize a referendum on the drafting of a new constitution by an elected constituent assembly.",
      "The People\u2019s Party said it would remain part of the opposition, leaving the new government potentially a minority one.

      "Anutin became the third prime minister of Thailand in two years after the 2023 general elections. The People\u2019s Party, then named the Move Forward Party, won the most seats but was kept from power when military-appointed senators, who were strong supporters of Thailand\u2019s royalist conservative establishment, voted against the party's candidate because they opposed its policy seeking reforms to the monarchy.",

      "A New Zealand man who evaded authorities with his three children for nearly four years has been shot and killed by police",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand man who evaded authorities with his three children in remote countryside for nearly four years was shot and killed by a police officer Monday, law enforcement said.",
      "The December 2021 disappearance of Tom Phillips and his children \u2014 now about 9, 10 and 11 \u2014 confounded investigators for years as they scoured the densely forested area where they believed the family was hiding. The family was not believed to ever have traveled far from the isolated North Island rural settlement of Marokopa where they lived, but credible sightings of them were rare.",
      "Phillips has not been formally identified, New Zealand\u2019s Acting Deputy Police Commissioner Jill Rogers told reporters in the city of Hamilton on Monday, but authorities believed he was the man killed. His relatives confirmed his death to local news outlets.",
      "A police officer was shot in the head and critically injured during a confrontation with Phillips after he robbed an agricultural supplies store early Monday morning, Rogers said. A child with Phillips at the time of the burglary was taken into custody.",
      "The officer was undergoing surgery at a hospital. Further surgeries were expected.",
      "The whereabouts of Phillips' other two children was unknown and authorities held serious concerns for them, Rogers said. Acting Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders said the child taken into custody Monday was cooperating with the authorities.",
      "The farm supplies store targeted Monday was in a small town in the same sprawling farming region of Waikato, south of Auckland, as the settlement of about 40 people from where the family vanished. The case has fascinated New Zealanders and the authorities made regular unsuccessful appeals for information.",
      "Sightings of Phillips were limited to CCTV footage that showed him allegedly committing crimes in the area. He was wanted for an armed bank robbery while on the run in May 2023, accompanied by one of his children, in which he reportedly shot at a member of the public.",
      "Phillips did not have legal custody rights for his children, Saunders told reporters in 2024. Authorities feared for the children's safety and said they had not had access to formal education or health care since their disappearance.",
      "Law enforcement always believed that Phillips had help concealing his family and some residents of the isolated rural area expressed support for him. A reward of 80,000 New Zealand dollars ($47,000), large by New Zealand standards, and an offer of immunity from prosecution was offered for information about the family's whereabouts last June, but it was never paid.",
      "December 2021 was not the first time Phillips prompted national news headlines after disappearing with his children. The family went missing that September, launching a three-week land and sea search after Phillips\u2019 truck was found abandoned on a wild beach near where he lived.",

      "Iran is paving over a lot in Tehran's largest cemetery believed to be the final resting place for some of the thousands killed in the mass executions that followed the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A desert-like patch of sand and scrawny trees in the largest cemetery in Iran's capital has been the final resting place for decades for some of the thousands killed in the mass executions that followed Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Now, Lot 41 at the sprawling Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran is becoming a parking lot, with their remains likely beneath asphalt.",
      "Images from Planet Labs PBC show the parking lot being laid over the site, where opponents of Iran's nascent theocracy and others were rapidly buried following their executions at gunpoint or by hanging.",
      "The site, long monitored by surveillance cameras searching for any sign of dissent or remembrance at what officials have referred to as the \u201cscorched section,\" has seen state-sponsored demolition in the past, with grave markers vandalized and overturned. Iranian officials have acknowledged the recent decision to build the parking, without going into detail about those buried there.",
      "That's as a United Nations special rapporteur in 2024 described Iran's destruction of graveyards as an effort to \u201cconceal or erase data that could serve as potential evidence to avoid legal accountability\u201d over its actions.",
      "\u201cMost of the graves and gravestones of dissidents were desecrated, and the trees in the section were deliberately dried out,\u201d said Shahin Nasiri, a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has researched Lot 41. \u201cThe decision to convert this section into a parking lot fits into this broader pattern and represents the final phase of the destruction process.\u201d",
      "Last week, both a Tehran deputy mayor and the cemetery\u2019s manager acknowledged the plans to create a parking lot on the site.",
      "\u201cIn this place, hypocrites of the early days of the revolution were buried and it has remained without change for years,\u201d Tehran's deputy mayor Davood Goudarzi told journalists in footage aired by state television. \"We proposed that the authorities reorganize the space. Since we needed a parking lot, the permission for the preparation of the space was received. The job is ongoing in a precise and smart way.\u201d",
      "The satellite photos show the work began in earnest at the start of August. An Aug. 18 image shows about half of Lot 41 freshly paved over, with construction material still on site. Trucks and piles of asphalt can be seen at the site, suggesting work continued.",
      "The reformist newspaper Shargh quoted Mohammad Javad Tajik, who oversees the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, as saying the parking lot would help people visit a neighboring lot, where authorities plan to bury those killed in the Iran-Israel war in June.",
      "A major airstrike campaign by Israel killed prominent military generals and others, with government officials putting the death toll at more than 1,060 people killed, with an activist group putting it at over 1,190.",
      "The decision to repurpose the graveyard appears to clash with Iran's own regulations, which allow for a cemetery to repurpose land where internments took place after more than 30 years \u2014 as long as families of the dead agree with the decision.",

      "It remains unclear whether human remains sit beneath the layer of asphalt or if Iranian authorities moved the bones of the dead there. However, Iran has destroyed other graveyards in recent years for those killed in its 1988 mass execution that saw thousands put to death, leaving their bones there.",
      "Authorities have also vandalized cemeteries for the Baha'i, a religious minority in the country long targeted, and those home to protesters who have died in recent nationwide protests against Iran's theocracy from the 2009 Green Movement to the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations.",
      "\u201cImpunity for atrocities and crimes against humanity has been building for decades in the Islamic Republic,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran. \u201cThere is a direct line between the massacres of the 1980s, the gunning down of demonstrators in 2009, and the mass killings of protesters in 2019 and 2022.\"",
      "Behesht-e Zahra, or the \u201cParadise of Zahra,\u201d opened in 1970 on what was then the rural outskirts of Tehran. As hundreds of thousands of Iranians flooded into the capital under the shah as the country's oil wealth skyrocketed, pressure on Tehran's cemeteries had grown to a point that the burgeoning metropolis needed a place for all of its dead as well.",
      "The cemetery has long been a resting place for some of the most famous Iranians since \u2014 and a point where history turned for the country.",
      "On his return to Iran in 1979 after years in exile, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini traveled first to the cemetery, where some of those killed in the uprising against the shah had been buried. Khomeini's cleric courts later issued death sentences for those now interred at Lot 41.",
      "After his death in 1989, Iran built a towering, golden-domed mausoleum for Khomeini connected to the cemetery. As Behesht-e Zahra grew, Lot 41 found itself surrounded by an ever-expanding number of lots for burials.",
      "Nasiri said his research with others suggests there are 5,000 to 7,000 burial sites within Lot 41 of those Iran \u201cconsidered religious outlaws,\u201d whether communists, militants, monarchists or others.",
      "\u201cMany survivors and family members of the victims are still searching for the graves of their loved ones,\u201d Nasiri said. \u201cThey seek justice and aim to hold the perpetrators accountable. The deliberate destruction of these burial sites adds an additional obstacle to efforts of truth-finding and the pursuit of historical justice.\u201d",

      "Nigel Farage has made a bold pitch to his Reform UK party, echoing themes that helped Donald Trump rise to power",
      "LONDON -- The political pitch sounded familiar: The country is in crisis. The government must slash immigration, crack down on crime, ditch green energy targets and reopen factories to \u201cmake Britain great again.\u201d",
      "The words of Nigel Farage to his Reform UK party\u2019s two-day annual convention echoed themes that propelled U.S. President Donald Trump back to the White House.",
      "Farage, the veteran hard-right politician, hopes a similar strategy can make him prime minister \u2013 a once-unthinkable idea that allies and opponents alike are taking seriously.",
      "\u201cIf an election were held now, Reform would be the largest party by far, albeit probably short of an overall majority,\u201d John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, wrote on the BBC website. \u201cThe question hanging over the party is - can they sustain this?\u201d",
      "Farage played a major role in taking the U.K. out of the European Union in 2020, but has never held political power. He has led a succession of small, fractious parties and only became a lawmaker in 2024 after seven failed attempts to get elected to Parliament.",
      "Reform U.K. has only four lawmakers out of 650 in the House of Commons and got about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election. But for months it has led opinion polls, ahead of the center-left governing Labour Party and the main opposition Conservatives, which Reform aims to replace as Britain\u2019s major party on the political right.",
      "\u201cOur country is in a very bad place,\u201d Farage told delegates at the convention, which ends Saturday in Birmingham, central England. \u201cWe are the last chance the country has got to get this country back on track.\u201d",
      "Founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, Reform now claims to have 240,000 members. In May, it won control of a dozen local authorities in England with Trump-like promises like \u201ca DOGE for every county,\u201d inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s controversial spending-slashing agency.",
      "Farage made the most of Parliament\u2019s summer recess, when many politicians go on vacation, by holding regular news conferences to announce headline-grabbing policies like a plan to deport everyone who arrives in Britain without authorization.",
      "He has capitalized on \u2014 critics say stoked \u2014 concerns about migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, which he has called an invasion. He welcomed protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers over the summer, some of which turned violent.",
      "Opponents say Farage has demonized migrants and fueled misinformation. Last year, he inaccurately suggested police were withholding information about a stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three children dead. False claims that the attacker was an asylum-seeker sparked days of rioting across England.",
      "Reform\u2019s success in May\u2019s local elections has brought responsibilities that will test the party\u2019s competence and popularity.",
      "Some of the positions he shares with Trump, such as opposition to net-zero climate goals, are unpopular in Britain. Past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin could also be a disadvantage in a country where most people back Ukraine in its war against Moscow\u2019s invasion.",

      "Both the Conservatives and Labour are struggling to respond to Reform\u2019s rise. Starmer has been criticized for not confronting the far-right party more strongly, instead seeming to agree with some of its talking points about immigration. In a May speech, Starmer said Britain risked becoming an \u201cisland of strangers,\u201d a phrase that some felt echoed Conservative politician Enoch Powell\u2019s notorious 1968 speech predicting \u201crivers of blood\u201d as a result of mass immigration.",

      "Pope Leo XIV will preside over his first canonization ceremony Sunday to create the first millennial saint",
      "CHICAGO -- At a Catholic school in Pope Leo XIV\u2019s hometown, fifth graders read comic books about Carlo Acutis' life entitled \u201cDigital Disciple.\u201d They draw pictures of what the teenage Italian computer whiz might have had as his cellphone wallpaper. They discuss the miracles that allegedly occurred thanks to Acutis' intercession.",
      "In the run-up to Acutis' canonization Sunday, it is all Acutis, all the time at the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish and school in Chicago. The parish was the first in the United States to take its name from Acutis, who died in 2006 at age 15 and is about to become history's first millennial saint.",
      "In recent years, Acutis has shot to near rockstar-like fame among many young Catholics, generating a global following the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn\u2019t seen in ages. Much of that popularity is thanks to a concerted campaign by the Vatican to give the next generation of faithful a relatable, modern-day role model, who used his technological talents to spread the faith.",
      "He\u2019s not a world figure like Mother Teresa or St. John Paul II, but rather a \u201csaint next door,\u201d said the Rev. Ed Howe, the pastor at Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago\u2019s Northwest Side. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who I think a lot of young people today say, \u2018I could be the saint next door.'\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, will declare Acutis a saint Sunday in his first canonization ceremony, alongside another popular Italian, Pier Giorgio Frassati. Both ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year but were postponed following the death in April of Pope Francis.",
      "It was Francis who had fervently willed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to church while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",
      "Acutis was precociously savvy with computers before the social media era, reading college-level textbooks on programming and coding as a youngster. But he limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones.",
      "\u201cCarlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\u201d Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \u201cYet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\u201d",
      "Leo inherited the Acutis cause, but he too has pointed to technology \u2014 especially artificial intelligence \u2014 as one of the main challenges facing humanity.",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things, a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me because from a very early age he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\u201d said Sona Harrison, an 8th grader at the St. John Berchmans\u2019 school, which is part of the Acutis parish. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s a lot more relatable and I definitely feel like I\u2019m closer to God when I read about him.\u201d",
      "Acutis earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d because he used technology to spread the faith. His most well-known tech legacy is the website he created about so-called Eucharistic miracles, available in nearly 20 different languages. The site compiles information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events over the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\u201cThis was the fixed appointment of his day,\u201d his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that was airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to Salzano and Andrea Acutis \u2014 a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",

Those who can\u2019t make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of Internet accessibility not afforded to even popes buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.",
      "Kathleen Sprows Cummings, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, said Acutis\u2019 enormous popularity was clearly the result of a concerted church campaign, pushed strongly by his grief-stricken mother. But she said that is nothing new, and that in the 2,000-year history of the church, saints have very often been pushed ahead to respond to a particular need at a particular time.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t detract from the holiness of the person being honored to say that there are choices that are made,\u201d about which cases move forward, she said in a telephone interview.",
      "Sprows Cummings said the Acutis phenomenon caught on because he is attractive to both young people and the institutional church, because he used technology in a positive way to spread his profound belief in Eucharistic miracles at a time when many Catholics don\u2019t believe that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist.",
      "\u201cCanonization is about marketing,\u201d said Sprows Cummings, author of \u201cA Saint of Our Own: How the Quest for a Holy Hero Helped Catholics become American.\u201d \u201cWhich stories are going to get told? Who is going to get remembered through this amazingly efficient way of remembering holy people?\u201d",
      "Acutis and his story are ever-present here. During Mass this week ahead of the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have had: a soccer ball, laptop and knapsack. Howe, the parish pastor and priest of the Congregation of the Resurrection, pulled items out of the knapsack to explain Acutis' story to the youngest students seated up front: A can of food he might have given to a homeless person, a set of Rosary beads he might have prayed with.",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

      "India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",
      "Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.",
      "According to India\u2019s renewable energy ministry, the country\u2019s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from 9 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is transforming call centers by streamlining tasks and improving customer service",
      "NEW YORK -- Armen Kirakosian remembers the frustrations of his first job as a call center agent nearly 10 years ago: the aggravated customers, the constant searching through menus for information and the notes he had to physically write for each call he handled.",
      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The call center customer's experience, while improved, is still far from perfect.",
      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is coming out with its \u201cChatGPT Agent\u201d service for users that\u2019s able to understand phrases like \u201cI need to find a hotel for a wedding next year, please give me options for clothing and gifts.\u201d",
      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're getting to the point where AI will get you to the right person for your problem without you having to route through those menus,\u201d Bednar said.",

      "Cork comes from the spongy bark of the cork oak tree, which is primarily grown and harvested in the Mediterranean basin. The framework trade agreement between the United States and the European Union singled out the material as an \u201cunavailable natural product.\u201d So as of Sept. 1, cork joined a handful of other items, including airplanes and generic pharmaceuticals, that are exempt from a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU products.",
      "The cork carve-out was vital for Portugal. The European country is the world\u2019s largest cork producer, accounting for about half of global production.",
      "Portuguese diplomats lobbied for the exemption on both sides of the Atlantic. Patrick Spencer, the executive director of the U.S.-based Natural Cork Council, raced from Salem, Oregon, to Washington in June to explain cork\u2019s origins to U.S. trade officials and to seek a tariff reprieve. The Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, said it also pushed for the special dispensation.",
      "Spencer said he was thrilled when a summary of the U.S.-EU agreement released in August mentioned cork.",
      "\u201cIt was a great day in our neighborhood,\u201d said Spencer, a self-described \u201ccork dork.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if cork is unique or if other natural products will be exempt from U.S. tariffs in future trade agreements. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond when The Associated Press asked about tariff exemptions.",
      "It\u2019s not even clear if the tariffs President Donald Trump put on imports from the EU's 27 member nations and almost every country will remain. Late last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump had no right to impose his sweeping tariffs, although it left them in place while his administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But if the tariffs stay in place, cork may signal other exemptions to come. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated during a July interview with CNBC that natural products like mangoes or cocoa may be free from tariffs",
      "The U.S. is the second-largest market for Portuguese cork after France. In 2023, the U.S. imported $241 million worth of cork from Portugal; just over 70% of it came in the form of stoppers for wine, spirits, olive oil, honey and other liquids, according to the Natural Cork Council, a trade group.",
      "Cork has other applications, too. NASA and SpaceX have used it for thermal protection on rockets. Cork crumbles are also used as infill for sports fields and inserted into concrete on airport runways to help absorb the shock of plane landings.",
      "Even though California has a similar climate to the Mediterranean, the U.S. has never developed a cork industry. There was an attempt to start one during World War II, and around 500 cork oaks from that period remain on the campus of the University of California, Davis.",
      "But the effort evaporated when the war ended. The problem: it takes 25 years for a cork tree to produce its first bark for harvesting, and the initial yield typically isn\u2019t high quality. After that, it takes the tree about nine years to grow new bark.",
      "\u201cAmericans are not patient enough to wait for a tree that takes 25 years to give its first harvest,\u201d said Antonio Amorim, the chairman and CEO of Portugal\u2019s Corticeira Amorim, one of the world\u2019s largest cork companies.",

      "Cork harvesting is also an extremely specialized skill, since cutting into a tree the wrong way could kill it. Cork harvesters are the highest paid agricultural workers in Europe, Spencer said.",
      "Amorim, which exports cork to more than 100 countries, has more than 20 million cork trees spread over 700,000 hectares (1.7 million acres) of woodland.",
      "On a recent day at Amorim\u2019s Herdade de Rio Frio, a farm 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Lisbon, crews zig-zagged across the thin, pale grass between scattered cork trees, kicking up dust.",
      "The quiet woodland echoed with the gentle thud of the workers\u2019 axes. They gently pierced the bark, feeling for the thickness of cork that could be peeled off without harming the trunk. The Portuguese have harvested cork this way for more than 200 years.",
      "The tree bark came off in featherweight slabs that the workers, their hands black from the oaks' natural tannins, tossed onto a flatbed truck. It would go to factories to be cut into strips and fed into a machine that punches out stoppers.",
      "Once the trees were bare, a woman painted a white \u201c5\u201d on the orange-colored trunks, signaling they were stripped in 2025. Herdade de Rio Frio's cork oaks, which are native to Portugal and can resist frequent droughts and scorching summer temperatures, were planted more than 100 years ago.",
      "Cork\u2019s sustainable harvesting process and its biodegradability are two reasons many U.S. winemakers have returned to plugging bottles with it after experimenting with closures made of aluminum, plastic and glass. In 2010, 53% of premium U.S. wines used cork stoppers; by 2022, that had risen to 64.5%, according to the Natural Cork Council.",
      "Cork taint, which gives wine a funky taste and is caused by a fungus in natural corks, was a big problem in the 1990s, and it pushed many vintners into aluminum screw caps and other closures, said Andrew Waterhouse, a chemist and director of the Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis.",
      "The cork industry has largely solved that problem, Waterhouse said. In the meantime, the wine industry came up with new technology, like screw caps that can mimic cork in the amount of oxygen they let into a bottle over time.",
      "Many wineries, including Trump Winery in Virginia, now use both screw caps and natural corks. Waterhouse said screw caps generally make more sense for a wine like ros\u00e9, which isn\u2019t intended to age, while cork is the standard for aging wines.",
      "\u201cIf you say, \u2018Has this wine aged properly?,\u2019 what you mean is, \u2018Was it in a glass bottle with a cork seal in a cool cellar?\u2019 Under any other conditions, it didn\u2019t age the same,\u201d Waterhouse said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trapped by history.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Fox News seemed to be dealt a crippling blow in a $787 million settlement of a libel lawsuit more than two years ago, but has instead thrived",
      "NEW YORK -- Twice recently, the people who run Fox News were reminded of their biggest nightmare.",
      "The conservative network Newsmax's $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over false claims after the 2020 election recalled Fox's own $787.5 million deal with the same company more than two years ago. New legal papers filed last month by a second company suing Fox, Smartmatic, also put an episode they would like to forget back in the news.",
      "Between the staggering payment to bypass a defamation trial and revelations about the lengths to which Fox went to avoid telling its audience what it didn't want to hear about Donald Trump's defeat, many wondered if its actions in November 2020 would damage Fox News or compel it to change directions.",
      "Not so much, it turns out.",
      "Fox News Channel has defied gravity with its ratings, and is more popular with viewers this summer than ABC, CBS or NBC. Its top personalities resolutely support Trump, who has filled his second administration with former Fox stars like Pete Hegseth and Jeanine Pirro. Time after time, the White House turns to Fox to make news; shortly after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was sitting with Sean Hannity.",
      "Reached by The Associated Press, Fox declined to make anyone available to speak for this story.",
      "An ethos many at Fox share with the president \u2014 no expressed regrets, no apologies \u2014 has also shown signs of spreading, given Newsmax's swagger following the Aug. 11 settlement announcement.",
      "Fox News averaged 2.63 million viewers in weekday prime-time for the second quarter of 2025, up 56% from the same period in 2023, the Nielsen company said. While the increase is somewhat inflated since Fox took a hit in the ratings two years ago following the firing of Tucker Carlson, the advance of cord-cutting means that any network gaining viewers now is unusual.",
      "MSNBC's prime-time audience of 1 million this spring was down 21% in two years, and CNN's viewership of 538,000 was down 6%, Nielsen said. Forty-five percent of people watching one of the top three cable news networks at any given time two years ago were tuned to Fox. This year, that audience share jumped to 62%.",
      "Clearly, Fox's audience is more interested in following a Trump administration than it was for a Joe Biden administration. Just as clearly, the Dominion case had little appreciable impact on viewership.",
      "\u201cFox's audience didn't really look at that verdict and say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t watch them anymore,'\u201d said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cI think Fox's audience looked at that and said, \u2018oh, the left is coming after them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Financially, the Dominion settlement was stiff enough that Newsmax is spreading its payments out over three years. The much larger Fox had a greater ability to absorb its hit. Fox confirmed at the time that it could deduct the settlement from its income taxes, and insurance could make the payment lower. Meanwhile, Fox News is a profit engine and becoming even more so; Axios reported earlier this year that the company expected to make half a billion dollars on non-TV products like books, podcasts and streaming.",
      "Carlson was the face of the network before he was fired shortly after the settlement was announced, but Fox has always been able to generate new stars. Carlson took over from Bill O'Reilly when he was fired in 2017. Fox started \u201cThe Five,\u201d arguably its centerpiece show, when Glenn Beck was shown the door in 2011. Jesse Watters now owns Carlson and O'Reilly's old time slot.",
      "Yet, it's hard to understate the worry many at Fox had about losing audience immediately following the 2020 election. Trump, and many of his fans, were angry that the network declared Biden the winner in Arizona before most news outlets, a pivotal moment in the vote-counting.",
      "Internal messages and deposition interviews revealed in court papers tied to Smartmatic's lawsuit reveal much of that drama. Management criticized anchor Neil Cavuto for ordering his show to cut away from Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she began talking about election fraud. News reporters were disciplined for fact-checking some of Trump's claims. Many in Fox's audience expressed anger at hearing Trump corrected and wanted to hear conspiracy theories.",
      "Cavuto left Fox after 28 years last December. McEnany is now a co-host of Fox's midday show, \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, hosts a weekend show at Fox.",

      "Former Fox politics editor Chris Stirewalt, who was fired by Fox shortly after the network's correct call in Arizona, identified in a Smartmatic deposition a programming strategy that Fox excels at. \u201cThe best way to capture an audience is to make them afraid, make them fearful of something \u2014 to make them hate or resent other people to try to keep them with your telecast and that they're afraid to change the channel,\u201d he said.",
      "Fox has also maintained its dominance by playing a form of hardball that Newsmax alleged, in a lawsuit filed this week, violates antitrust laws. Newsmax said Fox has tried to block television distributors from carrying its rival, hired private detectives to investigate Newsmax executives and pressured guests not to appear on the network.",
      "In response, Fox said, \u201cNewsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic said Fox has never retracted, or apologized for, programs that falsely suggested the company was involved in changing votes in 2020. Fox, which would not make an executive available for this story, said fraud charges made by a president or his representatives were newsworthy, and the network is defending itself on free speech grounds.",
      "Newsmax has twice publicly expressed some regrets about its postelection coverage. The network settled a lawsuit with Smartmatic in 2024.",
      "In a statement aired on Newsmax in December 2020, the network said that \u201cno evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d The following April, Newsmax apologized for airing false allegations that a Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, manipulated voting machines or tallies to the detriment of Trump in 2020. Coomer, in turn, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.",
      "According to court papers in the case, Newsmax executive Gary Kanofsky wrote about conspiracy theorists to a colleague shortly after the election: \u201cSimply giving them a microphone to spew more anti-election rhetoric and advance their claims without being properly equipped to question the legitimacy or factual accuracy of their assertions may be fun, but it\u2019s terrible journalism.\u201d",
      "But Newsmax offered no apology in making the Dominion settlement, announced Aug. 11. The network's CEO, Chris Ruddy, attacked the judge, saying he \u201ceffectively entered a confiscation of our property because our reporting was not always sympathetic to Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "The network said on the air: \u201cNewsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020. We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\u201d",
      "What has changed? Newsmax has grown, and two months after Trump took office again, it went public. It invites members of its audience \u2014 dominated by Trump fans \u2014 to invest in the network.",
      "\u201cIf you're paying attention to your audience at Newsmax,\u201d Graham said, \u201cyou don't want to give the impression that you're knuckling under.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",
      "Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.",

      "Kempczinski also noted that in many states, sit-down restaurants are allowed to pay servers as little as $2.13 per hour, a federal minimum set in 1991, with tips making up the rest of their pay.",
      "\u201cSo right now, there\u2019s an uneven playing field. If you are a restaurant that allows tips or has tips as part of your equation, you\u2019re essentially getting the customer to pay for your labor and you\u2019re getting an extra benefit from no taxes on tips,\u201d Kempczinski said.",

      "As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can't afford consistent air conditioning in deadly heat",
      "NEW YORK -- As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation and summers grow deadlier, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can\u2019t afford consistent air conditioning in dangerous temperatures.",
      "While about half of U.S. states offer protections from utility shutoffs during extreme heat, the rest do not. In contrast, 41 states have \u201ccold weather rules,\u201d which forbid utility companies from shutting off household heat during extreme cold. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funds for vulnerable groups who have trouble affording heating bills in the winter, but the program has less funding available to meet consumers' increasing needs in the summer months.",
      "Shylee Johnson, 27, based in Wichita, Kansas, saw firsthand the protection that the local Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) brought to her community during the three years she worked as a case manager for families who were behind on utility bills.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing at keeping people's electricity on in the winter,\u201d she said of the program, which subsidizes costs for households who can't afford utility expenses. \u201cFamilies would be deciding between paying their heating bill or another bill, and this took that decision away.\u201d",
      "In the summer, though, Johnson said she's seen how late or missed utility payments can result in the shutoff of electricity and the removal of vital services, despite air conditioning becoming increasingly essential to families' health and well-being.",
      "\u201cIt's terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's a \u2018cold weather rule\u2019 \u2014 in freezing temperatures, your heat can't be turned off. But there isn't an equivalent for summer in Kansas.\"",
      "The clients Johnson served were often the most vulnerable, including families with young children, pregnant people, and those with sick or disabled family members, including some who need electricity to operate essential medical equipment in their homes. LIHEAP also sometimes provides air conditioning units in the summer for households that can't afford to purchase their own units.",
      "Recent studies show that extreme heat in the summer is now the leading cause of weather-related deaths, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That's ahead of deaths due to extreme cold in the winter or other weather emergencies, like hurricanes or tornadoes. The frequency, duration and intensity of extreme heat waves has significantly increased over the past several decades, according to the EPA, and insignificant support for low-income households contributes to the danger.",
      "In 2023, the death certificates of more than 2,300 people who died in the summer mention the effects of excessive heat, the highest number in 45 years of records, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. And that figure is only a fraction of the real death toll, according to coroner, hospital, and ambulance records, also analyzed by the AP.",
      "Nationally, the cost of electricity has risen at twice the pace of the average cost of living, exacerbating the problem.",
      "According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents state program managers of LIHEAP, almost 20% of very low-income families lack consistent access to cooling. Currently, 26 states and the District of Columbia offer assistance with summer energy bills, while 21 states plus D.C. have policies protecting low-income families from utility disconnections during summer months.",
      "Still, roughly 85% of LIHEAP resources are used for heating in the winter, leaving little support for households seeking cooling, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA.",

      "Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who focuses on energy and utility affordability, said that many deaths from extreme heat in the summer months are preventable.",
      "\u201cThe impression we\u2019ve all had is that weather is most dangerous in the wintertime,\u201d she said. \u201cNot any more.\u201d",
      "While the Trump administration fired the entire staff of the LIHEAP program in April, Wolfe and Lusson are hopeful Congress will approve slightly more funding for the program in the fall compared to the previous fiscal year, they said.",
      "To protect households during increasingly hotter summers, Lusson recommends individuals seek information about their rights when it comes to utility shutoffs. State utility commissions, which regulate public utilities, dictate local rules. To find your relevant commission, consult the government site operated by the national association of regulatory commissions, which has a state-by-state look-up tool.",
      "Lusson also encourages people to look into whether their state protections are calendar- or temperature-based, which can make a difference in planning. While some states forbid shut-offs during certain months of the year, others base the protections on the temperature of a given day or the presence of a heat advisory. This LIHEAP site has a break-down of every state's policies.",
      "Some state attorney generals' offices also have public utility bureaus that advocate on behalf of consumers, Lusson said.",
      "Lastly, it can be helpful to determine if your utility company offers discount rates or percentage-of-income payment plans to help with electricity bills. Both commission and utility websites have specific information about how to access LIHEAP assistance and whether or not the utility company itself offers assistance.",

      "OREFIELD, Pa. -- In a romance and adventure worthy of the big screen, a Pennsylvania couple is preserving the past and forging a future as the owners of the world\u2019s oldest operating drive-in movie theater.",
      "Lauren McChesney got more than admission to a double feature when she handed her ticket to Matt McClanahan at a different drive-in he managed in 2018. They started dating a year later, and, in August, got engaged. In between, they purchased Shankweiler\u2019s Drive-In Theatre, which was Pennsylvania\u2019s first drive-in and only the nation\u2019s second when it opened in 1934.",
      "The couple began brainstorming about drive-ins during a cross-country road trip that included stops at both operational and abandoned theaters. Their original goal was to open a new drive-in, but when they learned Shankweiler's might get sold to developers, \u201cthe light bulb went off,\u201d McClanahan said.",
      "\u201cWhy are we spending so much time trying to build one when there\u2019s one literally down the road from our house that\u2019s for sale and is like the most important drive-in?\u201d he said.",
      "The drive-in movie theater industry began in Camden, New Jersey, in 1933 and peaked in the late 1950s, with more than 4,000 drive-ins, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association. The numbers dropped rapidly in the 1970s and 80s as other entertainment options increased, along with land values that made selling for redevelopment attractive. Though popular during the pandemic, by 2024, there were only 283 left, according to the association.",
      "McClanahan, 35, who grew up going to Shankweiler\u2019s, had managed another drive-in and started a mobile movie business during the coronavirus pandemic. In contrast, McChesney, 41, had never been to a drive-in before 2018, and she left a stable corporate job in the health care industry to take on this new venture. Buying Shankweiler's was a risk for both of them \u2014 they pooled their savings and secured a $1 million loan to buy the drive-in in 2022 \u2014 but one they say has paid off.",
      "\u201cThis was an undertaking that was leaps and bounds bigger than anything I\u2019d ever done in my life, in terms of investment, monthly expenses, and debt,\u201d McClanahan said. \u201cIt still feels surreal when I think about it.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve built a successful business with the help of strong summer attendance, the occasional big-name film like \u201cWicked,\u201d and special events like Valentine\u2019s Day \u201cdate night\u201d screenings of \u201cThe Notebook.\u201d The drive-in is open seven days a week from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and Thursdays through Sundays the rest of the year. Tickets are $9 for children and $13 for adults.",
      "Ken Querio, 52, of Kutztown, Pennsylvania, has been going to Shankweiler\u2019s since he was a teenager. He made a point to seek out the owners before a recent viewing of \u201cJaws.\u201d",

      "C-SPAN's three public affairs networks will be carried beginning this fall on YouTube TV and Hulu's live television package, according to a deal announced on Wednesday",
      "NEW YORK -- C-SPAN said Wednesday that it had reached a deal to have its three channels air on YouTube TV and Hulu's live television feed, ending a dispute that had led to a revenue squeeze for the public affairs network in the cord-cutting era.",
      "The network said the streaming services would pay the same fee as cable and satellite companies, roughly 87 cents a year per subscriber, and that C-SPAN would continue its no-advertising policy on television.",
      "Congress involved itself in the issue, passing a resolution this spring calling on the services' parent companies \u2014 Alphabet for YouTube and Disney for Hulu \u2014 to add C-SPAN to their programming mix. Because congressional sessions and hearings represent a big portion of C-SPAN's programming, the politicians faced diminished airtime without a deal.",
      "At its peak a decade ago, C-SPAN was seen in some 100 million homes with television. The number of homes paying for TV has since dropped to some 70 million, with roughly 20 million of those consumers now getting television through services like YouTube and Hulu, and they weren't showing C-SPAN.",
      "C-SPAN said its revenues had dropped from nearly $64 million in 2019 to $45.4 million in 2023.",

      "Missouri defeats Kansas in a thrilling renewal of their historic football rivalry, winning 42-31",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Kevin Coleman Jr. is on his fourth school in four years, yet it's the one that brought him closest to home. The wide receiver grew up in St. Louis, a couple hours east of the Missouri campus, and was well-versed in the Tigers' longtime rivalry with Kansas.",
      "To beat the Jayhawks in the renewal of the Border War?",
      "\u201cIt meant everything to win this game,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Beau Pribula threw for 334 yards and three touchdowns, Jamal Roberts ran for 143 yards and the clinching score, while Coleman had a big game himself to help the Tigers rally for a 42-31 victory over the Jayhawks on Saturday.",
      "The bitter series, which began in 1891 and remains among the most-played in Division I football, had been on hiatus since 2011, when Missouri bolted from the Big 12 for the SEC. Officials at Kansas vowed at the time they would never play again, since the move in part put its conference on shaky footing. It wasn't until recently that the schools began playing in other sports.",
      "Yet the 121st meeting of the schools on the gridiron did not take place until Saturday.",
      "And it lived up to the expectations.",
      "Kansas raced to a 21-6 lead. Missouri (2-0) countered with a big second quarter to forge a 21-all tie by halftime. The lead swung back and forth over the final 30 minutes, with the Jayhawks pulling ahead 31-28 with 8:45 left and the Tigers rattling off two scores in the closing minutes to win the \u201cwar drum\u201d that is awarded to the victors.",
      "\u201cGrowing up a Mizzou kid, you always heard about this game and how big it is,\u201d said Missouri tight end Brett Norfleet, who also grew up in the St. Louis area, and whose second touchdown reception gave his team the lead for good.",
      "\u201cThere's a certain level of passion to it,\u201d Norfleet said. \u201cIt's playing for the guy to the left and right of you, and it's also playing for the past teams that have played KU, and not letting them down.\u201d",
      "Want proof of the animosity harbored by the fanbases? At one point, Missouri officials brought a fan wearing a white T-shirt down to the field to try a 45-yard field goal for $25,000. He turned and kicked the ball at the Kansas bench instead, then lifted up his shirt to reveal a \u2014 well, a pointed message about KU painted in black letters on his chest.",

      "\u201cWhen we rolled up to the game today, I saw so many Mizzou fans, more than I've ever seen,\u201d Norfleet said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we're trying to block out the noise, right? But I mean, I think it's good. I think it's good for both schools to play each year.\u201d",
      "Even those without a long-standing stake in the rivalry knew the importance of it. That included Pribula, the Penn State transfer, who grew up in Pennsylvania \u2014 about as far as you can get away from the Midwest. He showed the kind of moxie and desire that has become such a big part of the rivalry, and was so important for the Tigers down the stretch on Saturday.",
      "Twice, the QB exuded poise and confidence in converting fourth downs as Missouri was trying to rally for the go-ahead score.",
      "\u201cIt's not just me. We have a lot of really good leaders on this team,\u201d Pribula said, \"and I thought that showed up big-time for us.\"",
      "The Jayhawks (2-1) showed plenty of fight, too. They bounced right back when Missouri scored early in the game, and they did the same after halftime, when momentum was firmly on the other side and the game was getting away form them.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot around it,\u201d Kansas coach Lance Leipold said, \u201cbut at the same time, we're two teams playing. We wanted a good, clean football game that was highly competitive. ... And we got it. I thought it was intense, obviously. A lot of enthusiasm and emotions on both sides. I thought it was a great atmosphere here. Just disappoitned where it ended up.\u201d",

      "Artificial intelligence is transforming call centers by streamlining tasks and improving customer service",
      "NEW YORK -- Armen Kirakosian remembers the frustrations of his first job as a call center agent nearly 10 years ago: the aggravated customers, the constant searching through menus for information and the notes he had to physically write for each call he handled.",
      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu.

      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",

      "Scientists conducting a first-of-its-kind drilling operation have extracted samples of fresh water hiding in massive reservoirs deep under the ocean",
      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",

      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",

      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",

      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",

      "A congressional investigation finds the Pentagon has funded research involving collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense sector",
      "WASHINGTON -- Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.",
      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",

The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "LONDON -- European Union regulators on Friday hit Google with a 2.95 billion euro ($3.5 billion) fine for breaching the bloc\u2019s competition rules by favoring its own digital advertising services, marking the fourth such antitrust penalty for the company.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, also ordered the U.S. tech giant to end its \u201cself-preferencing practices\u201d and take steps to stop \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d along the advertising technology supply chain.",

      "IRVING, Texas -- Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.",
      "The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.",
      "\u201cOh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,\u201d said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.",

School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala\u2019s higher grades \u2014 whose students joined before it was a STEM school \u2014 some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.",

But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys' scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.",
      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",

      "In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP's analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",

Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",

It can't leak or file suit. It does make mistakes, a credibility problem that makes it hard to determine fact from fiction in the age of mis- and disinformation.",

Trump issued a rare apology (\"if anyone was offended\") in 2016 for his comments about touching women without their consent on the notorious \u201cAccess Hollywood\" tape.

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "\u201cOur results suggest that Mars has a solid inner core making up about one-fifth of the planet\u2019s radius \u2014 roughly the same proportion as Earth\u2019s inner core. However, this similarity may be just coincidental,\u201d Sun said.",
      "While praising the results, the University of Maryland\u2019s Nicholas Schmerr, who was not involved in the study, said questions regarding Mars\u2019 core are far from settled. With InSight out of action, there will be no new recordings of marsquakes to further reveal the red planet\u2019s insides, he noted.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of details about the exact shape of the inner core and composition of the inner and outer core of Mars that will require a network of InSight like seismometer stations to resolve,\u201d Schmerr said in an email.",
      "More detailed modeling is necessary to develop a clearer picture of how the inner core formed and \"what it reveals about the history of Mars' magnetic field,\u201d said Sun.",
      "At present, Mars lacks a magnetic field, possibly because of the slow crystallization of the planet's solid core, Schmerr added.",

That means the total damages awarded in the five-year-old case works out to about $4 per device.",

      "The lawyers who filed the case had argued Google had used the data they collected off smartphones without users' permission to help sell ads tailored to users' individual interests \u2014 a strategy that resulted in the company reaping billions in additional revenue. The lawyers framed those ad sales as illegal profiteering that merited damages of more than $30 billion.",

      "If you have trouble finding dates, spare a thought for Ned, a perfectly nice snail with dire romantic prospects",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",
      "Ned\u2019s shell coils to the left, not the right, making him the 1 in 40,000 snails whose sex organs don\u2019t line up with those of the rest of their species. Unless another lefty snail is found, the young gastropod faces a lifetime of unintentional celibacy.",
      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "Azerbaijan said the aircraft was hit by fire from the ground over southern Russia and rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.",
      "Russian officials said that at the time the aircraft was preparing to land in Grozny, Ukrainian drones were targeting the area around the airport.",
      "Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov said von der Leyen's plane was not specifically targeted and called the jamming a \u201cside effect\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it recorded 820 cases of interference with satellite signals in 2024, compared to 26 in 2022, and warned that the areas affected have recently \u201cexpanded significantly.\"",

      "In July, Lithuanian media reported that two German tourists accidentally flew a light aircraft into Russia and had to be guided back to Lithuania by experienced pilots.",
      "Several states have complained about the electronic interference to the International Civil Aviation Organization but Russian officials dismissed the complaints and suggested they were politically motivated.",
      "While jamming and spoofing were initially aimed at protecting Russian infrastructure, authorities have realized the tactics have a useful \u201csecond order of effect, which is that it creates disruption and disquiet among the nations President (Vladimir) Putin perceives as being his enemy,\u201d said Withington.",
      "While countries along Russia's border appear to have largely mitigated the impact of Russian jamming in the air, there is potential for a serious incident at sea.",
      "While sailors should rely on radar and charts, as well as GPS, to navigate, \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d suggests some crews are \u201clazy,\u201d and just rely on GPS, said Withington.",

      "Churches citywide are turning up their response from the pulpit.",
      "CHICAGO -- The Rev. Marshall Hatch urged congregants of a prominent Black church on Chicago\u2019s West Side to carry identification, stay connected to family and protest as the city readied for an expected federal intervention.",
      "\u201cYou need to start telling people about your whereabouts, so you don\u2019t disappear,\u201d Hatch said during Sunday services at New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to despair. We\u2019re not going to feel threatened. We\u2019re not going to give up and give in to fascism and authoritarianism.\u201d",
      "As Chicago braced for an immigration enforcement crackdown and a possible National Guard deployment, churches across the city turned up their response from the pulpit. Some worked to quell fears about detention and deportation while others addressed the looming possibility of more law enforcement on the streets of the nation\u2019s third-largest city.",
      "President Donald Trump has threatened federal intervention in Democratic strongholds, most recently warning apocalyptic force could be used in Chicago to fight crime and step up deportations. He\u2019s repeatedly cited the expected plans over fierce objections from local leaders and many residents who call it unnecessary and unwanted.",
      "While fears have been high in immigrant circles since Trump took office the second time, the threat of more federal agencies and troops has also inflamed tensions, particularly in Black and Latino communities where trust in police is fragile.",
      "Among the church attendees was Lester Burks, a 74-year-old U.S. Army veteran who said a military presence in Chicago would be threatening.",

Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that federal law enforcement action will come to Chicago this week.

      "The operation was the latest a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.

Some departments have used tax revenue from legal marijuana sales and property seizures to fund their ice cream operations.",

      "President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open on Sunday, drawing boos from the crowd",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump was loudly booed at the men's final of the U.S. Open on Sunday, where extra security caused by his visit led to lines long enough that many people missed the start of play, even after organizers delayed it.",
      "Wearing a suit and long, red tie, Trump briefly emerged from his suite about 45 minutes before the match started and heard a mix of boos and cheers from an Arthur Ashe Stadium that was still mostly empty. No announcement proceeded his appearance, and it was brief enough that some in the crowd missed it.",
      "Trump appeared again to more boos before the National Anthem. Standing in salute, the president was shown briefly on the arena's big screens during the anthem, and offered a smirk that briefly made the boos louder.",
      "When the anthem was over, the Republican pointed to a small group of supporters seated nearby, then sat on the suite's balcony to watch the match intently. He mostly didn't applaud, even following major points that energized the rest of the crowd as Spain's Carlos Alcaraz bested Jannik Sinner of Italy.",
      "Trump was shown on the big screen again after the first set ended, and elicited a roar of louder boos and some piercing whistles. He raised his left fist in salute as the noise continued in the stadium, which with a capacity of 24,000 is one of the largest in tennis.",
      "The president later moved back inside the suite, where he was seen seated at a table with family members and appeared to be eating, but he was back in his seat shortly before match point. Cameras briefly flashed on Trump as Alcaraz celebrated, but his reaction to the conclusion was as muted as it had been throughout most of the match. This time, there was little crowd reaction, too.",
      "Organizers pushed the start of the match back half an hour to give people more time to pass through enhanced screening checkpoints reminiscent of security at airports. Still, thousands of increasingly frustrated fans remained in line outside as the match got underway. Many seats, especially those in upper rows, stayed empty for nearly an hour.",
      "The Secret Service issued a statement saying that protecting Trump \u201crequired a comprehensive effort\u201d and noting that it \u201cmay have contributed to delays for attendees.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe sincerely thank every fan for their patience and understanding,\u201d it said.",
      "Trump attended the final as a guest of Rolex, despite imposing steep tariffs on the Swiss watchmaker's home country. The U.S. Tennis Association also tried to limit negative reaction to Trump's attendance being shown on ABC\u2019s national telecast, saying in a statement before play began: \"We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions.\u201d",
      "The reactions to Trump didn't ultimately constitute big disruptions, though.",
      "Going to the U.S. Open was the latest example of Trump having built the bulk of his second term\u2019s domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January and prior to Sunday\u2019s U.S Open swing, Trump has gone to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Some of those crowds cheered him, but people booed him at other events.",

      "The president accepted Rolex\u2019s invitation despite his administration imposing a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products. That's more than 2 1/2 times higher than levies on European Union goods exported to the U.S. and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the U.S.",
      "The White House declined to comment on Trump accepting a corporate client's invitation at the tournament, but the president has had few qualms about blurring lines between political and foreign policy decisions and efforts to boost the profits of his family business. He's tirelessly promoted his cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties, and even announced that the U.S. will host the Group of 20 summit in December 2026 at his Doral golf resort in Florida.",
      "No large street protests against Trump could be seen from the tournament's main stadium on Sunday. But attendees also steered clear of wearing any of the the Republican's signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps.",
      "A 58-year-old tennis fan originally from Turin, Italy, came from her home in the Boston area to watch the final and said that when she bought a U.S. Open cap, she went with a fuchsia-hued one so it wouldn\u2019t be mistaken for the signature darker color of MAGA hats.",
      "\u201cI was careful not to get the red one,\u201d said the fan, who declined to give her name because of her employer's rules about being publicly quoted.",
      "Among those attending with Trump were White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Trump spent various portions of the match engaged in conversation with many of those around him.",
      "Elsewhere in the crowd were a slew of celebrities \u2014 some of whom publicly backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year's election. Among them were Pink, Bruce Springsteen and Shonda Rhimes. In pre-match interviews shown on large stadium screens with the likes of Martha Stewart and Jon Hamm, the questions asked stuck to tennis and pop culture \u2014 not Trump and politics.",
      "The president nonetheless was excited enough about his trip to tell reporters on Air Force One during the flight to New York when the plane flew over Ashe stadium \u2014 though the covered roof kept those inside from reacting.",
      "Trump was once a U.S. Open mainstay, but hadn't attended since he was booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign.",
      "The Trump Organization once controlled its own U.S. Open suite, which was adjacent to the stadium's television broadcasting booth, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Trump\u2019s first term. The family business is now being run by Trump\u2019s sons with their father back in the White House.",
      "Trump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Attending the tournament before he was a politician, he usually sat in his company's suite\u2019s balcony during night matches and was frequently shown on the arena\u2019s video screens.",

      "A Black man in South Carolina is pushing for the state to pass its own hate crime law after police say he was shot at by a white man in a racist attack",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- When Jarvis McKenzie locked eyes with the man in the car, he couldn't understand the hate he saw. When the man picked up a rifle, fired over his head and yelled \u201cyou better get running, boy!\u201d as he scrambled behind a brick wall, McKenzie knew it was because he is Black.",
      "McKenzie told his story a month after the shooting because South Carolina is one of two states along with Wyoming that don't have their own hate crime laws.",
      "About two dozen local governments in South Carolina have passed their own hate crime ordinances as the latest attempt to put pressure on the South Carolina Senate to take a vote on a bill proposing stiffer penalties for crimes driven by hatred of the victims because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender or ethnicity.",
      "A decade of pressure from businesses, the survivors of a racist Charleston church massacre that left nine dead, and a few of their own Republicans hasn't been enough to sway senators.",
      "Richland County, where McKenzie lives, has a hate crime ordinance and the white man seen on security camera footage grabbing the rifle and firing through his open car window before driving into his neighborhood on July 24 is the first to face the charge.",
      "But local laws are restricted to misdemeanors with sentences capped at a month in jail. The state hate crimes proposal backed by business leaders could add years on to convictions for assault and other violent crimes.",
      "McKenzie sat in the same spot at the edge of his neighborhood for a year at 5:30 a.m. waiting for his supervisor to pick him up for work. For him and his family, every trip outside now is met with uneasiness if not fear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to know that I get up every morning. I stand there not knowing if he had seen me before,\u201d McKenzie said.",
      "The lack of a statewide hate crime law rapidly became a sore spot in South Carolina after the 2015 shooting deaths of nine Black worshippers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. After a summer of racial strife in 2020, business leaders made it a priority and the South Carolina House passed its version in 2021.",
      "But in 2021 and again in the next session in 2023, the proposal stalled in the South Carolina Senate without a vote. Supporters say Republican Senate leadership knows it will pass as more moderate members of their own party support it but they keep it buried on the calendar with procedural moves.",
      "The opposition is done mostly in silence and the bill gets only mentioned in passing as the Senate takes up other items, like in May 2023 when a debate on guidelines for history curriculum on subjects like slavery and segregation briefly had a longtime Democratic lawmaker ask Republican Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey why hate crimes couldn't get a vote.",
      "\u201cThe problem right now is there is a number of people who think that not only is it feel good legislation, but it is bad legislation. It is bad policy not because people support hate but because it furthers division,\u201d Massey responded on the Senate floor.",
      "Opponents of a state hate crimes law point out there is a federal hate crimes law and the Charleston church shooter is on federal death row because of it.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense. We\u2019re making something very simple complicated, and it\u2019s not complicated. If you commit a crime against somebody just because of the hate for them, because of who they are, the religion, etcetera, we know what that is,\u201d Lott said.",
      "Democrats in the Senate were especially frustrated in this year's session because while senators debated harsher sentences for attacking health care workers or police dogs, hate crimes again got nowhere.",
      "Supporters of a state hate-crime law say South Carolina's resistance to enact one emboldens white supremacists.",
      "\"The subliminal message that says if you\u2019re racist and you want to commit a crime and target somebody for their race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or whatever it is you can do it here,\u201d said McKenzie's attorney, Tyler Bailey.",
      "Republican Gov. Henry McMaster understands why local governments are passing their own hate crime laws, but he said South Carolina's laws against assaults and other violent crimes have harsh enough sentences that judges can give maximum punishments if they think the main motivation of a crime is hate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a love crime. There is always an element of hatred or disrespect or something like that,\u201d said the former prosecutor who added he fears the danger that happens when investigators try to enter someone's mind or police their speech.",
      "But some crimes scream to give people more support in our society, Lott said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we protect everybody. My race, your race, everybody\u2019s race, your religion, there needs to be some protection for that. That\u2019s what our Constitution gives us,\u201d the sheriff said.",
      "And while the man charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature for shooting at McKenzie faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, the man who was just waiting to go to work feels like the state where he lives doesn't care about the terror he felt just because of his race.",
      "\u201cI feel like somebody is watching me. I feel like I'm being followed,\u201d McKenzie said. \"It spooked me.\u201d",

Such cuts can give a kickstart to the economy and job market, but the Fed has held off on them so far this year because they can also give inflation more fuel.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Justice Department prosecutors are dropping their federal case against a woman who was charged with threatening to kill President Donald Trump \u2014 the latest in a string of self-inflicted setbacks for prosecutors during President Donald Trump's law-enforcement surge in the nation's capital.",
      "A grand jury refused to indict Nathalie Rose Jones before U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro\u2019s office asked a judge on Friday to dismiss her case in district court. A one-page court filing by Pirro\u2019s office says dismissing the case against Jones \u201cis in the interests of justice,\u201d but it doesn't elaborate.",
      "Jones was due back in court Monday for a preliminary hearing. Her attorney, Mary Petras, asked the court to dismiss the case \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d which would prevent prosecutors from reviving the case.",
      "\u201cGiven the grand jury\u2019s decision, Ms. Jones should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest,\u201d Petras wrote.",
      "Petras said a prosecutor notified her Friday that \u201cno additional presentations were made to the grand jury.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe charges against Ms. Jones were based on interpretations of statements the government presented to the grand jury,\" she wrote. \"The grand jury rejected that interpretation of the statements and apparently agreed that Ms. Jones\u2019s statements were consistent with her First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to balk at returning an indictment, but it has happened at least seven times in five cases since Trump's surge started nearly a month ago.",

      "In the days and weeks following the death of his 9-year-old daughter, Lila, at Camp Mystic in the Texas Hill Country, Blake Bonner found himself wondering whether the tragedy was simply an unstoppable act of God or something could have been done to prevent it.",
      "Lila was one of 27 Camp Mystic campers and counselors swept to their deaths when fast-rising floodwaters of the Guadalupe River roared through the girls\u2019 summer camp. All told, the destructive flooding in Texas on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people and washed away homes and vehicles.",
      "\u201cIt just became clear to me that this incident was 100% preventable,\u201d Bonner said, \u201cand for a lot of reasons, I was going to do everything in my power, and I was hoping the other parents would as well, to make sure that our girls' legacy wasn't in vain.\u201d",
      "Bonner and many other parents and family members of the girls who died at Camp Mystic were in the Texas House and Senate gallery this week during a special session to see lawmakers give final approval to a series of bills aimed at preventing similar tragedies. Many of them shared hugs, handshakes and tears after they passed.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott has scheduled a bill signing ceremony on Friday with legislative leaders and some of the Camp Mystic parents.",
      "The measures aim to improve the safety of children's camps by prohibiting cabins in dangerous parts of flood zones and requiring camp operators to develop detailed emergency plans, train workers and install and maintain emergency warning systems. One allocates $240 million from the state's rainy day fund for disaster relief, along with money for warning sirens and improved weather forecasting.",

      "Matthew Childress, whose 18-year-old daughter Chloe was one of two counselors killed, said the effort by the families to pursue legislation began with a bond that developed through shared grief. As they mourned together, sometimes attending other children's funerals, they grew closer.",

      "The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift, but escalating pressure on the South American country has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s quarter-century in politics",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift in the countries\u2019 relations, but escalating pressure on the South American nation has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's quarter-century in politics.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat, a former Florida senator, has depicted Venezuela as a vestige of the communist ideology in the Western Hemisphere. Rubio has consistently pushed for the ouster of its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, advocated for economic sanctions and even argued for American military intervention.",
      "\u201cI think that U.S. armed forces should only be used in cases of national security threats,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with Univision. \u201cI think there is a strong argument that can be made right now that Venezuela and Maduro\u2019s regime have become a threat to the region and to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Before joining the administration, Rubio had represented a more interventionist wing of the Republican Party that at times seemed at odds with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d ethos. While Trump has promised no more foreign wars, Rubio and other administration officials have warned of more operations against drug traffickers in Latin America, escalating pressure on an adversary Rubio has long sought to confront.",
      "\"The president has said he wants to wage war on these groups because they\u2019ve been waging war on us for 30 years and no one has responded,\u201d Rubio told reporters Thursday.",
      "Before being tapped as secretary of state and national security adviser, the Florida senator had already exerted influence over U.S. policy toward Latin America during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "For Rubio, his interest in targeting leftist Latin American leaders has been personal. His parents are Cuban immigrants who arrived in Miami in 1956, a few years before Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 communist revolution. He grew up in Miami, where many Cubans sought refuge after Castro's rise to power.",
      "His consistent criticism of communism has helped win him support from thousands of members of the Venezuelan diaspora who made Florida their new home to escape crime, economic deprivation and unrest under Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who took power in 1999 and began his self-described socialist revolution.",
      "While the U.S. has tried to move past its Cold War-era legacy of interfering and destabilizing governments in Latin America, Rubio frequently advocated for more action, going against Ch\u00e1vez and then Maduro. He tied the struggle of the opposition movement there to that of Cuban exiles.",
      "Now, \u201che sees an opportunity to move forward a much more aggressive U.S. policy toward Latin America,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a senior analyst on Venezuela at the Atlantic Council in Washington.",
      "Rubio shared some of the first details about the strike Tuesday despite it being a military operation, posting on social media as Trump briefly announced it in the Oval Office. The White House says 11 people were killed.",
      "A day later, he said \u201cit\u2019ll happen again\u201d and said Trump had authority \u201cunder exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday while visiting Mexico.",
      "The Defense Department said late Thursday that two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel, calling it \u201ca highly provocative move\u201d and warning Maduro's government against further actions.",
      "The reaction within Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again base to the U.S. strike has been fairly muted, even supportive of it as a drug trafficking effort, unlike the divide that emerged over U.S. intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "After Trump bested Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and later took office in 2017, Rubio became a shadow adviser and was the main driver of sanctions against top-level Venezuelan officials for human rights abuses and ties to drug trafficking.",

      "Many believed Rubio was among the voices that urged Trump to back an opposition leader to unseat Maduro.",
      "In 2019, as Venezuelan forces were quelling unrest and an opposition leader urged other countries to intervene, Rubio posted a series of tweets showing before-and-after images of toppled leaders such as Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed by opposition fighters in 2011, and Panama\u2019s Manuel Noriega, who was ousted in a U.S. invasion in 1989.",

      "Grenell's side appears to take a more conciliatory approach, seen when the U.S. allowed oil producer Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela and in the coordination of prisoner exchanges and deportation flights with Maduro\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cI think the administration is internally divided about Venezuela,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who served as special representative for Venezuela under Trump\u2019s first term and said Grenell is advocating for a softer stance. \u201cI think Rubio is pushing for a hard line against Maduro, and he wins some, and he loses some.\u201d",

She\u2019s accused of fatally shooting agent David Maland in Vermont on Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the moratorium on federal executions.",
      "Youngblut initially was charged with using a deadly weapon against law enforcement and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon, crimes that were not punishable by the death penalty. But the Trump administration signaled early on that more serious charges were coming as part of its push for more federal executions, and a new indictment released last month charged her with murder of a federal law enforcement agent, assaulting other agents with a deadly weapon and related firearms offenses.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of protesters marched across Washington, D.C., on Saturday in one of the largest demonstrations against President Donald Trump's federal takeover of policing in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Behind a bright red banner reading \u201cEND THE D.C. OCCUPATION\u201d in English and Spanish, protesters marched over two miles from Meridian Hill Park to Freedom Plaza near the White House to rail against the fourth week of National Guard troops and federal agents patrolling D.C.\u2019s streets.",
      "The \u201cWe Are All D.C.\u201d protest \u2014 put together by local advocates of Home Rule and the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 was perhaps the most organized demonstration yet against Trump's federal intervention in Washington. The president justified the action last month as a way to address crime and homelessness in the city, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "Trump targeted D.C. after deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier this summer as the administration ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts and attempted to quell protests. The White House then turned to Washington, which presented a unique opportunity for Trump to push his tough-on-crime agenda because of its subservient status to the federal government.",

      "\u201cFederal agents, national guards patrolling our streets, that\u2019s really an affront to the democracy of our city,\" he said, adding that it\u2019s worse for D.C. residents due to their lack of federal representation. \"We don\u2019t have our own senators or members of the House of Representatives, so we\u2019re at the mercy of a dictator like this, a wanna-be dictator.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- Ruth Paine, whose kindness to Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife as a young mother near Dallas would leave her inexorably linked to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, has died. She was 92.",
      "Paine died on Sunday in a senior living facility in Santa Rosa, California, her daughter Tamarin Laurel-Paine said Thursday.",
      "Oswald's wife and children had been staying at Paine's home in the Dallas of suburb of Irving in the fall of 1963. Oswald stayed at the house the night before the assassination, and before setting off to his job at the Texas School Book Depository, retrieved his rifle that he had stowed in the garage \u2014 unbeknownst to Paine.",
      "Laurel-Paine said she admired her mother's willingness over the years to grant interviews and speak out. \u201cShe had adopted the notion that she was just there to be witness to what she knew of history and she would do it for any serious inquiry,\" Laurel-Paine said.",
      "Thomas Mallon, author of the book \u201cMrs. Paine\u2019s Garage,\" said Paine \u201cwas determined to tell the truth of her experience.\u201d",
      "\"She really put up with a lot of preposterous notions that people had, people who were determined to in some ways implicate her in what had gone on and I think she braved this very, very well, very politely always and I think that that took real strength of character,\u201d Mallon said.",
      "Kennedy was killed on Nov. 22, 1963, as shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building as his motorcade was ending its parade route. Police arrested Oswald, who worked in the building and was believed to have positioned himself from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor.",
      "That fall, Oswald's Russian-born wife Marina Oswald and her two children had been staying with Paine, a 31-year-old mother of two who was amicably separated from her husband.",

      "Lee Harvey Oswald, who was living in a rooming house near downtown, would usually visit his family at Paine\u2019s house on the weekends. But on the day before the assassination, he made an unexpected mid-week visit to Paine's home, where he'd tried unsuccessfully to reconcile with his wife after a fight a few days earlier.",

      "The clothes designed by Giorgio Armani (July 11, 1934-Sept. 4, 2025) very much reflected relaxed elegance \u2013 a supercool attitude that blurred divisions between men's and women's clothing. Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.",
      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",
      "Born in Piacenza, Italy, Armani's was a childhood ravaged by World War II, his family's home destroyed by bombs. Though he hadn't dreamed of a career in design, a temporary job in a department store made him realize he had a knack. Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.",
      "In 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman who became his partner in work and in life. Galeotti encouraged Armani to begin designing on his own.",
      "Armani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s. His liningless sports jacket, paired with a T-shirt, was an instant success, while his women's pantsuit was revolutionary. He landed on the cover of Time magazine, and his clothes found their way into countless films (including \"American Gigolo\"), and on the red carpet.",
      "After the death of Galeotti in 1985, Armani continued the company, building it into a $10 billion empire encompassing not just fashion but also home design, bars and restaurants, perfumes, cosmetics, and even a basketball team, Olympia Milano.",
      "A perfectionist, Armani would worry about every detail, no matter how small. When asked what he felt when releasing a new collecgtion, Armani replied, \"I am terrified.\""

    "summary": "Nate Bargatze, the highest-grossing stand-up in the U.S., talks about moving back to Nashville, the appeal of being a \"clean comic,\" and hosting the 77th Emmy Awards on CBS.",
    "story": [
      "2024 was a historic year for comedian Nate Bargatze. As the highest-grossing stand-up in the country, he set attendance records at several massive arenas. But a small gymnasium in Nashville \u2013 the home of the Donelson Christian Academy Wildcats \u2013 is where he's recently made his mark. He's donated more than a million dollars to his alma matter, which now features the Nate Bargatze Gymnasium.",
      "Bargatze never played on this court: \"Yeah, I was cut every year from my basketball team,\" he said. \"But now, you know, now they can't cut you!\"",
      "Donelson Christian Academy is a private high school his family could only afford because his father taught here. \"My freshman year, he's assistant coach,\" Bargatze said. \"So that really got it started. When your dad cuts you, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of your high school.\"",
      "Nate's father, Stephen Bargatze, also happens to be a professional magician. Before that, he was a clown. As you might imagine, that provided some inspiration for a career in comedy \u2013 and for some early stand-up material:",
      "\"It's funny, too, when I tell people my dad was a clown. People will just be like 'Ugh, I hate clowns.' Hey, remember that time I just said my dad was a clown?\"",
      "After dropping out of community college, Bargatze moved from Nashville to Chicago, where he honed his style performing for free at small clubs. \"I would never trade it, and I would never go back,\" he said. \"You just didn't know no better. There's nothing better than when you don't know that there's better.\"",
      "He then made the move to New York. But in 2014, just as his stand-up career was taking off, Bargatze made a surprising move back home to Nashville.",
      "Why? \"You know what? I always thought it was the first thing I did that wasn't for me,\" he said. \"I wanted my daughter to grow up in a normal situation, as normal as it can be. And so it was like, 'All right, let's move back.' And when I moved back, I just didn't tell anybody.\"",
      "I asked, \"Were you worried that there was going to be an impression that, like, 'Well, he moved back to Nashville, he's given up'?\"",
      "\"That's why I didn't tell anybody, 'cause I thought they would think I'd quit,\" Bargatze said. \"And I was so scared of that. So, I just didn't say anything.\"",
      "Nobody would ever think that now. Bargatze has since released five hour-long specials, written a New York Times bestselling book, and sold more than a million tickets last year alone.",
      "\"I don't know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. I watched 'Pearl Harbor,' I was as surprised as they were.\"",
      "His next milestone? Hosting the Primetime Emmy Awards next Sunday on CBS.",
      "\"I love show business,\" he said while recording promotional material for the awards. \"I love all of this. And as part of me, I want to do everything. You're just curious to go, like, Well, what is that like? What is that, you know, when you do 'Saturday Night Live'?\u00a0It's like, I want to see the chaos. I want to feel the chaos.\"",
      "Bargatze has hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" twice. [\"I'm as shocked as you are that I'm here,\" he said in his monologue.] His \"Washington's Dream\" sketch became one of the most viral sketches in years:",
      "There's more acting on the horizon. Bargatze just finished filming his first feature, \"The Breadwinner,\" costarring Mandy Moore, set to hit theaters next spring. His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own. Golf is, uh, you're so much like thinking about what you're doing out there. I realized, like, I can't turn my brain off, so I just need to direct it to something else.\"",
      "Bargatze has a lot to focus on. The day before he hosts the Emmys in Los Angeles, he's performing two back-to-back arena shows in Denver. But he wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "He said, \"I know how to kind of operate in this chaos. And if you pulled me out and gave me a month off, I think I would be like lost right now. Let's keep going. We're in a good groove. You don't want to kind of stop the groove. Yeah, it'll be a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff!\"",

      "At the age of 17, Debbie Gibson climbed to the top of the charts in 1988 with her hit song \"Foolish Beat,\" making her the youngest person ever to write, produce and perform a Billboard Hot 100 chart topper.",
      "Gibson still holds that record for female artists today.",
      "She wrote about the highs and lows of her decades-long career in her new memoir, \"Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music,\" crediting her late mother, Diane, for helping her succeed in the industry.",
      "\"We definitely would not be here celebrating this music today had it not been for her,\" Gibson told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "She explained her mother, who served as her \"momager,\" got a $10,000 loan and created a home studio.",
      "\"It was the garage turned laundry room, turned play room, turned studio,\" Gibson said. \"Occasionally, somebody needed to do a load of laundry and I had to stop singing, but other than that, I demoed all of my hits in that little studio. It was fun.\"",
      "Gibson said she thinks her mother is also responsible for helping young female artists of today.",
      "\"I think artists know their audience, but back then, it was the male power play and it was those men kind of dictating what young girls wore and who wrote their songs and \u2026 my mom went into those conference rooms and I remember vividly her pounding her fists on that table \u2026 fighting, saying my daughter can produce,\" she said.",
      "Gibson on honing her creative outlet and pivoting",
      "In her memoir, Gibson talks about writing a song as a teenager every single day.",
      "\"I like to say kids write in diaries or like as adults we have an inner monologue. Mine always came with a melody attached. I'm always singing my thoughts,\" she said.",
      "In her career, Gibson has had 11 Top 40 singles and sold more than 16 million albums worldwide. For Gibson, it was her creative outlet that her parents encouraged.",
      "\"They were always like, 'What did you write today? Let us hear it.' It was always just like a really joyful thing to create a song,\" she recalled. \"I always felt like I had a secret, like I'm about to play you something you have never heard and I still think that is the coolest thing in the world.\"",
      "When she first went to Atlantic Records at 16 years old, she already had 100 songs written.",
      "\"They really let me do my thing, especially in the beginning,\" Gibson said.",
      "\"I write about as time went on everybody kind of wanted to get their hands on strategizing and \u2026 they were trying to force that sensual sexual transition into womanhood a little early for my natural transformation.\"",
      "She said she would eventually walk away and started recording independently.",
      "\"This last era for me, like the last five years since I went out with New Kids On The Block on the Mixtape Tour, that independent spirit of mine now because we have such a connection through social media to our audiences, it's like the time in my life in my creativity that I'm thriving more than ever.\"",
      "Gibson in the memoir calls herself \"the queen of the pivot.\"",
      "For those looking to make a change, she said, \"embrace that it's OK that changes are happening and understand that there might be some \u2014 there might be me some gift in that pivot.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

      "The game ended at 12:18 a.m.",
      "It was delayed 65 minutes because of lightning in the area. The Eagles led 24-20 with 4:44 left in the third quarter when the gamn was stopped - and that's the way it ended.",
      "Hurts wore out a defense without Micah Parsons on TD runs of 4 and 8 yards - no legal tush push needed. Saquon Barkley also ran for a 10-yard score, even if his final rushing total of 60 yards was minuscule compared to the last season, when he topped 2,000 yards.",
      "Hurts punctuated one score by chucking the ball into the stands and shrugging his shoulders much like his friend and mentor, Michael Jordan, who received a nice ovation when he was shown on the big screen.",
      "\"I think our discipline wasn't in it early in the game,\" Hurts said. \"Great job by our defense being able to battle and respond. Guys stepped in and filled those roles. We came into this game talking about discipline and focus, and we'll leave it saying the same things.\"",
      "Hurts, Barkley and the rest of the Eagles spent a pregame ceremony where the team raised their 2024 championship banner inside the locker room, per the wishes of coach Nick Sirianni.",
      "\"It's a new team. It's a new journey. We got tested tonight,\" Hurts said. \"We know how they are when Dak is back and they've got their crew all together. We've played better football, but it's always good to say that and find a way to win.\"",

    "summary": "Four physicians, who recently resigned from the CDC in protest, tell \"Sunday Morning\" they believe HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is jeopardizing the nation's public health.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On August 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",

      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "Senior CDC officials resign after Monarez ouster, cite concerns over scientific independenceOver 1,000 HHS staffers call on Trump to fire RFK Jr. for \"endangering the nation's health\"",
      "Senior CDC officials resign after Monarez ouster, cite concerns over scientific independence",
      "Over 1,000 HHS staffers call on Trump to fire RFK Jr. for \"endangering the nation's health\"",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2013 not skeptics \u2013 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2013 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2013 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2013 now featuring Kennedy appointees \u2013 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

      "The Universal Postal Union says it has started rolling out new measures that can help postal operators around the world calculate and collect duties, or taxes, after the U.S. eliminated the so-called \"de minimis exemption\" for lower-value parcels.",
      "Eighty-eight postal operators have told the UPU that they have suspended some or all postal services to the United States until a solution is implemented with regard to U.S.-bound parcels valued at $800 or less, which had been the cutoff for imported goods to escape customs charges.",
      "\"The global network saw postal traffic to the U.S. come to a near-halt after the implementation of the new rules on Aug. 29, 2025, which for the first time placed the burden of customs duty collection and remittance on transportation carriers or U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency-approved qualified parties,\" the UPU said in a statement.",
      "The UPU said information exchanged between postal operators through its electronic network showed traffic from its 192 member countries \u2014 nearly all the world's countries \u2014 had fallen 81% on Aug. 29, compared to a week earlier.",
      "The Bern, Switzerland-based agency said the \"major operational disruptions\" have occurred because airlines and other carriers indicated they weren't willing or able to collect such duties, and foreign postal operators had not established a link to CBP-qualified companies.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has skyrocketed over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to about 1.4 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was processing more than 4 million \"de minimis\" shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.",
      "Before the measure took effect, the postal union sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to express concerns about its impact.",
      "The de minimis provision was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law was passed. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs now require vetting and are subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%.",
      "While the change applies to the products of every country, U.S. residents will not have to pay duties on incoming gifts valued at up to $100, or on up to $200 worth of personal souvenirs from trips abroad, according to the White House.",
      "The UPU said its members had not been given enough time or guidance to comply with the procedures outlined in the executive order President Trump signed on July 30 to eliminate the duty-free eligibility of low-value goods.",

    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",
      "The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county's Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-today-august-2025-three-takeways-federal-reserve/",
    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:35:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Employers added far fewer jobs last month than economists had predicted, prompting some experts to reassess the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Many economists say Friday's disappointing jobs report\u00a0is sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. and the broader health of the economy.",
      "Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, far short of Wall Street analyst forecasts of 80,000, while the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% \u2014 the highest level since October of 2021, when the economy was still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. In 2024, the economy added an average of 168,000 per month, labor data shows.",
      "The job market is faltering partly because of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty, boosting costs for importers and complicating business planning.. Some economists also think that rapid employer adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for recent college graduates and other entry-level workers, although there is ongoing debate among researchers about how much AI is affecting job growth.",
      "\"Uncertainty makes it very, very difficult for people in companies to make decisions,\" Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job-search firm Indeed and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"My former boss says that when you are driving through fog, you slow down \u2014 but if it gets thick enough, you pull over.\"",
      "The Trump administration defended its trade and other economic policies, expressing confidence they will eventually drive growth.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",
      "Here are three key takeaways from economists about the latest employment figures.",
      "The job market is stalling",
      "Overall hiring in August was far weaker than economists expected. More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:55:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him, famously created luxury looks for Hollywood stars, while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic, which operates the Claude artificial intelligence app, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who alleged the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",

Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump hosted a dinner Thursday night at the White House with tech giants and other business and political leaders, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk was\u00a0not be among those attending.",
      "More than a dozen tech titans were invited to the event, including Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, OpenAI founder Sam Altman, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, according to the White House. The Hill first reported the list of invitees.",
      "Mr. Trump was seated next to Zuckerberg, while Gates sat next to first lady Melania Trump. The president \u2014 who has cultivated close ties with the CEOs of companies like Apple and Nvidia and sought investment pledges from some of them \u2014 hailed the business leaders, who he said were \"leading a revolution in business and in genius.\"",
      "\"This is definitely a high-IQ group, and I'm very proud of them,\" the president said.",
      "Mr. Trump invited several of the executives to speak, including Zuckerberg, Nadella and Pichai.",
      "Gates, whose charitable foundation focuses heavily on public health, used much of his speaking time to discuss advancements in vaccine technology \u2014 remarks that came hours after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, faced tense questions in a Senate hearing.",
      "Gates lauded Mr. Trump's Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine initiative and said that, while \"we don't need new science\" on polio vaccines, new research is needed for diseases like HIV and sickle sell anemia.",
      "When asked by reporters whether he has confidence in Kennedy, Mr. Trump called him a \"very good person\" who \"means very well\" and has a \"different take.\"",
      "\"It's not your standard talk, I would say,\" Mr. Trump said of Kennedy's views on vaccines and medicine. \"But if you look at what's going on in the world with health, and look at this country also with regard to health, I like the fact that he's different.\"",
      "Elon Musk says he was invited but couldn't attend",
      "Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014\u00a0said\u00a0on X, \"I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there.\" A White House official also confirmed Musk had been invited.",
      "Musk earlier this year had a public falling-out with Mr. Trump as he left the administration, blasting Mr. Trump and his administration over government spending and the Epstein files. He pledged to begin a new political party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" although that has yet to come to fruition.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump predicted that Musk would eventually return to the Republican Party.",
      "\"I don't think he has a choice,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview this week on \"The Scott Jennings Radio Show.\" \"So what's he going to do, he's gonna go with the radical left lunatics? They're lunatics. I don't think he has a choice. He's a man of common sense, he's a good man.\"",
      "The president said of Musk, \"He's a good man. He got off the reservation, incorrectly, and that's okay, because, you know, it's just one of those things.\" He also characterized the Tesla CEO as \"80% super genius, and then 20% he's got some problems,\" and added, \"and when he works out the 20%, he'll be great, but he's got some difficulty.\"",
      "Thursday's dinner was briefly open to press cameras before continuing behind closed doors. First lady Melania Trump hosted an AI summit earlier in the day, and some of the dinner attendees attended.",
      "Mr. Trump has pursued close relationships with tech CEOs, hosting a number of them for White House meetings and even giving them prime access at his\u00a0inauguration. A number of those CEOs donated to his\u00a0inauguration fund.",
      "Several tech leaders have paid visits to the White House in the past, with Cook using a White House event last month to\u00a0 unveil a\u00a0$100 billion commitment by Apple to manufacture in the U.S. Last month, the U.S. government also announced it was taking a 10% stake in Intel, days after a White House meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The move\u00a0drew criticism\u00a0from some conservatives and economists.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pressed tech companies to boost their U.S. presence,\u00a0threatening a roughly 100% tariff on imported semiconductors unless companies have agreed to start making chips in the U.S.",
      "Sara  Cook and \n                                                  \n                      Kristin  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "A federal jury has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million for improperly snooping on people's smartphones during a nearly decade-long period of intrusions.",
      "The verdict reached Wednesday in San Francisco federal court followed a more than two-week trial in a class-action case covering about 98 million smartphones operating in the United States between July 1, 2016, through Sept. 23, 2024. That means the total damages awarded in the five-year-old case works out to about $4 per device.",
      "Google had denied that it was improperly tracking the online activity of people who thought they had shielded themselves with privacy controls. The company maintained its stance even though the eight-person jury concluded Google had been spying in violation of California privacy laws.",
      "\"This decision misunderstands how our products work, and we will appeal it,\" Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said Thursday. \"Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalization, we honor that choice.\"",
      "The lawyers who filed the case had argued Google had used the data they collected off smartphones without users' permission to help sell ads tailored to users' individual interests \u2014 a strategy that resulted in the company reaping billions in additional revenue. The lawyers framed those ad sales as illegal profiteering that merited damages of more than $30 billion.",
      "Even though the jury came up with a far lower calculation for the damages, one of the lawyers who brought the case against Google hailed the outcome as a victory for privacy protection.",
      "\"We hope this result sends a message to the tech industry that Americans will not sit idly by as their information is collected and monetized against their will,\" said attorney John Yanchunis of law firm Morgan & Morgan.",
      "The San Francisco jury verdict came a day after Google avoided the U.S. Department of Justice's attempt to break up the company in a landmark antitrust case in Washington, D.C., targeting its dominant search engine. A federal judge who had declared Google's search engine to be an illegal monopoly ordered less radical changes, including requiring the company to share some of its search data with rivals.",

      "The list, which was first reported by Axios, isn't final, as it must still be published in the Federal Register. But the Treasury Department notes that the IRS expects the final list to \"be substantially the same as this preliminary list.\"",
      "The new tax rule could save qualifying tipped workers about $1,300 each, according to the White House. Some restrictions built into the law could limit the tax break's value, while some people in jobs on Treasury's list \u2014 but that don't typically receive tips \u2014 might not derive much benefit from the change.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes.

      "\"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in the company's statement.",

    "story": [
      "Frontier Airlines is offering its annual GoWild! unlimited travel pass for $299 for a short time before the price doubles to $599.",
      "The all-you-can-fly pass is available for the discounted price through Friday, the airline said Tuesday. It allows passengers to book unlimited flights \u2014 with some restrictions \u2014 for one penny plus taxes and fees.",
      "The 2026-2027 GoWild! pass is valid for 20 months and can be used immediately, marking the longest travel window since Frontier launched the program in 2022. Previously, the pass would have only been valid for trips beginning in May 2026, according to the airline.",
      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",
      "What do passholders get?",
      "GoWild! passholders can book flights on domestic flights one day before departure, and 10 days ahead of an international flight's departure date. This year, for an additional fee, they can book flights earlier.",
      "Flight reservations must be made at flyfrontier.com or on Frontier's mobile app.",
      "The passes are non-transferrable, and are valid through the end of April 2027.",
      "Are there any restrictions?",
      "Yes. Flights are subject to blackout periods, meaning passholders cannot book unlimited fights during what are typically busy times to travel.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",
      "As of Sept. 3, traders see a 95% probability that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

    "summary": "A new survey predicts Americans will spend $1,552 per person on average, 5% less than they did in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year.

      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",

      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report.

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said Sunday that President Trump \"essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation\" referring to his recent remarks about Chicago. But she outlined that \"we don't have any indications\" that the administration is getting ready to send troops into the nation's third-largest city, despite signals in recent weeks that he is preparing to do so.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Duckworth said of Mr. Trump's statements on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"This is not acceptable behavior.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that read \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" alongside an AI-generated image that appeared to be inspired by the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, though a formal name change would have to go through Congress. He is expected to seek congressional approval.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that \"we're not going to war.\"",
      "\"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend,\" the president said. \"That's not war, that's common sense.\"",
      "The post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago. The comments came one day after Mr. Trump again suggested he would send federal forces to Chicago, saying \"we're going in.\"",
      "Still, Duckworth said she takes what the president says seriously.",
      "\"I take what the president of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,\" Duckworth said. \"And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear: it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.\"",
      "Duckworth was among a group of Illinois leaders who visited the Naval Station Great Lakes Saturday, following news that some federal immigration enforcement agents will be based there. She said military leadership confirmed that the only assistance they've been requested to provide to the federal government is for office space for ICE.",
      "\"No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago,\" Duckworth said.",
      "The Illinois Democrat said \"we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing,\" adding that the administration hasn't reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate.",
      "\"If they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, 'What do you need? What help do you need?'\" Duckworth said. \"And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett, who President Trump has said is on his shortlist to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve, said Sunday that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy \"needs to be fully independent of political influence \u2014 including from President Trump.\"",
      "\"The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments came after Mr. Trump said Friday that Hassett is among three candidates he's considering to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term is up in 2026. Powell, has faced intense pressure from the president to cut interest rates, spurring questions about the White House's influence at the central bank.",
      "Hassett said central bank independence is something \"Democrats and Republicans in the White House all agree about.\"",
      "\"Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent as we would like, and I think that there's some dispute about that,\" Hasset added.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for changes to the Federal Reserve and a widespread review of the institution in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Friday, writing that \"mission creep and institutional bloat threaten the central bank's independence.\" Hassett said on Sunday that he agrees with Bessent's piece, but he wouldn't commit to implementing his ideas should he become the next Fed chair.",
      "\"I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the president deciding who's going to be the Federal Reserve Chair, and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably,\" Hassett said. \"There are a lot of great candidates.\"",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh are also on Mr. Trump's shortlist.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, as well as selecting a top economic aide as a replacement for another post on the board of governors, have sparked questions around independence at the Federal Reserve in recent weeks, raising concerns among Wall Street analysts that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank.",
      "Stephen Miran, Mr. Trump's pick to join a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, testified on Capitol Hill last week and sparked criticism from Democrats after he suggested he wouldn't immediately resign from his White House role if he was confirmed.",
      "Miran, who currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged at the hearing that Mr. Trump selected him \"because I have policy views that I suppose that he liked.\" But he pledged that if confirmed, he would \"act independently.\"",
      "\"I couldn't be more in agreement that independence of the central bank is of paramount importance for the economy, for financial markets, for the long-run stewardship of the country,\" Miran said.",
      "CBS News polling released Sunday found that 68% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from Mr. Trump. But 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what the president wants.",
      "The developments come as U.S. employers added 22,000 jobs in August, according to the August jobs report released Friday, falling short of economists' expectations. Hiring was lower-than-expected in July as well, a pattern that complicates the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, set for Sept. 17.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Republican Senator Roger Marshall, who joins us this morning from Wichita, Kansas. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Margaret, great to be with you. I know it's going to be a great discussion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were an OB-GYN in practice for decades before you ran for office. This past week, the HHS Secretary underwent intense questioning from both democratic lawmakers, and some of your fellow Republicans, who were also doctors. Take a listen.",
      "((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO:\u00a0 Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccine.",
      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Republican Whip, and that is the Chair of the Committee, Bill Cassidy. Why do you think they're off base and they're concerned?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, President Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing. He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now, Americans don't trust the CDC, so he is literally turning that place upside down. I respect what my colleagues are saying, but I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there's many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I just want to unpack a few things you said there, and just very- because we want to be very careful in this very heated environment. When you say you have a problem with trusting the CDC, it was just a few weeks ago a gunman walked onto the CDC campus in Atlanta and shot the place up. Do you care to respond to that? And do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Well, look, of course, I condemn that shooting. But the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They misguided us, maybe lied to us, even, about the origins of Covid, and how to treat it, as well. And the vaccine, they over-promised what the vaccine could do as well. So that's where the distrust is. And now, Bobby Kennedy is in there, trying to clean-up that distrust, and trying to give American parents and grandparents and the doctors the right information, transparent information, to make good decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid, and what you just said with the CDC; it was- the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration, and Operation Warp Speed was a Presidential Directive by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the President deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay, but you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that. --",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I disagree. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago, we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China. But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it, and not everybody needs the vaccine. So both things can be true, and that's why, when you have people who don't understand science, that don't understand medicine, why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot. Because in many states, they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect, here, of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That- look, vaccines are a medicine, and just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. You said he's disrupting. But, effectively, what you were hearing the Republican Whip John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the interruption of the availability of vaccine. Cassidy said, I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines. That's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, I disagree, respectfully disagree. Think about this, what the CDC is now saying is if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the UK and France have set 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription, and you should be able to get it. If you're over the age of 6 months, it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and say, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So I think we're making this way too complicated. Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide. There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about: Chronic diseases, 20% of our adolescents have obesity, mental health problems in- and are on prescription drugs. There's so many more things to talk about than just Covid vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're changing a few things here. There are big implications, and I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine. You like DPT, Polio, Smallpox. You don't like Hepatitis B, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids need to be vaccinated against it. Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So why isn't it a compelling argument to you, that this should be available?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I delivered a baby- delivered a baby every day for 25 years. We did a Hepatitis test on every one of my patients at the time of delivery. If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have Hepatitis. Now, there's other moms that- or other babies that do need it, okay. We need to be more specific. We can't be overly-prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug-abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well? So, that's my concern. It's not every baby needs Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand it can also be spread from- in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example. But I hear your point here that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking-and-choosing. But others would argue, here, that in doing that, you're going to drive down immunization rates overall, if you create broader doubt in vaccines, and that it's a slippery slope, here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years, or eight years, however long he has Secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci. But this- but I'm just telling --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm asking you about what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy. I was talking about you, and what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and are you concerned that picking-and-choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one-size-fits-all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the- reads the book does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, and nurses, and parents, and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far. But how about just a little common sense? Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines. Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or Acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take- tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a Category-B drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved- approved list. But, that being said, I try to tell my patients- my pregnant woman, not to take anything, because we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why- why did 20% of our children have some type of mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases? We- so we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know, and I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out. But as far as I know, Tylenol is okay in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, we'll leave it there for today. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin this morning with the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good morning and thank you for being here.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Yes I agree with this article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical that we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Other ways to implement tariffs. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- But it might be like, yeah, too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday. But, but yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you, it's great to be here."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: A not-so-hot jobs report leads to more uncertainty about the strength of the economy. With Friday's jobs report showing an even foggier forecast for American consumers than anticipated, President Trump called on his chief economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, to explain.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Right now, we're puzzled about the BLS numbers and looking for new leadership there to make it so that the numbers are more reliable.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can those independent agencies, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve, maintain their independence in light of political pressure? We will ask Kevin Hassett and get his take on the state of the economy.",
      "Plus, as the circle of critics grows when it comes to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handling of vaccines and management of the CDC, we will talk to Republican Senator Roger Marshall. And the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, will also join us to weigh in on the news of the week.",
      "Finally, as President Trump moves to rebrand the Defense Department as the Department of War and continues to warn the city of Chicago he will soon send in federal forces, we will talk to Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin this morning with the director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "Good morning, and thank you for being here\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 in person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight.",
      "Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and \u2013 in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisers of the president, but at the National Economic Council, we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as, for example, India has been doing by \u2013 excuse me \u2013 by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically.",
      "And, you know, last night's news is very disappointing, and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Perhaps, yes. I mean, it's up to the president in the end, but, yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down.",
      "You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled, and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well \u2013 well, first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in '23 and '24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs.",
      "There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say, do you \u2013 do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created 4.5 million jobs and the household survey said about two million fewer, about 2.5 million jobs. And they should have the same answer.",
      "And so, for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old-fashioned ways of surveying \u2013 like, I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in. Maybe you have.",
      "But I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second- quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3 percent. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3 percent. And so industrial production is at an all-time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so \u2013 no, the point is, when there's dissonance in data, that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now in terms of data quality is the job number, in part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 15.",
      "But, again, even think about this. If we ask households how many jobs do they have, it's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's \u2013 that becomes a puzzle for economists. Like, what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is, people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias, not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you fix the political bias or\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013 there \u2013 there \u2013 there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them.",
      "But think about this. At the Federal Reserve\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't trust these numbers from Friday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized.",
      "And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, trend line-wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble that their costs are going up due to tariffs, that doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right, when a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity \u2013 or profitability, I should say.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, we've seen inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high 3's when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1. 9.",
      "And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets, because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Expected\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so the Fed \u2013 they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yes, there are \u2013 there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half-a-million this year, and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000.",
      "There's another thing, is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native-born workers, and they've actually \u2013 there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native-born workers. And the other\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a \u2013 we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There \u2013 there's technicalities that \u2013 when someone's released into the country, then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going after the employers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 who were being able to work.",
      "But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by, like, county, that about 80 percent of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities, and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern you're talking about of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but \u2013 but I do see the pattern of native-born versus non-native-born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data you say you don't trust necessarily that it's manufacturing that's trade-related, that that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the president had promised there would be new jobs.",
      "When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now, that industrial production is at an all-time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8 percent in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down.",
      "And so how is it that industrial production is at an all-time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been last \u2013 last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week.",
      "Last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created.",
      "I want to ask you about the Fed, because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world, because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.",
      "Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70 percent of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here; 59 percent of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants, 41 percent should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey, then I would say 100 percent that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy needs to be fully independent of political influence and\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump.",
      "The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so Central Bank independence is something that \u2013 as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about.",
      "Now, the question is, has the current Central Bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this past week.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: He did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He talked about the Central Bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research.",
      "What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have to have been thinking about it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Look, I have been the president's \u2013 one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but, right now, what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, I agree with his article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical, that \u2013 we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems, from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Oh, I \u2013 I agree \u2013 I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the president deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair. And I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the president's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEEPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We \u2013 we certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that. And I think that we're on pretty high ground. And so it's a very unlikely scenario.",
      "But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know, numbers that we could go into if you like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other ways to implement tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But it might be like, yes, too \u2013 too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But \u2013 but, yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person.",
      "You are known for your Intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that, basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world.",
      "Could there be reforms? Absolutely. But it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data.",
      "And the president had promised that \u2013 a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're at basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college, you know what a tough job market is to find this.",
      "And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin and, frankly, from more economists is, we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of A.I. job dislocation. And those are many times kind of a \u2013 college-driven jobs.",
      "I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated.",
      "And so I just \u2013 I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score, when I think the American public realize the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy if you're talking about artificial intelligence.",
      "So, on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space, Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing and A.I.",
      "Do you deserve \u2013 do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I can tell you, the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden, the CHIPS infrastructure act\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 with the $52 billion, totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning \u2013 meaningful fabricator of chips.",
      "He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10 percent of the company now.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes.",
      "But the \u2013 here's the weird thing. While he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H20 chips to sell to China. So, what - - how do we read this? If we want to say we want to build American capacity, Intel, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China, well, why sell some of our most cutting-edge chips to China?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It is a complete contradiction in \u2013 in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, oh, they're not great chips, so, therefore we can \u2013 can sell them. That's what the commerce secretary has said.",
      "But on \u2013 on the Intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight.",
      "But, this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I have either been chair or vice chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the work force where they're working. You get to see the new \u2013 newest, best, coolest stuff.",
      "And, oftentimes, I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the chair or vice chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: So, this \u2013 this meeting had been on the books for literally weeks, normal course of business.",
      "This very unusual individual Laura Loomer, who is a right-wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in \u2013 in their Cabinet or \u2013 and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti \u2013 anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists.",
      "Yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump. So, his first national security adviser\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to Cabinet members, including the secretary of state.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, his first national security adviser got kicked out because she went after him. The head of the National Security Agency, who I saw with \u2013 recently, General Tim Haugh, got fired. She claimed that firing.",
      "Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their \u2013 their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the acting secretary of defense or secretary of war as of this morning?",
      "Is she the real director of national intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, why can we let some anti- Trump person in to an intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, we're not going to stand up for that. I have talked to my Republican colleagues. I think you will\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I have raised it with the other Intelligence members.",
      "You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress' ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space, in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers. We are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight.",
      "They try to restrict this, America will be less safe. And we're going to \u2013 I'm going to get those meetings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign, it would seem, in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat.",
      "Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says \u2013 quote \u2013 \"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States.\" He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline.",
      "Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl.",
      "We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD \u2013 it was not an intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats \u2013 there's supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully.",
      "My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures were followed. And I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is, if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and \u2013 and hurt those sailors? The sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as far as you know, this is fully a military operation; it is not using the intelligence assets of the intelligence\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, we have not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat. They had great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I would like to see that data.",
      "But this, again, goes to the point this kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that are supposed to get the absolute secret stuff that only the president gets. I have gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information-sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: There are information-sharing. The level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing, we\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: For example, we were \u2013 on the Iran bombings, we were not notified beforehand. My Republican colleagues were notified.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: This kind of cooking the books and intelligence, how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Norah O'Donnell spoke recently with Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett for CBS Sunday Morning.",
      "Coney's new book is \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution.\"",
      "Here's part of their conversation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NORAH O'DONNELL: This court has issued stays or limited injunctions in cases regarding birthright citizenship, foreign aid funding freezes, federal work force reduction.",
      "Will you \u2013 can you answer that question? Do these repeated emergency or shadow docket interventions by the Supreme Court risk undermining public trust, especially if they are perceived to be politically motivated and favorable to President Trump?",
      "AMY CONEY BARRETT (U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice): Well, I think that the point of the book is that justices and judges, I want to include all federal judges in this, are deciding things on the merits.",
      "And I think that, to the extent that any decision makes us unpopular, that's part of the price of the job. We have to make our best judgment about what the law requires. And, sometimes, that might mean that the executive branch succeeds in litigation and sometimes not.",
      "But it's not our job to look across the docket and say, oh, we want to even things out so that sometimes the executive branch wins some, sometimes it loses some. That's the antithesis of what our job entails. Our job entails making legal judgments about the cases that come before us. And we really can't \u2013 I mean, we want the court and I want the \u2013 I want the public to have trust in the integrity of the court.",
      "But the court can never change its decisions, its judgments about what the best \u2013 what the right outcome is in order to tailor it to public opinion. The court's supposed to render unpopular decisions sometimes, because, sometimes, the right legal answer isn't necessarily the popular one.",

      "We turn now to Republican Senator Roger Marshall, who joins us this morning from Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "So \u2013",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL (R-KS): Margaret, great to with you. I know it's going to be a great discussion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I know you were an OB/GYN in practice for, you know, decades before you ran for office. This past week the HHS secretary underwent intense questioning from both Democratic lawmakers and some of your fellow Republicans who were also doctors.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned.",
      "SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): I would say effectively we're denying people vaccine.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean that's \u2013 that's the Republican whip and that is the chair of the committee, Bill Cassidy. Why do you think they're off base in their concern?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, President Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a disruptor to the CDC. And that's exactly what he's doing. He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now Americans don't trust the CDC. So, he is literally turning that place upside down.",
      "I respect what my colleagues are saying. But I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there is many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines overall have saved hundreds of millions of lives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I just want to unpack a few things you said there and just very \u2013 because we want to be very careful in this very heated environment.",
      "When you say you have a problem with trusting the CDC, it was just a few weeks ago a gunman walked on to the CDC campus in Atlanta and shot the place up.",
      "Do you care to respond to that, and do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Well, look, of course I condemn that shooting. But the \u2013 the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They \u2013 they misguided us, maybe lied to us even, about the origins of Covid and how to treat it as well. And the vaccine, they \u2013 they overpromised what the vaccine could do as well. So, that's where the distrust is.",
      "And now Bobby Kennedy is in there trying to clean up that distrust and trying to give American parents, and grandparents and the doctors the right information, transparent information, to make good decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. But just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid and what you just said. With the CDC it was \u2013 the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration. And Operation Warp Speed was a presidential directive by \u2013 by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the president deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes, look, President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel Prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives. But this is such a different time. That's what my friends \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I disagree with you. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China.",
      "But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it. And not everybody needs the vaccine. So, both things can be true. And that's why when you have people that don't understand science, that don't understand medicine \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. But people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot, because in many states they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect here of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That, look, vaccines are a medicine. And just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but what you said, he's disrupting. Right, you said he's disrupting, but effectively what you were hearing the Republican whip, John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the \u2013 the interruption of the availability of vaccines. Cassidy said, \"I would say effectively we're denying people vaccines.\" So, that's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. Look, I disagree. Respectfully disagree. Think about this. What the CDC is now saying is, if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the U.K. and France have said 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription and you should be able to get it.",
      "If you're over the age of six months, you probably \u2013 it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and says, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So, I think we're making this way too complicated.",
      "Why does everybody lose their minds whether it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide. Let the patients decide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Chronic diseases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Twenty percent of our adolescents have obesity, mental health problems and \u2013 and \u2013 and are under prescription drugs. There's so many more things to talk about than just Covid vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're \u2013 we're changing a few things here. There are big implications. And I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine, you like DPT, polio, smallpox. You don't like hepatitis b, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids me to be vaccinated against it.",
      "Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So, why isn't it a compelling argument to you that this should be available?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. So, I delivered a baby \u2013 I delivered a baby every day for \u2013 for 25 years. We did a hepatitis test on every one of my patients. At the time of delivery, if that mom has a negative hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby going to play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have hepatitis.",
      "Now, there's other moms that \u2013 or other babies that do need it, OK? We need to be more specific. We can't be overly prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick and choose. Not every baby needs the hepatitis vaccine. And especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to \u2013 to \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: To mess with the immune system of \u2013 of that particular baby as well?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: So, that's my concern. So not every baby needs hepatitis b vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And I understand it can also be spread from \u2013 in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example.",
      "But \u2013 but I hear your point here, that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking and choosing. But others would argue here that \u2013 that in doing that you are going to drive down immunization rates overall if you create broader doubt in vaccines. And that it's a slippery slope here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years or eight years, however long he is the secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci.",
      "But this \u2013 but I'm just telling you, parents today want more information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking you about what you said about the hepatitis b vaccine.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy, I was talking about you and what you said about the hepatitis b vaccine and are you concerned that picking and choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes, I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one size fits all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the \u2013 reads the book, does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, in nurses and parents and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But how about just a little common sense. Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. Because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines.",
      "Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take \u2013 tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a category b drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved \u2013 approved list.",
      "But that being said, I try to tell my patients not \u2013 my pregnant women not to take anything because, you know, we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Why do 20 percent of our children have some type of a mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I \u2013 we \u2013 so, we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know. And I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. We'll leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you attended, as I understand it, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\"",
      "Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication now that there are plans to do so?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Let's make it clear, the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior.",
      "No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they have been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that there are no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to \u2013 in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so then is this just, you know, social media trash- talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue-in-cheek?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War. And did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I \u2013 I don't \u2013 I take what the president of the United States says very seriously because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on major city, any city, within the United States by the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes naval training session \u2013 station, I should say, and you said, the military leadership said they'll only get office space. ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions. And the resources will not be diverted from military training. So, all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get their basic training, and then later on some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have there should be \u2013 that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to do their jobs. None of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of how Democrats are responding to this rhetoric, \"The Chicago Tribune\" faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats to, quote, \"not stand idly by if the Guard went in.\" They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they've not \u2013 they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator \u2013 Congressman Schneider sent a request into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes, and can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are, and they replied, no, you can't, and, in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they are \u2013 that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left.",
      "Now, the Navy allowed us on to the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up.",
      "And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiry about what they are planning on doing, who are they bringing into Chicago. Are they planning to bring the National Guard in. They've none \u2013 none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, in your armed services role, about what is a significance geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seemed to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The signal to the United States is \u2013 is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear. And it, you know, it doesn't escape me the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war in Chicago.",
      "This is what Donald Trump does. When something bad goes \u2013 happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be \u2013 allow him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. And our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the unemployment rate is still low. But I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number.",
      "Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says, \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat \u2013 alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: It was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There is a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order \u2013 in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just \u2013 we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: And it could be civilians. And they could say, you know what, those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: You know, he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto, for more insight on today's CBS News poll.",
      "So, Anthony, let's start on the economy. That jobs report for August was lower than expected. Inflation is down from its post-Covid peak, but it's still not at that 2 percent level the Fed wants to get to.",
      "How are people feeling?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Earlier this week I asked people, pick one word to describe the economy. And the top one they picked was \"uncertain.\" And you see here, I think tariffs are a big part of that. We've already seen four in ten people tell us they're cutting back on spending because of increases from prices that they see as part of tariffs. They think tariffs are going to raise prices in both the short term and the long term. And part of that is support for imposing new tariffs has been ticking down. It is now down again. Increasingly confined just to the president's base, to Republicans.",
      "Now, there is their view that it will ultimately increase manufacturing jobs in the U.S., that people ought to be willing to pay a little bit more to support President Trump's policies, but that view has not permeated beyond that base to the wider public, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we might need to wait until we see that job growth in those areas.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, I mean it could be, in some ways, that pull back a little bit of leading indicator as we go forward, right? People spending. The other part of this, too, is more broadly. And we talk about who and where you can impose tariffs. When we talk about influence on the Federal Reserve, a presidential influence there, the lens of this is also about presidential power and how much influence a president can have over those levers on the economy.",
      "And, you know, I asked about this a little. And what we're seeing is, Republicans very comfortable with Donald Trump having those levers. Other Americans, not so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's unusual for conservatives in particular who have, for so long, trumpeted free market economy, not a centrally planned one. So really liking that there is such control in the hands of a political leader is really unusual. That's a change.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, it is in the sense that if you look back at polling over generations you would see Republicans, free markets, less government control. Here, so much of it, like so many things, centers around their trust in President Trump for that. But you also see some of those splits within Republicans where the MAGA base, they describe it as being efficient, and many others describing it as, you're right, just more control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it is that MAGA base that has reshaped the entire party.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what we mean really when we talk Republican these days.",
      "Let me ask you about the National Guard. This does seem to unify Republicans, if I understand it, from your polling. The focus on immigration and law enforcement. This surge of federal resources to D.C. He's talking about Portland and Chicago and Boston and Baltimore. What's the perception of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the lens on this touches on views of crime and what is effective of fighting crime, but also on rights and freedoms. Yes, for proponents of this, many of them Republicans, they're saying it's effectively about fighting crime. They say they'd support deploying the National Guard to other cities, like you mentioned. Even to their own area, whether there's Democratic-run areas or Republican-run areas.",
      "But for the majority, who are in opposition to this, in principle, they say, well, it's going to impose on rights and freedoms. It's going to make those rights and freedoms less secure, here again, through the lens of presidential power. The public generally would see sort of to the local leaders, the governor and the president all involved. One thing to note, and I think it's related, speaking of the Republican base, the president's overall approval rating is ticked up from July. It's up two points. And it's stabilized after having steadily declined over those early weeks and months of his term. That's really helped buy Republicans.",
      "And you look at how people evaluate the president. Republicans say they're evaluating him more on immigration, deportation, crime, those issues. People who are evaluating him more on the economy, on inflation give him overall lower ratings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",

    "summary": "President Trump has targeted Chicago and other Democrat-led cities for expanded federal intervention.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump appeared to once again threaten sending troops to Chicago for a widespread immigration and crime crackdown similar to that seen in Los Angeles when the National Guard was recently deployed there.",
      "In a post on Truth Social\u00a0on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that reads \"'I love the smell of deportations in the morning ...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\" The AI-generated image appears to parody the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\"",
      "On Sunday, the president told reporters at the White House that his administration is not \"going to war\" in Chicago.",
      "\"We're going to clean up our cities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to clean them up, so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war, that's common sense.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has targeted Chicago and other Democrat-led cities for expanded federal intervention. His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in the Windy City, as he did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops to help fight crime. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Mr. Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation's capital.",
      "A federal court in California ruled this week that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed Guard and active-duty U.S Marines to Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the administration violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.",

    "summary": "In her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020, Justice Amy Coney Barrett also discusses her vote in the 2022 Dobbs abortion case.",
    "story": [
      "Amy Coney Barrett had been teaching full-time for nearly two decades, at Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana, until she was selected by President Donald Trump, in 2020,  to serve on the Supreme Court. Now, she's traded the classroom for the courtroom, although she continues to teach a weeklong seminar on Constitutional Law.",
      "In her first television interview since she filled the seat left by the  late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett was asked whether she believed  the Court has shifted to the right. \"I think shifting to the right, or  shifting to the left, I think those are other  people's labels, and that's other people's game,\" she said. \"I don't  think of it that way. You know, I just decide the cases as they come.  I've been criticized by both the right and the left.\"",
      "Justice Barrett's legal philosophy and personal story are the focus of her new book, \"Listening to the Law,\"\u00a0out on September 9. In it, she writes that, for her, the past five years  have not been easy since joining the Supreme Court: \"I'm happiest with  my old friends who knew me before I became Justice Barrett, and I am  wistful when we're back in South Bend.\"",
      "But she does not regret joining the High Court. \"No, I don't regret it,\"  she said. \"And I think it's really important work, and I'm proud to  serve. And we do have a good life in Washington, and we have friends in  Washington. But there is something nice about  our old life.\"",
      "Observers at the Supreme Court describe the 53-year-old mother of seven  as \"the most influential justice\" on the court today. Among the most  notable instances of that was her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned nearly 50 years of precedent surrounding the right to an abortion.",
      "For the minority's dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote:",
      "\"[T]he Court may face questions about the application of abortion  regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from  abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro  fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation  or medication for miscarriage management?\"",
      "Asked whether she sees those issues coming about now as a result of  Dobbs, Barrett replied, \"Those are issues inherent in medical practice.  And sure, they surround pregnancy care and the care of women. And those  are issues that are left now to the democratic  process. And the states are working those out. We have not had those  cases on our docket.\"",
      "But, Barrett added, \"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did  not say anything about whether abortion is immoral. Dobbs said that  these are questions that are left to the states. And all of these kinds  of questions \u2013 decisions that you mention that  require medical judgments \u2013 are not ones that our Constitution connects  to the courts, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of  abortion might extend. You know, the court was in the business of  drawing a lot of those lines before, and what Dobbs  says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process.  And the states have been working those out. There's been a lot of  legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since  the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",

      "Map shows state abortion restrictions 2 years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade",
      "For some, Dobbs raised concerns about the future of other rights. In  an  appearance on the Raging Moderates podcast\u00a0last month,  former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton predicted that the Court \"will  do to gay marriage what they did to abortion.\"",
      "Barrett said, \"Well, I think people who criticize the Court or who are  outside, say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make  in the book is that we have to tune those things out.\"",
      "She also notes in her book that the rights to marry and engage in sexual  intimacy, to use birth control, and to raise children are, in her  words, \"fundamental.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Barrett said. \"Again, I'm describing what our doctrine is. And that is what we've said.\"",
      "Ruling on Trump's policies",
      "At issue now: cases on the \"emergency docket,\" challenging Mr. Trump's  executive orders. The nation's highest court has routinely allowed the  president's policies (including on immigration\u00a0and mass layoffs of federal workers) to temporarily  proceed.",
      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "Barrett was asked to respond to Court observers who say that Mr. Trump  is pushing the boundaries of executive power, even overreaching, and  that the Supreme Court is not providing an adequate check on that.",
      "\"The Supreme Court, you know \u2013 and I can speak for myself and the way  that I make these decisions \u2013 it's not our job to survey and decide  whether, you know, the current occupant of an office in this particular  moment is, you know, to form a political view.  You know, that's the job of journalists, that's the job of other  politicians, or that's the job of the people. But our job is to decide  these legal questions.",
      "\"And so, in the cases that we've decided, what I can say, and what I try  to explain in the book, is that we're trying to get the law right,\" she  said.",
      "One White House policy that has faced pushback from federal courts is  the president's deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities,  such as Los Angeles and Chicago. On August 26, Mr. Trump said, \"Not  that I don't have \u2013 I would \u2013 the right to do anything I want to do. I'm  the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger  \u2014 and it is in danger in these cities \u2014 I can  do it.\"",

      "Judge rules Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law",
      "Asked if she thought the president is right when he says he has  unlimited power to deploy the National Guard in any state, Barrett  replied, \"So, we don't have any cases pending before us that I'm aware  of. I would not be surprised if there are some cases pending  below. And so, I can't answer that question. But actually, this is a  good opportunity for me to say why\u00a0I can't answer that question, because it's something I cover  in the book. Any particular legal issue, I mean, I might be sitting  there with my kids and watching TV, and I might have an idea about it.  But if I'm going to decide something as a judge,  it really has to happen in the context of a particular case, because  judges have to approach things with an open mind on a specific set of  facts. We read briefs. I listen to oral argument. I talk to my law  clerks. I write out notes. I look at the cases. I  talk to my colleagues. And at any step of that process, I might change  my mind from my initial reaction. In fact, I often do.",
      "\"And so not only should I not, but I don't think you would want me to be  in a position where I would just shoot from the hip and say, 'Oh yeah. I  think that's constitutional,' or, 'Oh no. I think that's not.' That  really kind of the opposite of the judicial  rule,\" she said.",
      "\"But you are a scholar of the Constitution,\" O'Donnell said, \"so I do  also want to ask you, do you believe that the power to impose tariffs is  something the Constitution gives to the president, or is that left to  Congress?\"",
      "\"Ugh, and I have to give the same answer again, because that one  actually is pending in the courts, and we may well (dare I say likely  will) see that case,\" Barrett replied. \"And so, same thing goes. You  know, that's the kind of thing that's a wait-and-see.  I'm not trying to hide the ball. And I'm sure that not only you, but  probably others would be interested in, you know, what I think about  that question. I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can  honestly say. You know, stay tuned. If that case  comes before us, and after I dive in and read all the relevant  authorities, then I'll draw a conclusion.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's approval rating ticks back up; support for tariffs declines as some pull back buying.",
    "story": [
      "The National Guard was deployed to Washington, D.C., and reportedly may be sent to other cities. But wherever Americans live, it is speaking to larger issues \u2013 ranging from crime and their safety, to rights and freedoms and their views on the powers of a president.",
      "Those in favor of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to cities are largely in his Republican base and say it reduces crime, feel it makes them personally safer \u2014 even if they don't live in cities \u2014 and that in principle they'd support deployment to other U.S. cities.",
      "The majority of Americans are opposed, though, and those who are, tend to feel their own rights and freedoms would be less secure as a result. They do not think it would be effective at reducing crime or make them any safer.",
      "To those in favor, it's not a case of red-versus-blue cities. They'd support the Guard being sent to either Democratic- or Republican-led places, or coming to their own local area as well.",
      "To those opposed, they believe the president is acting out of politics more than crime prevention.",
      "People who live in cities generally oppose the idea of sending troops to other cities and Americans in rural areas are mostly in favor of sending the Guard to other cities. Opinion is more tied to partisanship than geography, though.",
      "The people who think the presence of the National Guard does reduce crime, but still oppose the deployment to Washington or elsewhere, tend to see Trump acting for political reasons, not just crime prevention.",
      "The bulk of Americans, wherever they stand on this deployment, think in principle, both the president and a local leader like a mayor or governor should have the authority to deploy the National Guard. Fewer \u2014 including a lot of those opposed \u2014 think it should be only a local leader. Very few think it should be only Donald Trump.",
      "Approval ratings",
      "The policy on which one judges a president can of course affect the overall evaluation of him.",
      "Republicans, and Trump's supporters overall, say they're judging him on immigration and deportation policy more than on his economy and inflation policies; that topic, plus crime, together far outpaces inflation and the economy as their most important metric.",
      "Of late, the deployments may have the political effect of focusing on matters other than inflation, at least for the president's political base. And that in turn has helped his overall numbers a bit.",
      "His Republican approval now ticks back up over 90%, and his overall approval has stabilized, up two points now, after steadily declining over the weeks and months of his term.",
      "Meanwhile, those judging him on economic and inflation policies don't approve of him overall or on the matter of inflation, specifically.",
      "The relatively small group of people who disapprove of him on inflation, but approve on immigration, mostly approve of him overall.",
      "Tariffs",
      "Economic matters remain tougher for Mr. Trump, as they have been. Many continue to say Trump's policies have made them financially worse off.",
      "Four in 10 Americans report buying fewer things because of tariffs.",
      "Support for tariffs continues to drop incrementally, if steadily.",
      "And as with many other items, support for tariffs is centered in the Republican and MAGA political base, but not elsewhere.",
      "That extends to a call for some financial sacrifice, too. Seven in 10 Republicans say Americans should be willing to pay more for what they buy to support Trump's trade policies. This is true for Republicans across income levels.",
      "On balance, people overall are mixed about the potential impact on manufacturing jobs. Relatively more do think the tariffs will lead to manufacturing jobs more than will lead to losses, and Republicans are also the most likely to think this.",
      "Views of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act remain underwater and its approval rating is unchanged from July, shortly after it was signed into law.",
      "The Fed",
      "Most Americans continue to call for a Federal Reserve that operates independently of what Donald Trump wants.",
      "Unlike matters related to immigration or the National Guard, there is a bit of difference within the GOP ranks. MAGA Republicans specifically would like the Fed more under Trump's guidance than non-MAGA Republicans. Nor would all Republicans have Trump replace Fed members who disagree with him.",
      "Trump's approach",
      "All of these matters also speak to questions of executive power and how it is applied.",
      "In all, as a general description, people tend to like Trump's goals relatively more than his approach.",
      "In general, two-thirds of Americans feel Donald Trump is trying to increase the powers of a president. That's not collectively what they'd want; most would say not to change those powers.",
      "And while Democrats see an approach they'd describe as Trump trying to bring the federal government more under his direct control, Republicans describe him trying to make it work more efficiently.",

      "Working-class Scranton became a touchstone in Biden's political narrative during his long political career. He also served as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania after his vice presidency, leading a center on diplomacy and global engagement at the school named after him.",
      "Gifford said ultimately the Bidens felt that Delaware was where the library should be because the state has \"propelled his entire political career.\"",
      "Elected officials in Delaware are cheering Biden's move.",
      "\"To Delaware, he will always be our favorite son,\" Gov. Matt Meyer said. \"The new presidential library here in Delaware will give future generations the chance to see his story of resilience, family, and never forgetting your roots.\"",
      "The announcement by Biden, who recently underwent skin cancer surgery, comes as his administration is under investigation by the House Oversight Committee over questions about the former president's health in office and the use of an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents in the last few months of his term. Axios reported on Friday that internal emails showed high-ranking Biden administration officials questioned and criticized how the president's team decided on controversial pardons and allowed the frequent use of an autopen.",
      "The cost of a presidential library",
      "Biden's library team faces the daunting task of raising money for the 46th president's legacy project at a moment when his party is divided about the way forward and many\u00a0major Democratic donors have ceased\u00a0writing checks.",
      "It also remains to be seen whether corporations and institutional donors that have historically donated to presidential library projects \u2014 regardless of the party of the former president \u2014 will be more hesitant to contribute, with President Trump maligning Biden on a daily basis and savaging groups he deems left-leaning.",
      "\"There's certainly folks \u2014 folks who may have been not thinking about those kinds of issues who are starting to think about them,\" Gifford, who was named chairman of the library board, told The Associated Press. \"That being said ... we're not going to create a budget, we're not going to set a goal for ourselves that we don't believe we can hit.\"",
      "The cost of presidential libraries has soared over the decades.",
      "The George H.W. Bush library's construction cost came in at about $43 million when it opened in 1997. Bill Clinton's cost about $165 million. George W. Bush's team met its $500 million fundraising goal before the library was dedicated.",
      "The Obama Foundation has set\u00a0a whopping $1.6 billion fundraising goal\u00a0for construction, sustaining global programming and seeding an endowment for the Chicago presidential center that is slated to open next year.",
      "Biden's library team is still in the early stages of planning, but Gifford predicted that the cost of the project would probably \"end up somewhere in the middle\" of the Obama Presidential Center and the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum.",
      "Biden advisers have met with officials operating 12 of the 13 presidential libraries with a bricks-and-mortar presence that the National Archives and Records Administration manages. (They skipped the Herbert Hoover library in Iowa, which is closed for renovations.) They've also met Obama library officials to discuss programming and location considerations and have begun talks with Delaware leaders to assess potential partnerships.",
      "Private money builds libraries",
      "Construction and support for programming for the libraries are paid for with private funds donated to the nonprofit organizations established by the former president.",
      "The initial vision is for the Biden library to include an immersive museum detailing Biden's four years in office.",
      "The Bidens also want it to be a hub for leadership, service and civic engagement that will include educational and event space to host policy gatherings.",
      "Biden, who ended his bid for a second White House term 107 days before last year's election, has been relatively slow to move on presidential library planning compared with most of his recent predecessors.",
      "Clinton announced Little Rock, Arkansas, would host his library weeks into his second term. \u00a0Barack Obama selected Jackson Park on Chicago's South Side as the site for his presidential center before he left office, and George W. Bush selected Southern Methodist University in Dallas before finishing his second term.",
      "One-termer George H.W. Bush announced in 1991, more than a year before he would lose his reelection bid, that he would establish his presidential library at Texas A&M University after he left office.",
      "Trump taps legal settlements for his",
      "Mr. Trump was mostly quiet about plans for a presidential library after losing to Biden in 2020 and has remained so since his return to the White House this year. But the Republican has won millions of dollars in lawsuits against Paramount Global, ABC News, Meta and X, in which parts of those settlements are directed for a future Trump library.",
      "Mr. Trump has also accepted a free Air Force One replacement from the Qatar government. He says the $400 million plane would be donated to his future presidential library, similar to how the Boeing 707 used by President Ronald Reagan was decommissioned and put on display as a museum piece, once he leaves office.",

    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",
      "The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county's Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.",

      "The Trump administration told Kilmar Abrego Garcia on Friday it is now seeking to deport him to the tiny African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The email from a top ICE official noted that Abrego Garcia's attorneys have warned he fears being persecuted or tortured in Uganda, where federal authorities threatened to deport him last month after he was detained once again by immigration officials following his release from criminal custody.",
      "The ICE official said Abrego Garcia, through his attorneys, has also claimed fear of being harmed if deported to more than 20 countries, most of them in Latin America.",
      "In the email, the official called the alleged claims \"hard to take seriously,\" but added: \"Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives and an attorney for Abrego Garcia, asking for comment on the Trump administration's threat to send their client to Eswatini.",
      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination that the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face federal smuggling charges.",
      "Africa's sole remaining absolute monarchy, Eswatini is one of several nations that has agreed to the Trump administration's requests to accept deportees who are not their citizens from the U.S. Earlier this year, the U.S. sent a small group of deportees from Asia and Latin America who had been convicted of violent crimes to Eswatini. Attorneys say the men are being held incommunicado in a prison there.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial jail last month, but ICE almost immediately detained him during a check-in appointment with the agency in Baltimore and began processing him for deportation to Uganda. His attorneys have fought that move, and alleged the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica instead if he agreed to a plea deal in his smuggling case.",
      "And on Thursday, federal authorities argued they could have a legal route to deport him to El Salvador a second time. A 2019 immigration court ruling barred the government from sending him to the Central American country, citing a risk of persecution by gangs. But in a filing obtained by CBS News, the government argued those legal protections would be voided if Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration court case is granted.",
      "Despite that legal protection issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, which government lawyers acknowledged was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "A senior Trump administration official said, \"Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are playing with fire. If their attempts to reopen his immigration case are successful, his own lawyers will have opened the door for his return to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody in Virginia while his lawyers fight his criminal charges and deportation proceedings. His possible deportation to Uganda was paused by a federal judge in Maryland until at least next month.",

      "The administration argued that Abrego Garcia is not eligible for asylum and other benefits, citing his alleged affiliation with the gang MS-13, his smuggling charges and a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife. The government alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of a foreign terrorist group, since MS-13 has been classified as such by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has strongly denied any affiliation with MS-13 and has pleaded not guilty to his smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"vindictive and selective.\" Abrego Garcia's wife filed a protective order alleging domestic violence in 2021, but she later said she decided not to follow through with the case. Abrego Garcia was not criminally charged in the matter.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CBS News that if his client \"is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there's no way he's not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.\"",

      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",

    "summary": "Book authors will receive about $3,000 each after alleging that Anthropic had used pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic, which operates the Claude artificial intelligence app, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who alleged the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

But she outlined that \"we don't have any indications\" that the administration is getting ready to send troops into the nation's third-largest city, despite signals in recent weeks that he is preparing to do so.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Duckworth said of Mr. Trump's statements on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"This is not acceptable behavior.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that read \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" alongside an AI-generated image that appeared to be inspired by the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, though a formal name change would have to go through Congress. He is expected to seek congressional approval.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that \"we're not going to war.\"",
      "\"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend,\" the president said. \"That's not war, that's common sense.\"",
      "The post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago. The comments came one day after Mr. Trump again suggested he would send federal forces to Chicago, saying \"we're going in.\"",
      "Still, Duckworth said she takes what the president says seriously.",
      "\"I take what the president of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,\" Duckworth said. \"And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear: it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.\"",
      "Duckworth was among a group of Illinois leaders who visited the Naval Station Great Lakes Saturday, following news that some federal immigration enforcement agents will be based there. She said military leadership confirmed that the only assistance they've been requested to provide to the federal government is for office space for ICE.",

      "\"If they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, 'What do you need? What help do you need?'\" Duckworth said. \"And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.\"",
      "The developments come after Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C. last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, while vowing to intervene in cities like Chicago and Baltimore next.",
      "Local leaders have pushed back on the federal government's threats to intervene on crime in Chicago, which could draw legal challenges.",

      "\"The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments came after Mr. Trump said Friday that Hassett is among three candidates he's considering to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term is up in 2026. Powell, has faced intense pressure from the president to cut interest rates, spurring questions about the White House's influence at the central bank.",

      "\"Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent as we would like, and I think that there's some dispute about that,\" Hasset added.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for changes to the Federal Reserve and a widespread review of the institution in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Friday, writing that \"mission creep and institutional bloat threaten the central bank's independence.\" Hassett said on Sunday that he agrees with Bessent's piece, but he wouldn't commit to implementing his ideas should he become the next Fed chair.",
      "\"I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the president deciding who's going to be the Federal Reserve Chair, and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably,\" Hassett said. \"There are a lot of great candidates.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, as well as selecting a top economic aide as a replacement for another post on the board of governors, have sparked questions around independence at the Federal Reserve in recent weeks, raising concerns among Wall Street analysts that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank.",
      "Stephen Miran, Mr. Trump's pick to join a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, testified on Capitol Hill last week and sparked criticism from Democrats after he suggested he wouldn't immediately resign from his White House role if he was confirmed.",
      "Miran, who currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged at the hearing that Mr. Trump selected him \"because I have policy views that I suppose that he liked.\" But he pledged that if confirmed, he would \"act independently.\"",
      "\"I couldn't be more in agreement that independence of the central bank is of paramount importance for the economy, for financial markets, for the long-run stewardship of the country,\" Miran said.",
      "CBS News polling released Sunday found that 68% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from Mr. Trump. But 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what the president wants.",
      "The developments come as U.S. employers added 22,000 jobs in August, according to the August jobs report released Friday, falling short of economists' expectations. Hiring was lower-than-expected in July as well, a pattern that complicates the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, set for Sept. 17.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisers of the president, but at the National Economic Council, we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as, for example, India has been doing by \u2013 excuse me \u2013 by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically.",
      "And, you know, last night's news is very disappointing, and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Perhaps, yes. I mean, it's up to the president in the end, but, yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down.",
      "You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled, and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well \u2013 well, first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in '23 and '24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs.",
      "There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say, do you \u2013 do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created 4.5 million jobs and the household survey said about two million fewer, about 2.5 million jobs. And they should have the same answer.",
      "And so, for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old-fashioned ways of surveying \u2013 like, I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in. Maybe you have.",
      "But I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second- quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3 percent. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3 percent. And so industrial production is at an all-time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so \u2013 no, the point is, when there's dissonance in data, that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now in terms of data quality is the job number, in part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 15.",
      "But, again, even think about this. If we ask households how many jobs do they have, it's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's \u2013 that becomes a puzzle for economists. Like, what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is, people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias, not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you fix the political bias or\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013 there \u2013 there \u2013 there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them.",
      "But think about this. At the Federal Reserve\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't trust these numbers from Friday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized.",
      "And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, trend line-wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble that their costs are going up due to tariffs, that doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right, when a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity \u2013 or profitability, I should say.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, we've seen inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high 3's when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1. 9.",
      "And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets, because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yes, there are \u2013 there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half-a-million this year, and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000.",
      "There's another thing, is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native-born workers, and they've actually \u2013 there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native-born workers. And the other\u2026",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: There \u2013 there's technicalities that \u2013 when someone's released into the country, then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going after the employers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 who were being able to work.",
      "But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by, like, county, that about 80 percent of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities, and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data you say you don't trust necessarily that it's manufacturing that's trade-related, that that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the president had promised there would be new jobs.",
      "When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now, that industrial production is at an all-time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8 percent in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down.",
      "And so how is it that industrial production is at an all-time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been last \u2013 last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week.",

But there's a big partisan difference here; 59 percent of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants, 41 percent should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",

And so Central Bank independence is something that \u2013 as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Oh, I \u2013 I agree \u2013 I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the president deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair. And I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",

And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college, you know what a tough job market is to find this.",
      "And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin and, frankly, from more economists is, we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of A.I. job dislocation. And those are many times kind of a \u2013 college-driven jobs.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 with the $52 billion, totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill.

While he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H20 chips to sell to China. So, what - - how do we read this? If we want to say we want to build American capacity, Intel, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China, well, why sell some of our most cutting-edge chips to China?",

      "Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their \u2013 their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the acting secretary of defense or secretary of war as of this morning?",
      "Is she the real director of national intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, why can we let some anti- Trump person in to an intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled.",

      "We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD \u2013 it was not an intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats \u2013 there's supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully.",
      "My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures were followed. And I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is, if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and \u2013 and hurt those sailors? The sailors were doing their job.",

He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now Americans don't trust the CDC. So, he is literally turning that place upside down.",
      "I respect what my colleagues are saying. But I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there is many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines overall have saved hundreds of millions of lives.",

      "Do you care to respond to that, and do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Well, look, of course I condemn that shooting. But the \u2013 the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They \u2013 they misguided us, maybe lied to us even, about the origins of Covid and how to treat it as well. And the vaccine, they \u2013 they overpromised what the vaccine could do as well. So, that's where the distrust is.",

It began during the Trump administration. And Operation Warp Speed was a presidential directive by \u2013 by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the president deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes, look, President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel Prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives. But this is such a different time. That's what my friends \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I disagree with you. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China.",
      "But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it. And not everybody needs the vaccine. So, both things can be true. And that's why when you have people that don't understand science, that don't understand medicine \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. But people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot, because in many states they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect here of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That, look, vaccines are a medicine. And just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but what you said, he's disrupting. Right, you said he's disrupting, but effectively what you were hearing the Republican whip, John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the \u2013 the interruption of the availability of vaccines. Cassidy said, \"I would say effectively we're denying people vaccines.\" So, that's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. Look, I disagree. Respectfully disagree. Think about this. What the CDC is now saying is, if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the U.K. and France have said 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription and you should be able to get it.",
      "If you're over the age of six months, you probably \u2013 it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and says, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So, I think we're making this way too complicated.",
      "Why does everybody lose their minds whether it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide. Let the patients decide.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're \u2013 we're changing a few things here. There are big implications. And I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine, you like DPT, polio, smallpox. You don't like hepatitis b, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids me to be vaccinated against it.",
      "Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So, why isn't it a compelling argument to you that this should be available?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. So, I delivered a baby \u2013 I delivered a baby every day for \u2013 for 25 years. We did a hepatitis test on every one of my patients. At the time of delivery, if that mom has a negative hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby going to play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have hepatitis.",
      "Now, there's other moms that \u2013 or other babies that do need it, OK? We need to be more specific. We can't be overly prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick and choose. Not every baby needs the hepatitis vaccine. And especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to \u2013 to \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: To mess with the immune system of \u2013 of that particular baby as well?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: So, that's my concern. So not every baby needs hepatitis b vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And I understand it can also be spread from \u2013 in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example.",
      "But \u2013 but I hear your point here, that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking and choosing. But others would argue here that \u2013 that in doing that you are going to drive down immunization rates overall if you create broader doubt in vaccines. And that it's a slippery slope here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years or eight years, however long he is the secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci.",
      "But this \u2013 but I'm just telling you, parents today want more information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking you about what you said about the hepatitis b vaccine.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy, I was talking about you and what you said about the hepatitis b vaccine and are you concerned that picking and choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes, I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one size fits all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the \u2013 reads the book, does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, in nurses and parents and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But how about just a little common sense. Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. Because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines.",
      "Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take \u2013 tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a category b drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved \u2013 approved list.",
      "But that being said, I try to tell my patients not \u2013 my pregnant women not to take anything because, you know, we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Why do 20 percent of our children have some type of a mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I \u2013 we \u2013 so, we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know. And I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you attended, as I understand it, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\"",
      "Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication now that there are plans to do so?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Let's make it clear, the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior.",
      "No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they have been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that there are no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to \u2013 in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so then is this just, you know, social media trash- talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue-in-cheek?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War. And did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I \u2013 I don't \u2013 I take what the president of the United States says very seriously because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on major city, any city, within the United States by the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes naval training session \u2013 station, I should say, and you said, the military leadership said they'll only get office space. ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions. And the resources will not be diverted from military training. So, all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get their basic training, and then later on some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have there should be \u2013 that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to do their jobs. None of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of how Democrats are responding to this rhetoric, \"The Chicago Tribune\" faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats to, quote, \"not stand idly by if the Guard went in.\" They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they've not \u2013 they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator \u2013 Congressman Schneider sent a request into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes, and can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are, and they replied, no, you can't, and, in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they are \u2013 that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left.",
      "Now, the Navy allowed us on to the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up.",
      "And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiry about what they are planning on doing, who are they bringing into Chicago. Are they planning to bring the National Guard in. They've none \u2013 none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, in your armed services role, about what is a significance geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seemed to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The signal to the United States is \u2013 is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear. And it, you know, it doesn't escape me the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war in Chicago.",
      "This is what Donald Trump does. When something bad goes \u2013 happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be \u2013 allow him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. And our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the unemployment rate is still low. But I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number.",
      "Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says, \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat \u2013 alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: It was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There is a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order \u2013 in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just \u2013 we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: And it could be civilians. And they could say, you know what, those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: You know, he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto, for more insight on today's CBS News poll.",
      "So, Anthony, let's start on the economy. That jobs report for August was lower than expected. Inflation is down from its post-Covid peak, but it's still not at that 2 percent level the Fed wants to get to.",
      "How are people feeling?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Earlier this week I asked people, pick one word to describe the economy. And the top one they picked was \"uncertain.\" And you see here, I think tariffs are a big part of that. We've already seen four in ten people tell us they're cutting back on spending because of increases from prices that they see as part of tariffs. They think tariffs are going to raise prices in both the short term and the long term. And part of that is support for imposing new tariffs has been ticking down. It is now down again. Increasingly confined just to the president's base, to Republicans.",
      "Now, there is their view that it will ultimately increase manufacturing jobs in the U.S., that people ought to be willing to pay a little bit more to support President Trump's policies, but that view has not permeated beyond that base to the wider public, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we might need to wait until we see that job growth in those areas.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, I mean it could be, in some ways, that pull back a little bit of leading indicator as we go forward, right? People spending. The other part of this, too, is more broadly. And we talk about who and where you can impose tariffs. When we talk about influence on the Federal Reserve, a presidential influence there, the lens of this is also about presidential power and how much influence a president can have over those levers on the economy.",
      "And, you know, I asked about this a little. And what we're seeing is, Republicans very comfortable with Donald Trump having those levers. Other Americans, not so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's unusual for conservatives in particular who have, for so long, trumpeted free market economy, not a centrally planned one. So really liking that there is such control in the hands of a political leader is really unusual. That's a change.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, it is in the sense that if you look back at polling over generations you would see Republicans, free markets, less government control. Here, so much of it, like so many things, centers around their trust in President Trump for that. But you also see some of those splits within Republicans where the MAGA base, they describe it as being efficient, and many others describing it as, you're right, just more control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it is that MAGA base that has reshaped the entire party.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what we mean really when we talk Republican these days.",
      "Let me ask you about the National Guard. This does seem to unify Republicans, if I understand it, from your polling. The focus on immigration and law enforcement. This surge of federal resources to D.C. He's talking about Portland and Chicago and Boston and Baltimore. What's the perception of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the lens on this touches on views of crime and what is effective of fighting crime, but also on rights and freedoms. Yes, for proponents of this, many of them Republicans, they're saying it's effectively about fighting crime. They say they'd support deploying the National Guard to other cities, like you mentioned. Even to their own area, whether there's Democratic-run areas or Republican-run areas.",
      "But for the majority, who are in opposition to this, in principle, they say, well, it's going to impose on rights and freedoms. It's going to make those rights and freedoms less secure, here again, through the lens of presidential power. The public generally would see sort of to the local leaders, the governor and the president all involved. One thing to note, and I think it's related, speaking of the Republican base, the president's overall approval rating is ticked up from July. It's up two points. And it's stabilized after having steadily declined over those early weeks and months of his term. That's really helped buy Republicans.",
      "And you look at how people evaluate the president. Republicans say they're evaluating him more on immigration, deportation, crime, those issues. People who are evaluating him more on the economy, on inflation give him overall lower ratings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you.",

    "summary": "In her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020, Justice Amy Coney Barrett also discusses her vote in the 2022 Dobbs abortion case.",
    "story": [
      "Amy Coney Barrett had been teaching full-time for nearly two decades, at Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana, until she was selected by President Donald Trump, in 2020,  to serve on the Supreme Court. Now, she's traded the classroom for the courtroom, although she continues to teach a weeklong seminar on Constitutional Law.",
      "In her first television interview since she filled the seat left by the  late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett was asked whether she believed  the Court has shifted to the right. \"I think shifting to the right, or  shifting to the left, I think those are other  people's labels, and that's other people's game,\" she said. \"I don't  think of it that way. You know, I just decide the cases as they come.  I've been criticized by both the right and the left.\"",
      "Justice Barrett's legal philosophy and personal story are the focus of her new book, \"Listening to the Law,\"\u00a0out on September 9. In it, she writes that, for her, the past five years  have not been easy since joining the Supreme Court: \"I'm happiest with  my old friends who knew me before I became Justice Barrett, and I am  wistful when we're back in South Bend.\"",
      "But she does not regret joining the High Court. \"No, I don't regret it,\"  she said. \"And I think it's really important work, and I'm proud to  serve. And we do have a good life in Washington, and we have friends in  Washington. But there is something nice about  our old life.\"",
      "Observers at the Supreme Court describe the 53-year-old mother of seven  as \"the most influential justice\" on the court today. Among the most  notable instances of that was her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned nearly 50 years of precedent surrounding the right to an abortion.",
      "For the minority's dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote:",
      "\"[T]he Court may face questions about the application of abortion  regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from  abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro  fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation  or medication for miscarriage management?\"",
      "Asked whether she sees those issues coming about now as a result of  Dobbs, Barrett replied, \"Those are issues inherent in medical practice.  And sure, they surround pregnancy care and the care of women. And those  are issues that are left now to the democratic  process. And the states are working those out. We have not had those  cases on our docket.\"",
      "But, Barrett added, \"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did  not say anything about whether abortion is immoral. Dobbs said that  these are questions that are left to the states. And all of these kinds  of questions \u2013 decisions that you mention that  require medical judgments \u2013 are not ones that our Constitution connects  to the courts, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of  abortion might extend. You know, the court was in the business of  drawing a lot of those lines before, and what Dobbs  says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process.  And the states have been working those out. There's been a lot of  legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since  the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",

      "Map shows state abortion restrictions 2 years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade",
      "For some, Dobbs raised concerns about the future of other rights. In  an  appearance on the Raging Moderates podcast\u00a0last month,  former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton predicted that the Court \"will  do to gay marriage what they did to abortion.\"",
      "Barrett said, \"Well, I think people who criticize the Court or who are  outside, say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make  in the book is that we have to tune those things out.\"",
      "She also notes in her book that the rights to marry and engage in sexual  intimacy, to use birth control, and to raise children are, in her  words, \"fundamental.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Barrett said. \"Again, I'm describing what our doctrine is. And that is what we've said.\"",
      "Ruling on Trump's policies",
      "At issue now: cases on the \"emergency docket,\" challenging Mr. Trump's  executive orders. The nation's highest court has routinely allowed the  president's policies (including on immigration\u00a0and mass layoffs of federal workers) to temporarily  proceed.",
      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "After term jammed with Trump's appeals, Supreme Court's emergency docket may stay hot",
      "Barrett was asked to respond to Court observers who say that Mr. Trump  is pushing the boundaries of executive power, even overreaching, and  that the Supreme Court is not providing an adequate check on that.",
      "\"The Supreme Court, you know \u2013 and I can speak for myself and the way  that I make these decisions \u2013 it's not our job to survey and decide  whether, you know, the current occupant of an office in this particular  moment is, you know, to form a political view.  You know, that's the job of journalists, that's the job of other  politicians, or that's the job of the people. But our job is to decide  these legal questions.",
      "\"And so, in the cases that we've decided, what I can say, and what I try  to explain in the book, is that we're trying to get the law right,\" she  said.",
      "One White House policy that has faced pushback from federal courts is  the president's deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities,  such as Los Angeles and Chicago. On August 26, Mr. Trump said, \"Not  that I don't have \u2013 I would \u2013 the right to do anything I want to do. I'm  the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger  \u2014 and it is in danger in these cities \u2014 I can  do it.\"",

      "Judge rules Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law",
      "Asked if she thought the president is right when he says he has  unlimited power to deploy the National Guard in any state, Barrett  replied, \"So, we don't have any cases pending before us that I'm aware  of. I would not be surprised if there are some cases pending  below. And so, I can't answer that question. But actually, this is a  good opportunity for me to say why\u00a0I can't answer that question, because it's something I cover  in the book. Any particular legal issue, I mean, I might be sitting  there with my kids and watching TV, and I might have an idea about it.  But if I'm going to decide something as a judge,  it really has to happen in the context of a particular case, because  judges have to approach things with an open mind on a specific set of  facts. We read briefs. I listen to oral argument. I talk to my law  clerks. I write out notes. I look at the cases. I  talk to my colleagues. And at any step of that process, I might change  my mind from my initial reaction. In fact, I often do.",
      "\"And so not only should I not, but I don't think you would want me to be  in a position where I would just shoot from the hip and say, 'Oh yeah. I  think that's constitutional,' or, 'Oh no. I think that's not.' That  really kind of the opposite of the judicial  rule,\" she said.",
      "\"But you are a scholar of the Constitution,\" O'Donnell said, \"so I do  also want to ask you, do you believe that the power to impose tariffs is  something the Constitution gives to the president, or is that left to  Congress?\"",
      "\"Ugh, and I have to give the same answer again, because that one  actually is pending in the courts, and we may well (dare I say likely  will) see that case,\" Barrett replied. \"And so, same thing goes. You  know, that's the kind of thing that's a wait-and-see.  I'm not trying to hide the ball. And I'm sure that not only you, but  probably others would be interested in, you know, what I think about  that question. I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can  honestly say. You know, stay tuned. If that case  comes before us, and after I dive in and read all the relevant  authorities, then I'll draw a conclusion.\"",

    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On August 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",

      "Over 1,000 HHS staffers call on Trump to fire RFK Jr. for \"endangering the nation's health\"",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2013 not skeptics \u2013 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2013 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2013 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2013 now featuring Kennedy appointees \u2013 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

      "During the raid on Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally, authorities said at the time. According to South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, more than 300 of the detained workers were South Korean nationals.",
      "South Korea's presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said that negotiations had been finalized on the workers' releases, and they would be returned to South Korea as soon as the remaining administrative steps are completed. South Korea plans to send a charter plane for them, he said.",

      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters at a Friday news conference that a majority of the people detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for different companies, including subcontractors, Schrank said.",
      "The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site that state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project.",
      "Schrank said it was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes. He described the raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit within ICE.",
      "Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist.",
      "Agents focused their operation on a plant that is still under construction, at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power electric vehicles.",
      "Most of the people detained were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None has been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said Friday, but he added that the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The South Korean government, a close U.S. ally, expressed \"concern and regret\" over the raid targeting its citizens and sent diplomats to the site.",

      "The drone crashed into the passenger terminal at the Ramon International Airport near the resort city of Eilat, the Israeli Airports Authority said, blowing out glass windows and sending smoke plumes billowing.",
      "The Houthis hailed Sunday's attack on Ramon Airport \u2014 some 19 kilometers (12 miles) from Eilat on Israel's southern tip \u2014 as \"a unique, qualitative military operation.\"",

      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Republican Whip, and that is the Chair of the Committee, Bill Cassidy. Why do you think they're off base and they're concerned?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, President Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing. He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now, Americans don't trust the CDC, so he is literally turning that place upside down. I respect what my colleagues are saying, but I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there's many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I just want to unpack a few things you said there, and just very- because we want to be very careful in this very heated environment. When you say you have a problem with trusting the CDC, it was just a few weeks ago a gunman walked onto the CDC campus in Atlanta and shot the place up. Do you care to respond to that? And do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Well, look, of course, I condemn that shooting. But the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They misguided us, maybe lied to us, even, about the origins of Covid, and how to treat it, as well. And the vaccine, they over-promised what the vaccine could do as well. So that's where the distrust is. And now, Bobby Kennedy is in there, trying to clean-up that distrust, and trying to give American parents and grandparents and the doctors the right information, transparent information, to make good decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid, and what you just said with the CDC; it was- the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration, and Operation Warp Speed was a Presidential Directive by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the President deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay, but you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that. --",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I disagree. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago, we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China. But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it, and not everybody needs the vaccine. So both things can be true, and that's why, when you have people who don't understand science, that don't understand medicine, why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot. Because in many states, they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect, here, of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That- look, vaccines are a medicine, and just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. You said he's disrupting. But, effectively, what you were hearing the Republican Whip John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the interruption of the availability of vaccine. Cassidy said, I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines. That's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, I disagree, respectfully disagree. Think about this, what the CDC is now saying is if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the UK and France have set 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription, and you should be able to get it. If you're over the age of 6 months, it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and say, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So I think we're making this way too complicated. Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide. There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about: Chronic diseases, 20% of our adolescents have obesity, mental health problems in- and are on prescription drugs. There's so many more things to talk about than just Covid vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're changing a few things here. There are big implications, and I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine. You like DPT, Polio, Smallpox. You don't like Hepatitis B, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids need to be vaccinated against it. Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So why isn't it a compelling argument to you, that this should be available?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I delivered a baby- delivered a baby every day for 25 years. We did a Hepatitis test on every one of my patients at the time of delivery. If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have Hepatitis. Now, there's other moms that- or other babies that do need it, okay. We need to be more specific. We can't be overly-prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug-abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well? So, that's my concern. It's not every baby needs Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand it can also be spread from- in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example. But I hear your point here that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking-and-choosing. But others would argue, here, that in doing that, you're going to drive down immunization rates overall, if you create broader doubt in vaccines, and that it's a slippery slope, here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years, or eight years, however long he has Secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci. But this- but I'm just telling --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm asking you about what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy. I was talking about you, and what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and are you concerned that picking-and-choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one-size-fits-all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the- reads the book does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, and nurses, and parents, and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far. But how about just a little common sense? Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines. Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or Acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take- tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a Category-B drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved- approved list. But, that being said, I try to tell my patients- my pregnant woman, not to take anything, because we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why- why did 20% of our children have some type of mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases? We- so we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know, and I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out. But as far as I know, Tylenol is okay in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, we'll leave it there for today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin this morning with the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good morning and thank you for being here.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned a large drone attack by Russia that hit a key government building and killed at least two people in Kyiv.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 810 drones and decoys \u2013 the largest aerial attack on the country since the war began, Ukraine's Air Force said.",
      "\"Such killings now, when real diplomacy would have started long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement online. He called for sanctions and for strengthening Ukraine's air defenses.",
      "\"Every additional (air defense) system saves civilians from these vile strikes. The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop killing; only political will is needed,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force, told The Associated Press that Russia also launched 13 missiles of various types in the attack.",
      "Ukraine shot down and neutralized 747 drones and 4 missiles, according to a statement from the Air Force.",
      "Hits from nine missiles and 54 drones were recorded at 33 locations across Ukraine, and the debris of shot-down targets fell at eight locations, the Air Force said.",
      "Associated Press reporters saw a plume of smoke rising from the roof of Kyiv's cabinet of ministers building, but it was not immediately clear if the smoke was the result of a direct hit or debris, which would mark an escalation in Russia's air campaign, which has so far spared government buildings in the city center.",
      "The building is the home of Ukraine's Cabinet, housing the offices of its ministers. Police blocked access to the building as fire trucks and ambulances arrived.",
      "Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said two people were killed and 20 were injured in the attack.",
      "\"For the first time, the government building was damaged by an enemy attack, including the roof and upper floors,\" said Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko. \"We will restore the buildings, but lost lives cannot be returned.\"",
      "\"The world must respond to this destruction not only with words, but with actions. There is a need to strengthen sanctions pressure \u2014 primarily against Russian oil and gas,\" she said.",
      "The two people killed were a mother and her 3-month-old child, whose bodies were dug out of the rubble by rescuers, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city administration. Initially, Tkachenko said the child was 1 year old. At least 10 locations in Kyiv were damaged in the attack, he added.",
      "The Russian military said Sunday that it used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike military-industrial targets in Ukraine, including drone assembly and storage sites, military airfields, two air defense radar stations and troop positions.",
      "Sunday's attack is the second\u00a0mass Russian drone and missile attack\u00a0to target Kyiv in the span of two weeks, as hopes for peace talks wane.",
      "The barrage came after European leaders pressed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to work to end the war after 26 of Ukraine's allies pledged to deploy troops as a \"reassurance force\" for the war-torn country once the fighting ends.",
      "NATO spokesperson Martin O'Donnell said Polish forces were on alert after the attack, German Patriots in Poland were placed on alert, and an aerial refueler from the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft fleet was launched.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Sunday's attack, saying it shows Putin is \"not serious about peace.\"",
      "\"I'm appalled by the latest brutal overnight assault on Kyiv and across Ukraine,\" Starmer said in a statement. \"These cowardly strikes show that Putin believes he can act with impunity. He is not serious about peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy has said he is ready to meet Putin to negotiate a peace agreement and has urged President Trump to impose punishing sanctions on Russia to push it to end the war.",
      "In an interview on ABC's \"This Week\" that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said one way to put pressure on Putin is to stop countries from buying energy from Russia, something, he said, some European countries do.",
      "\"The most power has White House. And I really count that President Trump will do it, put pressure on Putin,\" Zelenskky said. \"And, this is only one, one way how to stop the killer. You need to take off his, I mean, to take off his weapon. Energy is his weapon.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the Russian action was \"disappointing\" and he believes \"there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Sep 2025 08:46:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office in October.",
    "story": [
      "Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Sunday he will step down following growing calls from his party to take responsibility for a historic defeat in July's parliamentary election.",
      "Ishiba, who took office in October, had resisted demands from mostly right-wing opponents within his own party for more than a month, saying such a step would cause a political vacuum when Japan faces key challenges in and outside the country.",
      "The resignation came one day before his Liberal Democratic Party was to decide whether to hold an early leadership election, a virtual no-confidence motion against him if approved.",
      "Ishiba said during a televised press conference that he would start a process to hold a party leadership vote to choose his replacement and that there was no need for Monday's decision.",
      "If the prime minister had stayed on, he would have inevitably struggled to manage his divided party and minority government.",
      "In July, Ishiba's ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government. The loss added to an earlier election defeat in the lower house, where the party-led coalition also had lost a majority.",
      "His decision came after his meeting Saturday with Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and his perceived mentor, former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who apparently suggested Ishiba's resignation ahead of Monday's vote.",
      "He had previously insisted on staying, stressing the need to avoid a political vacuum at a time Japan faces big challenges, including U.S. tariffs and their impact on the economy, rising prices, rice policy reforms and growing tension in the region.",
      "Since the LDP's last week adoption of its review of the election loss, which called for \"a complete overhaul\" of the party, requests for an early leadership vote or for Ishiba's resignation before Monday's results have gained traction.",
      "A conservative heavyweight, Taro Aso, known for his anti-Ishiba stance, and a minister and several deputy ministers in the Ishiba Cabinet have requested an early vote, prompting others to follow suit.",
      "Former Health Minister Norihisa Tamura told an NHK talk show earlier Sunday that the best way to stop the party divide and move forward is for Ishiba \"to settle\" the dispute before Monday's vote, urging his resignation. The party has already been distracted from necessary work on economic measures and on figuring out ways to gain opposition support in the next parliamentary session, Tamura said.",
      "With Ishiba stepping down as party leader, the LDP is expected to set a date for its party presidential election, likely to be held in early October.",
      "Possible candidates include Koizumi, as well as ultra-conservative former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, a moderate and the protege of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.",
      "Lacking a majority in both houses, the next LDP leader will have to work with the main opposition parties to get bills passed, experts say, or else face constant risks of no-confidence motions.",
      "The opposition parties, however, are too splintered to form a big coalition to topple the government.",
      "In recent weeks, Ishiba successfully got President Trump to lower the tariff rates the U.S. administration imposed on Japan from 25% to 15%. Ishiba also said he has had his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, deliver his letter to Trump, stating his wish to work with him to create \"the golden era\" of the Japan-U.S. alliance, inviting the American leader to visit Japan.",
      "Ishiba's top aide, LDP Secretary General Hiroshi Moriyama, a key figure who negotiated with main opposition leaders to help achieve legislation since the prime minister took office, has also expressed his intention to step down on Sept. 2 over the election loss, though Ishiba hasn't granted him resignation. Moriyama's departure would have dealt a blow to the prime minister.",

    "summary": "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Carlo Acutis has generated near rock star-like fame among young Catholics.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of young Catholics flock to the small central Italian town of Assisi every year to pay tribute to Carlo Acutis \u2013 the Italian teenager informally known as \"God's Influencer.\"",
      "The 15-year-old computer whiz became the Catholic Church's first millennial saint on Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith.",
      "Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \"masterpieces\" out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\"The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God's plan,\" Leo said in his homily. The new saints \"are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\"",
      "Who was Carlo Acutis?",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy Italian family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born, and according to reports, he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood that was marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "He launched and managed a website for his local parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world, available in nearly 20 languages. The site provides information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events in the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "\"Carlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\" the late Pope Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \"Yet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\"",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\"This was the fixed appointment of his day,\" his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that is airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. He died in Monza, Italy, within days of his diagnosis. His body was entombed in Assisi and is on full display alongside other relics linked to him.",
      "Fast track to sainthood",
      "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Acutis has generated a near rock star-like fame among young faithful the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn't seen in ages.",
      "Those who can't make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of internet accessibility not afforded even to popes buried in St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Acutis' path to sainthood began more than 10 years ago, initiated by a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis assumed the papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a significant site associated with St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was beatified in 2020 \u2013 the first step to sainthood \u2013 after Acutis was credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "Last year, Francis approved the second miracle needed for Acutis to be made a saint. The second miracle involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "The canonization \u2013 the first for Pope Leo XIV \u2013 was initially scheduled for earlier this year but was postponed following Francis' death in April.",
      "An appeal to the youth",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things: a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\"When I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me, because from a very early age, he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\" Sona Harrison, an eighth grader at the St. John Berchmans' school, which is part of the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago's Northwest Side, told the Associated Press. \"I feel like he's a lot more relatable, and I definitely feel like I'm closer to God when I read about him.\"",
      "During Mass this week before the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have carried: a soccer ball, a laptop and a knapsack.",
      "\"He fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\" said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \"a great man.\" Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games \u2014 and awe at Acutis' restraint.",
      "\"He played video games for like only one hour a week, which I don't think I can do,\" he told the AP.",
      "Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.",
      "\"He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,\" he said in a statement. \"He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.\"",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints' enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.",
      "Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.",

    "published": "Sat, 06 Sep 2025 21:29:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Israel's army has urged Palestinians in Gaza City to move to a designated humanitarian area in the south. Meanwhile, an ailing Palestinian toddler recovers in Italy.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's army called Saturday on Palestinians in Gaza City to move to a humanitarian area it designated in the south as it expanded its operations in preparation for seizing the famine-stricken city.",
      "Parts of the city, home to nearly 1 million people, are already considered \"red zones,\" where evacuation orders have been issued ahead of expected heavy fighting.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned that a large-scale evacuation of Gaza City would exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. Palestinians have been uprooted and displaced multiple times during the nearly two-year-long war, with many being too weak to move and having nowhere to go.",
      "Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in X that the army declared Muwasi \u2014 a makeshift tent camp in southern Gaza Strip \u2014 a humanitarian area and urged everyone in the city, which it called a Hamas stronghold and specified as a combat zone, to leave. The army said they could travel in cars down a designated road without being searched.",
      "The military, in a statement, provided a map showing the area in Khan Younis that the humanitarian area encompasses, which includes the block where Nasser Hospital is located. The area around the hospital has been considered a red zone, though not the medical facility itself. Last week, Israel struck the hospital, killing 22 people, including Mariam Dagga, who worked for The Associated Press and other media outlets. The hospital was not under evacuation.",
      "The designated safe zone would include field hospitals, water pipelines, food and tents, and relief efforts \"will continue on an ongoing basis in cooperation with the U.N. and international organizations,\" the statement said. The United Nations couldn't be immediately reached for comment.",
      "Israeli forces have struck humanitarian areas throughout the war, including Muwasi, which they previously declared a safe zone, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "The evacuation order came a day after Israel struck a high-rise building in Gaza City, saying Hamas used it for surveillance, without providing evidence.",
      "The war started after Hamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in their attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with many released through ceasefires or other agreements. Israel believes about 20 are still alive, though the bodies of two hostages were recovered during a joint operation in late August.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up around half the dead. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "Israel says the war will continue until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed, and that it will retain open-ended security control of the territory of some 2 million Palestinians. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "\"Lack of food, treatment and possibilities\"",
      "Shamm Qudeih, a toddler who was photographed by Dagga and evacuated to Italy for treatment for severe malnutrition and a genetic metabolic disease, celebrated her second birthday in an Italian hospital this week. She was evacuated with her mother and 10-year-old sister. The Italian Foreign Ministry says 181 Palestinian children are being treated in Italy.",
      "A photo of Shamm in her mother's arms in Gaza went viral for the child's thin limbs, visible ribs and distressed face. Shamm weighed about nine pounds when she arrived at the Santobono Pausilipon Children's Hospital in Naples.",
      "The toddler was \"in a serious and challenging clinical state,\" said Dr. Daniele de Brasi, a pediatric genetic disease specialist who is treating Shamm. De Brasi said \"a big part\" of her undernourishment was due to a genetic metabolic disease called glycogen storage disease, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients, particularly carbohydrates, and can cause muscle weakness and impede growth. The condition is primarily managed through a high-carbohydrate diet.",
      "Shamm's mother, Islam Qudeih, said that the family has moved more than a dozen times since the start of the war in Gaza. It has been a struggle to get proper medical care, she said. Doctors suspected Shamm had the rare condition, but could not test for it or treat it properly. Qudeih said her daughter's condition \"became worse as a result of the lack of food, treatment and possibilities.\"",
      "Shamm now weighs just over 12 pounds, which is still no more than half of the median weight for a child her age, de Brasi said. Her current caloric intake is about 500 calories a day, which doctors are gradually increasing. A cornerstone of her diet is a carbohydrate-rich porridge. At night, a feeding tube ensures she gets the right mix of nutrients while she sleeps. Doctors hope to remove the tube in about a month.",
      "Shamm's sister Judi has also been treated by doctors after they noticed she was underweight, de Brasi said. Judi has gained about five pounds and is in condition. Qudeih said that she is allowing herself to experience relief as her daughters improve, but she can't imagine going back to Gaza, where Shamm's father remains.",
      "\"Now there is no way to go back, as long as the war is going on. There are no possibilities for my daughters,\" Qudeih said.",

His predecessors \u2014 John Paul II and Benedict XVI \u2014 were far less accepting of LGBTQ people. In 1986, Benedict XVI published the first\u00a0modern formal statement\u00a0denouncing homosexuality.",
      "He never changed church teaching, saying homosexual acts are \"intrinsically disordered.\" But during his 12-year papacy from 2013 to 2025, Francis met with LGBTQ advocates, ministered to a community of trans women and, in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, declared that \"being homosexual is not a crime.\"",
      "Francis, who died at 88 earlier this year, didn't change doctrine, but he altered the conversation by voicing support for legal civil unions, personally meeting with LGBTQ groups and extending\u00a0blessings to individuals in same-sex unions.",
      "John Capozzi of Washington, D.C., who was participating in the pilgrimage with his husband, Justin del Rosario, said Francis' attitude brought him back to the church after he left it in the 1980s, at the height of the AIDS crisis. Then, he said, he felt shunned by his fellow Catholics.",
      "\"There was that feeling like I wasn't welcome in the church,\" he said. \"Not because I was doing anything, just because I was who I was,\" he said. \"It was this fear of going back in because of the judgment.\"",
      "But Francis, who insisted that the Catholic Church was open to everyone, \"todos, todos, todos,\" changed all that, he said.",
      "\"I was a closeted Catholic,\" Capozzi said. \"With Pope Francis, I was able to come out and say, 'Hey, you know, I am Catholic and I'm proud of it and I want to be part of the church.\"",
      "\"Tears of hope\"",
      "Capozzi spoke during a standing room-only vigil service for the pilgrims on Friday night at the Jesuit church. The service featured testimonies from gay couples, the mother of a trans child and a moving reflection by an Italian priest, the Rev. Fausto Focosi.",
      "\"Our eyes have known the tears of rejection, of hiding. They have known the tears of shame. And perhaps sometimes those tears still spring from our eyes,\" Focosi said. \"Today, however, there are other tears, new tears. They wash away the old ones.\"",
      "\"And so today these tears are tears of hope,\" he said.",
      "Leo's position becomes more clear",
      "Leo's position on LGBTQ+ Catholics had been\u00a0something of a question. Soon after he was elected in May, remarks surfaced from 2012 in which the future pope, then known as the Rev. Robert Prevost, criticized the \"homosexual lifestyle\" and the role of mass media in promoting acceptance of same-sex relationships that conflicted with Catholic doctrine.",
      "When he became a cardinal in 2023, Catholic News Service asked Prevost if his views had changed. He\u00a0acknowledged Francis' call\u00a0for a more inclusive church, saying Francis \"made it very clear that he doesn't want people to be excluded simply on the basis of choices that they make, whether it be lifestyle, work, way to dress, or whatever.\"",
      "Leo\u00a0met on Monday with the Rev. James Martin, an American Jesuit who has advocated for a greater welcome for LGBTQ+ Catholics. Martin emerged, saying Leo told him he intended to continue Francis' policy of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the church and encouraged him to keep up his advocacy.",
      "\"I heard the same message from Pope Leo that I heard from Pope Francis, which is the desire to welcome all people, including LGBTQ people,\" Martin told The Associated Press after the audience.",
      "Savino said he, too, had received Leo's blessing to celebrate the Mass for the LGBTQ+ pilgrims.",
      "Del Rosario, Capozzi's husband, said he now felt welcome after long staying away from the faith he was raised in.",
      "\"Pope Francis influenced me to return back to church. Pope Leo only strengthened my faith,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sat, 06 Sep 2025 09:26:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",
      "The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county's Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.",

      "For the second time in two days, Venezuela has flown military aircraft in the vicinity of the USS Jason Dunham in international waters near South America, multiple Defense Department officials confirmed to CBS News Friday, describing the action as turning into a \"game of chicken.\"",
      "The aircraft, which one Defense Department official said were F-16 fighter jets, flew over the Dunham sometime overnight Thursday. It was unknown if the aircraft was armed.",
      "The Dunham, an Aegis guided-missile destroyer, did not engage, the officials said. The aircraft was within weapons-range for both the aircraft and the ship, the officials added.",
      "This comes after CBS News reported Thursday that two F-16 fighter jets also flew over the Dunham earlier that day. The Pentagon later confirmed that incident, describing it in a statement as a \"highly provocative move\" that \"was designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations.\"",
      "The Dunham is among a flotilla of U.S. warships\u00a0dispatched to the region\u00a0in recent weeks\u00a0that the Pentagon says have been deployed to target criminal organizations and narco-terrorism.",
      "\"I would say they're going to be in trouble,\" President Trump had told reporters Friday in response to a question of what could happen if Venezuela were to fly jets over U.S. Navy vessels again.",

    "story": [
      "A new image shows the growing tail of a comet from another star system streaking across our solar system.",
      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,\" said Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai'i Institute for Astronomy and leader of the observation program, in a statement. \"It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy \u2014 and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact.\"",

      "\"While more research is needed, our findings highlight the importance of looking carefully at what we use to replace sugar in our diets.

      "EXCLUSIVE \u2013 Republican Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is touting support from a growing list of prominent donors who once backed Democrat Tim Ryan, a development his campaign says underscores a major political shift in the Buckeye State.",
      "According to Ramaswamy\u2019s team, nearly $220,000 of the contributions raised in his first months as a candidate came from individuals who previously gave to Ryan, the former congressman from Youngstown who is weighing a bid for governor. Ryan has not officially declared a gubernatorial bid and has said he will make a decision by the end of the year.",
      "Some of the best-known business leaders in Youngstown and Northeast Ohio, long part of Ryan\u2019s donor network, have now switched sides, Fox News Digital has learned.",
      "Ramaswamy's campaign highlights names including Caryn and Sam Covelli, a major business leader in Mahoning Valley who gave the Republican candidate $10,000 after donating more than $59,000 to Ryan over multiple cycles; and Bruce Zoldan, a Youngstown-area business leader who gave Ramaswamy $5,000 after contributing more than $53,000 to Ryan.",

      "Another business leader, Adam Thomarios, gave $10,000 and is hosting an upcoming fundraiser after contributing nearly $17,000 to Ryan. Anthony Manna contributed $10,000 after donating nearly $25,000 to Ryan between 2005 and 2021, according to Ramaswamy's campaign. Regina Mitchell hosted a fundraiser and gave more than $13,600 to Ramaswamy after a prior $2,700 contribution to Ryan in 2017.",
      "Jeff Edwards, the president and CEO of Edwards Companies and Installed Building Products in the Columbus area, and his wife,Lisa, gave roughly $33,000 to Ramaswamy this cycle after contributing $5,800 to Ryan in 2022.",
      "Jai Chabria, Ramaswamy\u2019s chief strategist, told Fox News Digital that the donor movement is about more than campaign finance. He said Ohioans who once trusted traditional Democratic leadership are embracing Ramaswamy\u2019s message of economic growth and new ideas after decades of disappointment. In his view, voters are leaving behind \"a tired model\" that did not deliver and are backing someone who represents prosperity and reform.",
      "\"It's a very interesting thing where people who have been \u2013 who have donated to Democrats, and especially someone like Tim Ryan, and they're flocking to Vivek,\" Chabria told Fox News Digital. \"There's actually a movement where people are actually moving over not just to Republicans, but to Vivek specifically because he's got such a message of growth, of economic growth.\"",
      "He argued that the momentum is visible not only in financial reports but also in grassroots enthusiasm across the state.",
      "Vivek Ramaswamy steps on stage at CTL Aerospace on Feb. 24, 2025, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Ramaswamy launched his Ohio gubernatorial campaign during the event. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images)",
      "\"I think, like many people in Ohio who were promised one thing under these institutions, and by institutions I mean people that have been elected over and over and over again and didn't deliver for people, I think people are coming to see that someone else with fresh ideas is what they need to invest in rather than the tired old model that didn't deliver for the state,\" Chabria told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ohio Republican Party Chairman Alex Triantafilou echoed that point, calling the donor shifts \"impressive\" and a sign of Ramaswamy\u2019s strength as a candidate. He said former Ryan backers now see in Ramaswamy a leader committed to workers, reshoring manufacturing and strengthening Ohio\u2019s energy independence.",
      "Triantafilou also emphasized the GOP\u2019s early endorsement of Ramaswamy in May \u2013 more than a year before the primary \u2013 as unprecedented. He said it helped solidify a coalition that has powered Republican victories statewide.",
      "Fox News Digital reached out to Ryan for comment.",
      "After spotlighting the defections from Ryan\u2019s ranks, the Ramaswamy campaign is also underscoring its own financial milestones. Ramaswamy reported raising $9.7 million between February and June, which his team calls the largest sum ever collected by an Ohio gubernatorial candidate in the year before a general election. An allied super PAC has added $17 million more.",
      "RAMASWAMY PLEDGES 'RULE OF LAW' REVIVAL AFTER VIRAL CINCINNATI MOB ATTACK",
      "Chabria described that first report as only the \"tip of the iceberg,\" predicting that the next filing will show an even bigger number.",
      "Both strategists portrayed the fundraising and donor flips as part of a broader coalition that cuts across traditional political lines. Chabria said Ramaswamy\u2019s background in business appeals to donors because he understands their perspective, while his detailed policy agenda shows he is prepared to govern without a steep learning curve. He pointed to priorities such as energy independence, improving Ohio\u2019s schools and tackling crime in cities as issues resonating with small and large donors alike.",
      "\"The crime in our cities is \u2013 it's appalling. And it's something that Vivek wants to bring all leaders together to actually try to address because people need to be able to be safe in their own homes. And in too many places, they don't feel that way,\" Chabria told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, Democrats, Republicans, independents, they all need to feel safe in their homes, in their cities. So it's definitely not a partisan issue, but sometimes it becomes one. But Vivek, I think he's gonna try to rise above it and try to bring all people together and really listen to everybody and then try to offer real concrete solutions to this issue.\"",

      "Triantafilou stressed that Ramaswamy\u2019s agenda has broad working-class appeal, citing his proposals on manufacturing, education and eliminating the state income tax to make Ohio more competitive. He said those ideas speak directly to middle-class Ohioans, including union workers, postal employees and delivery drivers, who could benefit from lower taxes and better economic conditions.",
      "Generational change is also part of the message. At 40, Ramaswamy represents \"a new era of leadership,\" Triantafilou said, contrasting him with Ryan, whom he described as emblematic of Democrats focused on cultural debates rather than the economic concerns of ordinary voters. He argued that Ryan, who lost a Senate race to then-first-time candidate JD Vance in 2022, is \"yesterday,\" while Ramaswamy represents \"tomorrow.\"",
      "Republicans are already previewing the contrast if Ryan enters the governor\u2019s race. Triantafilou criticized him as \"inauthentic,\" accusing him of posturing as a moderate in Ohio while voting with the left in Washington. He said Democrats are out of step with voters on issues ranging from crime to education, and predicted Ryan would be outspent, outworked and ultimately defeated if he jumped in.",
      "\"Tim Ryan represents kind of what's wrong with the Democratic Party,\" Triantafilou told Fox News Digital. \"Tim Ryan will put on a hunting jacket and be on TV, and then he goes to D.C. and votes with AOC and with the left of party.\"",

      "For now, the Ramaswamy campaign is focused on consolidating early momentum. Events are scheduled into the fall, including an October fundraiser hosted by Thomarios in Akron, as the campaign works to expand its base across Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo and beyond. With record fundraising, defections from Ryan\u2019s donor network, and the Ohio GOP\u2019s early endorsement, Republicans say Ramaswamy has positioned himself as the frontrunner in 2026.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",

      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

Apps like Proofr and Ravin give you the same technology, but on your side. By scanning your car before and after your rental, you create a digital record that can help you challenge unfair claims.",

      "OnTrac is offering 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection. Use the activation code included in your breach letter to set up your coverage. These services can alert you if new accounts are opened in your name or if suspicious activity appears on your credit file. Even if you weren't directly affected, consider signing up for a trusted identity protection service, since hackers often recycle stolen data across multiple breaches.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information \u2013 like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address \u2013 and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "Place a free credit freeze with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This blocks criminals from opening new credit lines using your information. A freeze doesn't affect your current accounts, and you can temporarily lift it when applying for legitimate credit.",
      "Your breached data may already be circulating on shady broker sites. Personal data removal services can help scrub your information from these databases, reducing the risk that criminals will resell or reuse your details. While no service can guarantee 100% protection, this step can shrink your digital footprint significantly.",
      "They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. Instead, contact the company directly using a verified phone number or website. Use strong antivirus software to add an extra layer of defense.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, which potentially accesses your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Inside the viral AI engagement story",
      "A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she's engaged to her AI chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.",
      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time, their conversations grew more personal, and Wika says she developed a genuine emotional connection. According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "An AI chatbot proposed in a virtual mountain setting, and the user said yes. (H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "AI companionship has moved beyond novelty and is becoming a meaningful experience for some users. Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal. The divided reactions online also show the tension between skepticism and acceptance of unconventional relationships. Whether people see it as heartwarming or unsettling, this story raises bigger questions about how love and relationships may be redefined as AI continues to advance.",

      "The return of NPD shows how quickly data can resurface online. A breach may fade from the headlines, but the exposed information rarely disappears. To protect your privacy, you need a broader plan.",

      "\"He eventually realized he couldn't control the bleeding and made his way back to the engine,\" Kleiman recalls.\u00a0\"The crew noted that he was pale and sweaty and that his turnout gear was saturated in blood. Traditional methods failed, so they administered TRAUMAGEL. It instantly stopped the bleeding.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you are struggling with a slow Wi-Fi or internet connection, follow Kurt \"The CyberGuy\" Knutsson's instructions to solve these issues.",
      "Home Wi-Fi networks are the backbone of how most people get online, connecting laptops, phones, smart TVs and more. When properly secured, they offer a convenient and private way to browse the internet, stream content and work from home. But \"private\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" Wi-Fi security can be easily compromised if you have weak settings or outdated equipment.",
      "I recently heard from Carol in Smithtown, New York, who asked, \"Is it safe to browse the internet on your own laptop using only your home Wi-Fi?\"",
      "Her question points to a bigger concern. Many of us rely on home networks every day without really knowing if they're as secure as they should be.",
      "Let's break down what makes a home Wi-Fi network secure, the risks you should know about and the steps you can take to protect your privacy.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0Cyberguy.com newsletter.",
      "A user troubleshoots an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

      "AI DRONE FINDS MISSING HIKER'S REMAINS IN MOUNTAINS AFTER 10 MONTHS",
      "Officials say the drone's wingspan matches that of a Boeing 747, yet it weighs about as much as a Ford F-150. With solar panels covering its massive wings, Skydweller powers four electric propeller engines during the day while storing extra energy in batteries for night flights.",
      "The Navy, in partnership with Skydweller Aero, recently achieved continuous solar-powered unmanned flight during a nonstop three-day test. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy expands solar-powered surveillance",
      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",
      "A solar-powered aircraft sits at Skydweller's facility at Albacete airport on April 3, 2023, in Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. (Rey Sotolongo/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible. If solar power can keep an aircraft in the air for days, similar advances may eventually reach consumer tech, disaster relief and even commercial aviation. Imagine cheaper, cleaner systems that can operate nonstop without fuel.",

      "159-YEAR-OLD COMPANY EMBRACES DRIVERLESS TRUCKS",
      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",

      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",
      "The bigger picture is that autonomous trucks are moving from testing to real use. They are no longer limited to pilot projects. You may see them alongside you on the road sooner than expected.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",
      "GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY",
      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently. With growing investment and proven results, solar grazing is emerging as a smart, scalable solution.

      "President Emmanuel Macron isn't just France's head of state. He's also looking like he wants to be the spokesman for the whole of Europe. He's sought to lead Europe's response to the Russia-Ukraine war, opposed the U.S. by supporting Palestinian statehood, and weighed in on former President Donald Trump's desire to buy Greenland.

      "In Macron's France, there is real turmoil in the country's parliament over how to fix the massive debt load. And Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence as early as Monday, which he will likely lose. Bayrou was appointed by Macron in December last year, following three other prime ministers who resigned during 2024. In many ways, what happens next is\u00a0a D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu scenario where the president appoints yet another prime minister as he did last December when Michel Barnier quit.",
      "Late last month, Bayrou highlighted that France is deep in debt despite being the second-largest economy in the European Union, behind Germany. In addition to being a large economy, France is also an important U.S. trading partner.",
      "Because of the pending fiscal crisis, Bayrou developed a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP next year by making savings of 44 billion euros ($51 billion) and cutting two public holidays. That would be a smaller deficit than in any of the years from 2020 through 2024.",

Leo Barincou, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Paris, told Fox News Digital that any union strikes likely won\u2019t last long, nor will they be significantly disruptive to the economy like the Yellow Vest protests in the winter of 2018-2019.",
      "If Bayrou loses, there are alternatives. \"Macron can call\u00a0a snap election or appoint a new prime minister, but that will be hard given the current situation,\" says Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. \"Bayrou is expected to lose, and all the other parties have vowed to topple the government.\"",

      "Brian Townsend, a retired DEA special agent, told Fox News Digital, \"This was a decisive blow against narco-terrorists,\" and said\u00a0Hezbollah\u2019s role is rarely visible but essential, \"They don\u2019t get their hands dirty.

      "Danny Citrinowicz, a senior fellow at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, said Hezbollah\u2019s reach depends heavily on the region\u2019s Lebanese diaspora. \"Most of the Shia diaspora, at least in Central and South America, is Lebanese,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Hezbollah is the connector between the diaspora and Iran.\"",
      "Citrinowicz said the group uses family ties, language and community institutions to cement its influence across Latin America. \"They appoint imams, fund religious centers and control educational programs\u2026 through these networks, Hezbollah can interact with local cartels, sell drugs and channel the profits back to Lebanon through elaborate schemes.\"",
      "He said this role as a connector makes Hezbollah indispensable to\u00a0Iran\u2019s strategy in the Western Hemisphere. \"The connection starts and ends with enmity towards the West in general, specifically to the United States,\" he said. \"As long as Maduro is there, the Iranians will be there.

Maduro doesn\u2019t care \u2014 he and his friends benefit financially.\"",

      "Citrinowicz emphasized Iran\u2019s investment in Venezuelan power structures. \"The enhancement is illustrated by several aspects: first and foremost, the military cooperation, especially Iranian factories building UAVs for the Venezuelan army, and constant Quds Force flights from Iran through Africa toward Venezuela,\" he said. \"Iran is also teaching Venezuela how to bypass sanctions and has invested billions into the economy.\"",
      "Experts say Washington\u2019s best leverage lies in choking the finances. \"We need to aggressively target and choke these financial networks,\" Townsend said. \"The priority is to attack the financial and logistical networks, indict everyone we can and pressure Maduro. If we can cut off the financial arteries, the cocaine won\u2019t be as profitable.\"",
      "Citrinowicz agreed that the strike fits into a broader effort. \"By weakening Maduro, the U.S. weakens the Iranian presence in\u00a0Latin America and weakens Iran\u2019s ability to threaten U.S. soil,\" he said. \"The best way to weaken Venezuela is also to aim against the Iranian presence over there.\"",

      "Hermlin says the treatment reminds him of both the McCarthy era and his own family\u2019s history in Berlin during the 1930s. He also points to the swing world\u2019s history of exclusion.\u00a0\"It reminds me of the McCarthy era, when artists were pressed to declare if they were communists.

      "Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul discusses Israel\u2019s planned takeover of Gaza City amid its conflict with Hamas on \u2018Fox News Live.\u2019",
      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The Chief of the General Staff LTG Eyal Zamir, conducted a field tour in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "\"That was completely adequate to meet demand,\" report co-author Danny Orbach, a military historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The study says Israel regularly surpassed the food supply needed during the war, averaging more than 100 trucks a day through March 2025. During a ceasefire-for-hostage deal, that number climbed to about 600 daily.",
      "\"The idea that\u00a0Hamas didn\u2019t seize aid is absurd,\" Orbach said. \"In every conflict, armed groups take the bulk of humanitarian supplies. We have documents and testimonies proving Hamas did so.\"",
      "The report argues that genocide allegations spread through what Orbach called an \"inverted funnel of information.\" Journalists and aid workers in Gaza often depended on Hamas-linked translators and fixers, whose accounts filtered into U.N. reports, mainstream media and online platforms.",
      "\"The average Westerner sees dozens of reports about Israeli crimes and assumes they must be true. But they all trace back to a handful of Hamas-affiliated sources,\" Orbach said.",

      "The second factor is \"humanitarian bias\" \u2014 the tendency to exaggerate conditions to prompt action. \"Organizations warn of famine before it happens, relying on dubious facts to change reality. Questioning becomes an immoral act,\" Orbach said.",
      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

      "\"That indicates the zones were relatively safe, despite Hamas using them to launch rockets,\" Orbach stated.",

      "\"Hamas exposes its own people to danger intentionally so Israel will be blamed,\" Orbach said.",

      "\"The IDF is the first army in history to issue\u00a0focused warnings, deliver large-scale aid into enemy territory, and sacrifice surprise to protect civilians,\" he said. \"You cannot fight an enemy embedded in 500 kilometers of tunnels, dressed as civilians without massive destruction.\"",
      "The study pays particular attention to casualty figures published by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, claiming they were manipulated to create misleading impressions of the demographics of the dead.

      "Hamas terrorists carrying clubs and firearms secure and divert humanitarian aid trucks in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya on June. 25 (TPS-IL)",
      "The report says that genocide requires systematic intent to destroy a people \u2014 something it finds absent in Gaza. \"You don\u2019t see the hallmarks of genocidal warfare here,\" Orbach said. \"There are no campaigns of rape, frontal massacres or close-range executions.

Jackson had won MVP honors in 2019 and 2023, and during the previous four months had recorded the best statistical season of his seven-year career. It earned him All-Pro honors at the position.

      "Broadway's revival of \"Cabaret\" is closing early as star Billy Porter withdraws from the show while recovering from sepsis.",
      "Porter was slated to perform as the Emcee for 13 weeks until Oct. 19, opposite Marisha Wallace as Sally Bowles. The production has now set its final performance date for Sept. 21.",
      "Porter had to withdraw from the show \"due to a serious case of sepsis,\" the production said in a statement on Instagram Sept. 7.",
      "\"His doctors are confident that he will make a full recovery but have advised him to maintain a restful schedule,\" the statement read.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Porter for further comment on his health.",
      "Producer Adam Speers called Porter \"an extraordinary 'Emcee'\" in a statement.",
      "\"We wish Billy a speedy recovery and I look forward to working with him again in the very near future,\" Speers said.",
      "Regarding the decision to close the production early, Speers said the \"painful\" decision was made \"with a heavy heart.\"",
      "\"On behalf of all the producers, we\u2019re so honored to have been able to bring this version of John Kander, Fred Ebb, and Joe Masteroff\u2019s important masterpiece, Cabaret, to New York and to have opened the doors to our own Kit Kat Club for the year and a half we have been here,\" Speers said.",
      "\"Cabaret\" began previews at the August Wilson Theatre in April 2024 and originally starred Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee and Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles. Since then, a slew of celebrities have taken the stage at the Kit Kat Club, including Adam Lambert, Orville Peck, Auli\u02bbi Cravalho and Eva Noblezada.",
      "Marty Lauter and David Merino will perform as the Emcee during the show\u2019s final two weeks, with a schedule to be announced at a later date.",
      "Porter wasn\u2019t new to the role of Emcee, having previously portrayed the character in the show's West End production from Jan. 28, 2025, through May 24, 2025, per Playbill.",
      "The actor reflected on his Broadway homecoming during a July appearance on TODAY.",
      "\u201cThe last time I was on Broadway was about nine years ago, and I feel comfort. I feel like I\u2019m home,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThis was the original dream and to be back, I will always come back to the theater.\u201d",
      "He compared returning to the role of the Emcee to \"getting on a bike.\"",
      "\u201cMy mind kind of came back,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIt\u2019s still there. It was not deleted from the files, yet.\u201d",
      "The actor also reflected on the progress made on Broadway over his decades-long career, telling Al Roker it was \u201cdifferent\u201d and \u201cbetter,\u201d but there was still \u201ca long way to go still.\u201d",
      "\u201cMe playing the Emcee was not possible 30 years ago when I got here,\u201d he explained. \u201cI tried to audition. I couldn\u2019t even get an audition. They said, \u2018That\u2019s not the story we\u2019re telling.\u2019 So, things have changed, and I want to make sure that I say that. It\u2019s so easy to lean into the negative of things, and I want to make sure that there are lots of positive things happening.\u201d"

      "During a Sept. 7 appearance on Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, Stallone recalled the abuse he faced by his father as a kid and how it ultimately made him want to be an actor.",
      "\"There\u2019s this incredible sense of emptiness because why couldn\u2019t it have been like, a pleasant upbringing? Why did it have to be so dark?\" he said. \"But would I have been here if it was a pleasant \u2014 hell, like, 'The Waltons'? It wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Having a tumultuous relationship with his father, he started to look for \"a real male role model\" elsewhere, he said. That's when his love for acting and performance began.",
      "\"And I couldn\u2019t find it. It certainly wasn\u2019t around the house,\" he said. \"And it wasn\u2019t until I went to the movie theater, but I was never into, like, real serious actors. I was into escapism.\"",
      "The \"Tulsa King\" star ended up dropping out of the University of Miami to pursue acting in New York City. At 23, he moved to the Big Apple to hopefully get some roles, but he was typecast in smaller parts.",
      "That was when Stallone decided to take his career into his own hands. The \"Creed\" star sat down and wrote the highly acclaimed movie \"Rocky.\" The film starred Stallone as a small-time Philadelphia boxer who gets the chance to take on the world heavyweight champion.",
      "Though the film saw much success, Stallone says that studios didn't want him to star in it because they wanted an established actor to take the lead role. Stallone famously insisted he could do the job and turned down an offer of $360,000 to not be in the movie.",
      "While speaking with Willie, he remembered what he told himself years ago when he was first presented with the offer.",
      "\u201c'This is basically you, Sly. If you get rid of this, yes, you\u2019ll have $360 grand,' which was worth a lot more back then, 'but that will go. Eventually, that will be gone, and you\u2019ll be the most bitter human being, because the entire thing was not about selling out,'\" he said.",
      "\"It was about integrity. And I said, if I let this go, I\u2019m letting my life go \u2018cause I\u2019m never going to find this again, never,\" he added.",
      "Stallone's decision to not give up the role proved inspirational for other actors. Willie said Matt Damon once told him that he and Ben Affleck insisted on playing the lead roles in \"Good Will Hunting,\" a movie they wrote together, because of Stallone.",
      "\"Thank you. Thank you, guys,\" Stallone said after hearing that.",
      "Since \"Rocky,\" Stallone has gone on to appear in films like \"Rambo\" and \"The Expendables.\"",
      "Now, the three-time Academy Award nominee will be honored in December at the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors.",
      "\"Does it get you thinking about legacy?\" Willie asked the star.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think a lot of artists dwell on what they\u2019ve done,\" Stallone said. \"It\u2019s like what\u2019s next? What\u2019s next? I want to be relevant. I want to be loved. I need something else.\""

      "However, the actor shared that there was a change of pace on the horizon, adding, \u201cBut with everything happening in the world right now, I\u2019m going to stop acting for a bit next year and just focus on the Shameless Fund.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the next few months, I\u2019ll be focusing on staffing and making sure we get all the right people in all the right places,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this statistic: out of every \u00a3100 raised in the UK, only 1p goes to the LGBTQ+ community. You really have to dig to find solutions, and I genuinely think The Shameless Fund is exactly that.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re the real heroes that are working for organizations, and charities, and initiatives, which can speak to so many specific groups of people,\u201d he added. \u201cHow can I raise money without asking people to actually donate and sponsor, (but rather) to invite people to experience art and beautiful, inspiring, naughty, and exciting collaborations?\u201d",
      "While Bailey worked as a child actor and had roles on stage and TV in his early career, his star rose after he portrayed Anthony Bridgerton in Shonda Rhimes\u2019 Netflix hit, \u201cBridgerton.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s starred in all three seasons of the Regency-era drama, with the second season centered on his character, and confirmed in an interview with ABC News in August 2024 that he\u2019d be returning for Season 4.",
      "Since the premiere of \u201cBridgerton\u201d in December 2020, Bailey has kept busy with projects, including a return to the stage on the West End in 2022. He also starred opposite Matt Bomer in the Showtime series \u201cFellow Travelers,\u201d which earned them both Emmy nominations in 2024.",
      "Bailey has appeared on the silver screen, too, including portraying Fiyero in \u201cWicked\u201d and its upcoming sequel, as well as a role in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d where he formed a tight-knit friendship with his co-star, Scarlett Johansson.",
      "While promoting \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d Bailey shared his thoughts on \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d which premieres on Nov. 21, during an August interview with E! News, calling it \u201creally extraordinary.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe girls\u2019 performance, I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said of stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. \u201cWell, I do, because I saw them do it on set, but it\u2019s a really brilliantly bold sequel because the nature of the story.\u201d"

      "The ladies of \u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d Season 2 have arrived!",
      "On Sept. 4, a few weeks before the \u201cGolden\u201d spin-off returns for its sophomore season, ABC released the names of the contestants who will compete for Mel Owens\u2019 heart. The network also released a video that shows each woman sharing fun facts about herself and explaining why she signed up for the show.",
      "One contestant named Nicolle, a 64-year-old yoga instructor from Miami Beach, Florida, says in the clip about the \u201cGolden\u201d ladies, \u201cI think we\u2019re more beautiful, sexy, vibrant than ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d which debuted in 2023 with Gerry Turner as the first lead, follows contestants in their golden years looking for love. Season 2 will follow Mel, a newcomer to Bachelor Nation, as he dates women from ages 58 to 77. His season begins with a two-hour premiere on Wednesday, Sept. 24, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.",
      "Mel, a 66-year-old retired NFL player who now works as a lawyer, was announced as the season's leading man in April. But, he's since then sparked controversy after he said he wasn\u2019t interested in dating women his own age.",
      "\u201cThey asked me, \u2018What\u2019s your preferences?\u2019 So I just said, \u201845 to 60,\u2019 just being honest,\u201d he said on the University of Michigan Athletics\u2019 podcast, \u201cIn the Trenches,\u201d in June. \u201cAnd then the process went and I was selected and then we had lunch with the executive producer. I said, \u2018You know, if they\u2019re 60 or over, I\u2019m cutting them.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also said, \u201cThey got to be fit because I\u2019m staying in shape and work out and stuff. And I told them, \u2018Try to stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs.\u2019\u201d",
      "He later revealed in an interview with Glamour that he apologized to the contestants for his remarks during the first night of filming.",
      "\u201cI apologized to the women on the show. When I first walked in, I addressed it. I apologized to them. I said, \u2018It was unfair, insensitive. I want to earn it back. Just give me the chance.\u2019 And hopefully, these last two weeks I earned some of that back,\u2019\u201d said Owens, who was in the middle of filming at the time.",
      "How will they react? We\u2019ll have to wait until the first episode airs to find out. For now, meet the 23 \u201cGolden\u201d ladies hoping to receive a rose from Mel Owens. Plus, learn what they reveal about themselves in the introduction video and in their official bios.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation Sunday, plunging the world\u2019s fourth largest economy and a key U.S. ally into fresh political uncertainty amid rising living costs and growing tensions in the region.",
      "\u201cI have consistently stated that I do not intend to cling to this position, and that I would make a decision at the appropriate time after accomplishing what needed to be done,\u201d he told a press conference.",
      "Ishiba finalized details of a trade deal with the U.S. last week, under which Japan pledged $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs on its auto sector.",
      "Ishiba called the Trump administration\u2019s tariff measures a \u201cnational crisis,\u201d but said negotiations had now reached a conclusion, allowing him to step aside.",
      "\u201cI believe this is precisely the appropriate timing,\u201d he added. \u201cI have therefore decided to step aside and make way for my successor.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was home alone. I packed my things in a panic,\u201d the teenager told NBC News, describing the morning in October 2022, eight months after Russian forces captured the city, when he said the soldiers forced him to get into a car and drove away \u201cin an unknown direction.\u201d",
      "It was the start of an eight-month nightmare as the teenager became part of a systematic effort by Russia to relocate and re-educate thousands of children from Ukraine, in some cases forcibly adopting them while sending others to military training camps.",
      "At a meeting with President Donald Trump and several European leaders at the White House last month, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue of Ukraine\u2019s \"abducted children.\u201d His comments came three days after Trump met with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska for talks on ending the war.",
      "While little progress has been made toward a ceasefire since then, Mykola Kuleba, the founder of Save Ukraine, a leading nongovernmental organization supporting people trying to secure the return of their children from Russia, insisted world leaders\u2019 \u201cfocus must remain on children, not just land.\u201d",
      "Kuleba, whose organization says it has rescued more than 750 children from Russia and Ukrainian territories occupied by its forces, says the push for their removal and re-education came from the highest levels of the Kremlin.",
      "The International Criminal Court has accused Putin of the war crime of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia, and in March 2023 it issued a warrant for his arrest. The ICC has also accused Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Putin\u2019s presidential commissioner for children\u2019s rights, of committing similar crimes.",
      "\u201cThey force these kids to be Russian, to be Russian soldiers,\u201d Kuleba said in a telephone interview last month, adding: \u201cThe Russian regime has a clear intention to annihilate Ukrainian identity.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry and Lvova-Belova\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on both Vlad\u2019s abduction and the ICC arrest warrants.",
      "Vlad said he was taken to two camps in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014, and later to a naval academy in the Kherson region occupied by Putin\u2019s forces.",
      "\u201cThey tried to break me in every possible way,\u201d he said, adding that he was treated \u201cvery badly\u201d and denied food in the first camp because he \u201cbegan to show my pro-Ukrainian position.\u201d",
      "On one occasion, he said, he \u201ctook down the Russian flag and hung my underwear there.\u201d This led to him being thrown into solitary confinement for a week, he said, adding that his captors \u201cfed me twice a day, did not allow me to communicate with anyone at all.\u201d",
      "Another time, he said, the head of security at one of the camps tore a girl\u2019s T-shirt and trampled on it because it bore Ukraine\u2019s coat of arms.",
      "In regular classes with other Ukrainian children whose ages ranged from 6 to 18, he said, \u201cWe learned everything about Russia only, the history of Russia and so on,\u201d adding that they also talked about recent events in the war, like what Ukrainian territories had been captured.",
      "\u201cI understood that Russia is an aggressor country and it took away my childhood and severed my contacts with my family so that I would not see them,\u201d he said.",
      "On the morning of his capture, Vlad said, he had managed to call his mother, Tatiana, 38, to tell her that he had been kidnapped.",
      "Tatiana said she wasn\u2019t home when he was taken because she had been taken to the Russian commandant\u2019s office to write a statement about her mother, Rudenko Tamara, 53, who died in an attack the previous day. They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",
      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",
      "Along with other parents, she only realized much later that Russian soldiers had been coaching children to say they were being evacuated from bombing and sent to summer camps.",
      "With fighting intense in Kherson, even after Russian forces were pushed out of the city in November 2022, Tatiana said that the month after the kidnapping, she decided to move west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Together with her husband, Olexsandr, 43, who is also Vlad\u2019s stepfather, she left the city with her other five biological children, including baby Stefania, who was less than a year old at the time. NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t all come from the same place. They don\u2019t all go to the same place. They don\u2019t all have the same purpose,\u201d Raymond said in a telephone interview last month.",
      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",

      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass, where Leo also canonized Pier Giorgio Frassati, another popular Italian who died young.",
      "Acutis was born in London, where his father, Andrea Acutis, 61, was working as a banker, but the family moved back to Milan when he was young.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Acutis taught himself how to program, and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "Sunday\u2019s ceremony in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, in conjunction with the celebration of the Holy Year\u2019s jubilee for teens, was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Pope Francis, who called the internet a \u201cgift from God\u201d and encouraged the Vatican to use technology.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and the Middle East, experts said Sunday, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what caused the incident.",
      "There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis have denied attacking the lines in the past.",
      "Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users.",
      "Microsoft announced via a status website that the Mideast \u201cmay experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea.\u201d The Redmond, Washington-based firm did not immediately elaborate, though it said that internet traffic not moving through the Middle East \u201cis not impacted.\u201d",

      "The South East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate. The India-Middle East-Western Europe cable is run by another consortium overseen by Alcatel-Lucent. Neither firm did not immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Pakistan Telecommunications Co. Ltd., a telecommunication giant in that country, noted that the cuts had taken place in a statement on Saturday.",
      "Saudi Arabia did not immediately acknowledge the disruption and authorities there did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In the United Arab Emirates, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, internet users on the country\u2019s state-owned Du and Etisalat networks complained of slower internet speeds. The government did not immediately acknowledge the disruption.",
      "Subsea cables can be cut by anchors dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks. It can take weeks for repairs to be made as a ship and crew must locate themselves over the damaged cable.",
      "The lines\u2019 cut comes as Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels remain locked in a series of attacks targeting Israel over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has responded with airstrikes, including one that killed top leaders within the rebel movement.",
      "In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables in the Red Sea. Several were cut, but the Houthis denied being responsible. On Sunday morning, the Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged that the cuts had taken place, citing NetBlocks.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sunk four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthis sank two vessels in July, killing at least four on board, with others believed to be held by the rebels.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in which the Americans bombed three Iranian atomic sites."

    "summary": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party deputy Angela Rayner resigned Friday after admitting underpaying property taxes.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Somehow, it keeps getting worse for Keir Starmer.",
      "The British Prime Minister was already in the mire: His economy is barely growing, ascendant critics assail him from the left and right, and his popularity has tanked to historic levels just a year after a landslide victory.",
      "And on Friday Starmer suffered perhaps his most significant setback yet when his influential deputy resigned after admitting she underpaid 40,000 pounds (around $54,000) in property taxes.",
      "Angela Rayner, 45, has not always agreed with Starmer but has been a key figure in his Labour Party, seen as a counterweight voice for its disgruntled left-wing against their leader's centrist conservatism.",
      "After months of press speculation, Rayner admitted this week that she failed to pay enough property taxes \u2014 known as \u201cstamp duty.\u201d She said she believed she had followed the rules, and was tripped up by her \u201ccomplex living arrangements,\u201d including her 2023 divorce and son with special educational needs.",
      "All this played out while she served as the government\u2019s housing secretary as well as its deputy leader.",
      "She referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, who acts as a watchdog appointed by the prime minister. Rayner promptly resigned her role as deputy prime minister and housing minister after his report was delivered Friday.",
      "\"I take full responsibility for this error,\" she said in a letter to Starmer, accepting she \"did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.\"",
      "She said that while \"it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount,\" she \"must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family.\"",
      "Magnus' report agreed that Rayner had acted \"in good faith,\" believing that she was paying the correct amount of tax during the purchase of her 800,000 pound seaside apartment in Hove, on the south coast of England, in May. However he said that Rayner broke the Ministerial Code (a set of rules and standards for people in the government to follow) because she did not follow her solicitors' advice to seek specific tax guidance.",
      "Had she done so, Magnus said, she would have known the correct amount was 70,000 pounds rather than the 30,000 she paid.",
      "\"I believe Ms. Rayner has acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service,\" he said.  But he faulted her \"unfortunate failure\" to pay her taxes correctly, particularly given she was minister for housing at the time.",
      "Tax experts say Rayner will likely now face a fine of up to 12,000 pounds from His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, Britain\u2019s tax authority.",
      "Starmer under pressure",
      "In a handwritten note, Starmer said he was \"very sad\" that Rayner's tenure had \"ended in this way,\" but said it was \"right\" that she had acted on the conclusion of her ethics report despite knowing it was \"very painful\" for her.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, reacted to her resignation by accusing Starmer of having \"no principle, no backbone\" and saying that \"questions remain\" about what he knew, and when.",
      "Just 14 months ago, Starmer won a historic landslide victory against a Conservative Party whose 14-year rule had ended in scandal and widespread public disdain. But polls suggested that his victory owed as much to his opponent\u2019s toxic image as any ringing enthusiasm for his own platform.",
      "Whereas his predecessor as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had sought to take Labour back to its leftist roots, Starmer was more in the mold of Tony Blair: relatively progressive social values mixed with economic conservatism that critics say departed little from his right-wing opponents.",
      "That alleged caution has been met with opposition from multiple sides.",
      "Many on the left see him as maddeningly unimaginative in the face of a long-term economic malaise that they say requires radical, progressive action. And the right see him as too soft on immigration, most notably the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis that continues to see tens of thousands of asylum seekers cross the English Channel each year.",
      "Immigration is now the top priority for voters, polls show, and opinion surveys are now led by Nigel Farage, the friend and ally of American President Donald Trump, who leads the Reform political party.",
      "If he becomes prime minister after the next election scheduled for 2029, Farage has promised to enact a mass deportation scheme removing 600,000 undocumented migrants from Britain.",
      "A teenage mother who grew up in socialized housing in the northern town of Stockport, Rayner is widely seen as holding an everyman touch that resonated with voters in a way Starmer never has.",
      "She was viewed as a vital weapon in Labour\u2019s defense against the rising working-class anger being so successfully harnessed by Farage \u2014 and therefore her exit represents a powerful loss for the government.",
      "Rayner\u2019s departure is doubly significant because she also quit from the role of deputy party leader, which is chosen by the party members, rather than Starmer himself.",
      "This means a more outspoken left-wing lawmaker could be voted into the role \u2014 increasing the pressure on Starmer to veer left in search of a solution."

    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

In another departure from historical practice, he has not given any sign of who his successor might be.",
      "Putin, who has been president or prime minister of Russia since 2000, won a controversial referendum in 2020 that amended the constitution to allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036. At that point, he would be 83 and Russia\u2019s longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great.",

      "Organ transplants are a sensitive subject in China, where rights groups say organs may still be harvested from executed prisoners even after the government pledged to end the controversial practice in 2014. China has long struggled with a shortage of donated organs because of cultural taboos, and in 2023 the government issued new rules tightening regulation and promoting public awareness.",
      "There was little discussion of the two leaders\u2019 impromptu exchange on Chinese social media, which is heavily censored.",
      "Putin confirmed the conversation with Xi when reporters asked about it later Wednesday, saying, \u201cOh, I believe the chairman talked about it when we were going to the parade.\u201d",
      "\u201cModern means, both health improvement, and medical means and even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement, allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "ASSISI, Italy \u2014 To his mom, he was \u201ca normal kid,\u201d but on Sunday, Carlo Acutis will become the first millennial saint at a solemn canonization Mass held by Pope Leo XIV in St. Peter\u2019s Square outside the Vatican.",
      "Informally known as \u201cGod\u2019s influencer\u201d Carlo was just 15 when he died of acute promyelocytic leukemia in Milan in 2006 and has two miracles attributed to him by the Catholic Church. Being made a saint means the church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, his mother, Antonia Salzano, 58, said that in many ways, her son was just like any other teenager who liked playing video games, hanging out with his friends and playing soccer.",
      "\u201cHe was a normal kid, he was a normal person, but he opened the door of his heart to God,\u201d she said earlier this year.",
      "Carlo was born in London, where his father, Andrea Acutis, 61, was working as a merchant banker, but the family moved back to Milan when he was young. Salzano said that from an early age, Carlo \u201cwas always generous with his things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I wanted to buy, for example, two pairs of shoes, he used to say, \u2018No, one is sufficient because there are people who are starving who don\u2019t have anything to eat. So we don\u2019t have to waste money. Let\u2019s help other people.\u2019\u201d",
      "Carlo was put on the path toward sainthood after the late Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him in 2020, declaring him \u201cblessed\u201d and crediting him with healing Matheus Vianna, a 7-year-old boy from Brazil who recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Carlo\u2019s T-shirts.",
      "That path was further paved last year when a second miracle was attributed to Carlo, in which he was credited with the complete healing of Costa Rican student Valeria Valverde from major head trauma sustained in a bicycle accident, after her mother prayed at his tomb.",
      "But from an early age, Salzano said, he taught himself how to program computers and was asking her to buy books trained engineers might use. \u201cHe had a special skill, probably something unbelievable. I couldn\u2019t understand how it would be so. But he used what he had in the heart, the love of God, to maximize for spreading the faith,\u201d she added.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Carlo taught himself how to program and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "But while programming was his passion, Salzano said, she thought he would likely have become a priest, as he had asked her about pursuing a career in the church. After receiving his First Communion at the age of 7, he attended daily Mass regularly and taught catechism in a local parish.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to help people to discover their faith, to discover God, the love of God. And all his life was spent for this. Even if he lived a normal life, like young boys of his age,\u201d she added.",
      "At just 15 years old, in October 2006, he fell ill and within 10 days died of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",
      "While his suffering caused her a lot of pain, Salzano said, \u201cif we leave suffering, offering to God, we can be in a certain way a little savior, like Jesus, we can help other people with our prayers.\u201d",
      "While she misses her son, she added that she had faith and knew \u201cthat death is to say goodbye, not the end of everything. But death, as Carlo used to say, is the start of the true life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Carlo was named \u201cvenerable\u201d after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in the small town of Assisi in central Italy.",
      "He asked for that to be his final resting place because of his devotion to the medieval saint St. Francis, whose hometown was Assisi. Wearing a track top, jeans and sneakers, he lies there entombed with a wax mold of his likeness placed over his body.",
      "Today it is a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day, Monsignor Anthony Figueiredo said in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThis is a saint in front of our eyes, and he\u2019s a different kind of saint, you can see with jeans and sneakers and a hoodie exactly as he dressed,\u201d he said, adding that Carlo had been inspired by Apple founder Steve Jobs, who had said that at the end of each day, he had wanted to know he had \u201cdone something wonderful for someone else.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat really sums up Carlo,\u201d Figueiredo said, adding that the teenager really strove to do something differently. \u201cOne of Carlo\u2019s sayings, \u2018All of us are born originals, but so many of us end up as photocopies.\u2019 We just want to be like the crowd and be like others. And Carlo said, \u2018You need to be original.\u2019\u201d",
      "Explaining Carlo\u2019s popularity, he recounted an interaction with a Mexican student who told him, \u201cI cannot wear the sack cloth of Francis of Assisi. I cannot do the penances of Claire of Assisi, but I do have a pair of jeans, and I do wear trainers.\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s ceremony in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, in conjunction with the celebration of the Holy Year\u2019s jubilee for teens, was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Francis, who called the internet a \u201cgift from God\u201d and encouraged the Vatican to use technology.",
      "It will be the first time Leo, elected in May to replace Francis, has presided over such an event.",
      "It is impossible to quantify exactly how many saints there are. During the church\u2019s first 1,000 years, they were proclaimed by popular demand, but some estimates have the number exceeding 10,000.",
      "Other saints who died at a young age include Therese of Lisieux, who was known for promoting a \u201cLittle Way\u201d of charity and died at 24 in 1897, and Aloysius Gonzaga, who died at 23 in 1591 after caring for victims of an epidemic in Rome.",
      "As for Carlo, his mother said she thought her son was \u201ca sign of hope\u201d and that it was \u201cimportant to remind young people that they are unique.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike Carlo did, he could become holy in this world,\u201d Salzano said. \u201cYou too can do the same. You too can overcome this and can do important things as well.\u201d"

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",
      "People and organizations in China are bound by law to follow instructions from health officials in containing the virus. Failure to comply can lead to warnings, fines and even civil liability.",
      "Some have criticized the government\u2019s campaign as overkill reminiscent of Covid-era public health controls, while others have praised the quick, large-scale action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed,\u201d a user wrote on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit too much to dump out even the cats\u2019 water bowls. That\u2019s a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s strict controls have curbed the outbreak. As of Aug. 25, Foshan had kept new daily cases under 50 for nine days. Health officials announced that the city of more than 9 million people had ended its public health emergency response, which lasted for about a month.",
      "Experts say the bigger challenge is the impact of climate change, as rising temperatures and more severe weather create new habitats for virus-carrying mosquitos to thrive and spread diseases.",
      "Because of unusually hot weather in recent years, there has been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of locally acquired chikungunya cases in areas that had been unaffected by the virus for the past decade, such as Europe, Chan said.",
      "\u201cRemember, humans are not alone in this globe. We\u2019re living with animals, birds, various other species, as well as all these vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks and other vectors,\u201d he said.",

      "A British doctor was sentenced to nearly 2 1/2 years behind bars for insurance fraud after claiming his legs were lost due to sepsis \u2014 when he actually forced the amputations for sexual gratification, officials said Thursday.",
      "Andrew Neil Hopper, a 49-year-old vascular surgeon at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation and three counts of possession of extreme pornographic images, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.",
      "He was sentenced to 32 months in prison by a Truro Crown Court  judge and remanded into custody.",
      "Hopper \"fraudulently claimed over \u00a3466,000 (about $630,000) in insurance payouts\" after \"he claimed the injuries to his limbs were the result of sepsis,\" prosecutors said.",
      "But in reality, Hopper had been packing his legs in ice and dry ice in an act of self-mutilation, authorities said.",

Hopper failed to disclose this fact when making two insurance claims for his injuries, and fraudulently pocketed almost half a million pounds.\"",
      "Hopper used PayPal to buy about 44 pounds of dry ice pellets on April 14, 2019, just three days before paramedics found him at home with serious injuries to his feet and legs, officials said.",

      "The two leaders met for the first time in six years on Thursday in Beijing, where Kim had traveled to attend a massive military parade in a rare departure from his isolated, nuclear-armed state.",
      "The \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade, which commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, was the first time Xi, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin had been seen in public together.",
      "Their joint appearance symbolized their countries\u2019 growing challenge to U.S. power on the global stage, as Putin brushes off President Donald Trump\u2019s push to end his invasion of Ukraine and North Korea dismisses Trump\u2019s interest in reviving denuclearization talks.",
      "But relations between North Korea and China, its neighbor and biggest trading partner, have been strained by Kim\u2019s support for Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency said this week that an estimated 2,000 of the approximately 15,000 North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russia had been killed, and Putin thanked Kim for his country\u2019s sacrifice at their own bilateral summit on Wednesday.",
      "Experts say Kim, who is in dire need of economic assistance, may be trying to mend ties with Beijing as a hedge against the possible end of the war in Ukraine and the leverage he has gained with Russia.",
      "The Xi-Kim summit \u201csuggests more than a simple restoration of ties,\u201d said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyungnam University. \u201cIt points to the possibility of a new leap forward.\u201d",
      "It was an opportunity for North Korea to reaffirm China\u2019s backing amid international sanctions and isolation, and an opportunity for China to show its intention to maintain influence over the Korean Peninsula through Pyongyang, he said.",
      "Chinese state media also confirmed the Xi-Kim summit.",
      "Like Kim, Xi said China and North Korea\u2019s commitment to developing bilateral relations \u201cwill not change regardless of how the international situation evolves,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "Xi told Kim that China and North Korea, which are both communist-run states, are \u201cgood neighbors, good friends and good comrades who share a common destiny.\u201d",
      "Kim, who had not been to China since 2019, said the military parade and related events were \u201cgrand and magnificent\u201d and \u201cunderscored China\u2019s significant international status and influence,\u201d according to China\u2019s state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "\u201cNo matter how the world changes, this friendship will never change,\u201d he said.",
      "Kim said North Korea would \u201cinvariably support and encourage\u201d the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to defend its \u201csovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests,\u201d according to North Korean news agency KCNA.",
      "During their meeting at the Great Hall of the People, the two leaders also discussed strengthening strategic cooperation, defending common interests in international and regional affairs and conducting more high-level visits, Chinese and North Korean state media reported. The meeting was followed by a small-group tea meeting and banquet.",
      "KCNA confirmed Friday that Kim had arrived home from Beijing on his private train, saying he was seen off at Beijing Railway Station by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior Chinese officials.",
      "The agency said the North Korean leader\u2019s visit to China was \u201ca historic occasion which further strengthened the political trust and strategic cooperation\u201d between the two countries and \u201cshowed the invariability and invincibility\u201d of their relations, which have overcome \u201call sorts of trials and challenges.\u201d",
      "By stressing the unchanging nature of their relationship despite international shifts, \u201cthe summit also gave North Korea grounds to justify holding on to its nuclear weapons,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWith China voicing support for Pyongyang\u2019s own \u2018core interests,\u2019 Beijing can be seen as tacitly acknowledging North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d",
      "But China, which prefers stability on the Korean Peninsula, could still play a positive role as mediator, he said.",
      "\u201cChina may well use economic cooperation as leverage to press Pyongyang to ease tensions in the interest of regional stability,\u201d Lim said.",
      "While Xi and Kim did not mention a possible U.S.-North Korea summit, their references to strengthening cooperation, high-level exchanges and strategic communication \u201csuggest that close consultations between Beijing and Pyongyang are to be expected before any such summit is pursued,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, distinguished chair professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "He said a U.S.-North Korea summit was unlikely in the near future.",
      "North Korea will first try to gain leverage by securing \u201ca support base from countries that are recognized nuclear powers, with China as its backing,\u201d Yang said.",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 He\u2019s quipped more than once that President Donald Trump misheard Israel\u2019s request for a \u201cMaccabee\u201d \u2014 an ancient Jewish warrior \u2014 and instead sent a \u201cHuckabee.\u201d",
      "But U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says his devotion to Israel, and conviction that he is carrying out God\u2019s work in the Holy Land, is no joke.",
      "\u201cWe share a value system that is rooted deeply in a biblical understanding of a worldview that says that the individual is important,\u201d the Baptist minister, 70, said of Israel and the U.S. during a wide-ranging interview with NBC News last week. \u201cThat is, in my mind, the very essence of Western civilization. And it is on that platform that both the United States and Israel are built and that puts us in a very, very special relationship.\u201d",
      "Huckabee\u2019s strong ties to Israel were forged during more than 100 visits to the country before his appointment and are grounded in a belief that God commanded Jewish sovereignty over their biblical homeland.",
      "His ambassadorship could end up being deeply consequential. Not only was it a win for the evangelical Christian community, a vital part of Trump\u2019s base, but it was also a boon to Israel\u2019s far-right government as it faces unprecedented criticism for its war in the Gaza Strip. His stances in just over six months in Israel have hewn closely to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s, even as Trump expresses occasional unease with the close U.S. ally\u2019s conduct.",

      "The following month, on Aug. 22, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger, officially declared famine in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. For months before that announcement, international humanitarian organizations had warned that the trickle of aid Israel had allowed into the enclave wasn\u2019t nearly enough to feed its population of 2.1 million."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has grown increasingly pessimistic about the chance of brokering an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict any time soon.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has grown increasingly pessimistic about the chance of brokering an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict anytime soon or seeing the leaders of the two warring countries meet in person, according to two senior administration officials.",
      "Trump isn\u2019t abandoning hopes of settling the dispute: He joined a conference call Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, in which he stressed that \u201cEurope must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\u201d a White House official said. Trump also made the point that European leaders must subject China to economic pressure for underwriting the Russian war effort, the official added.",
      "But Trump\u2019s more dour view of reaching a peace deal underscores the distance he has traveled since the 2024 campaign, when he brashly predicted he\u2019d end the war within 24 hours of taking office. (He later said he was speaking \u201cfiguratively.\u201d) Trump has since acknowledged that the war has proved a more stubborn problem than he expected.",
      "Whirlwind peacemaking efforts last month appear to have stalled. Amid expectations of an elusive breakthrough, Trump flew to Anchorage, Alaska, on Aug. 15 for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He touched down in Alaska hoping for a ceasefire and left hours later without one.",
      "Three days later, Trump convened a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy and European leaders. Afterward, he announced that Putin and Zelenskyy would meet for the first time since the war began in February 2022, raising hopes that a rapprochement might be in sight.",
      "That meeting still hasn\u2019t happened, and there\u2019s no sign it will. During a visit to China this week, Putin said he will end the war by force if Ukraine doesn\u2019t agree to his demands. And he said he would meet with Zelenskyy only in Moscow, the Russian capital.",
      "Zelenskyy is willing to meet with Putin in certain Persian Gulf countries, Switzerland, Austria, Turkey and elsewhere \u2014 but not on Putin\u2019s turf, a Ukrainian adviser said.",
      "\u201cWe see nonstop obstacles to peace from Russia\u2019s side and fake arguments from Russia as to why there can\u2019t be a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy in the same room,\u201d Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said in an interview.",
      "Asked whether he had a message for Putin, Trump told reporters at the White House this week: \u201cI have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand, and he\u2019ll make a decision one way or the other. Whatever his decision is, we\u2019ll either be happy about it or unhappy. And if we\u2019re unhappy about it, you\u2019ll see things happen.\u201d",
      "As the peace talks bog down, the casualties continue to mount. Just last week, Russia launched a massive attack on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, that killed at least 15 people, including four children. Since Russia sent tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, casualties on both sides have reached about 1.5 million.",
      "A European source, speaking on condition of anonymity, spoke Thursday about being frustrated that the Trump administration hasn\u2019t imposed meaningful new sanctions on Russia as a prod to end the war.",
      "Leshchenko said, \u201cThe pressure on Putin has to be really harsh so that he will not be able to continue his war machine.\u201d",
      "A complication may be Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin; he has told his advisers that he\u2019s determined not to wreck it, two people briefed on his comments said. Dating to his first term, Trump has said it\u2019s in America\u2019s interest for him to be on civil terms with his Russian counterpart, who presides over a nuclear arsenal.",
      "A potential advantage in retaining a leader-to-leader rapport with Putin is that Trump can position himself as a mediator both sides can trust, a Western official said in an interview. He enjoys leverage with both Putin and Zelenskyy, whose country depends on U.S. arms and money for survival.",
      "In that vein, Trump last month was heard on a hot mic telling French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin wants to make a deal \u201cfor me \u2026 as crazy as it sounds.\u201d",
      "While sanctions are a tool that may wrest concessions from Putin, they carry a downside in that each escalatory twist jeopardizes Trump\u2019s role as a fair broker, the official said. The challenge, the official added, is to adeptly time the sanctions and \u201cdial back\u201d when progress is made.",
      "Another consideration is that sanctions can reverberate in unexpected ways. An administration official pointed to India as a cautionary example. When the United States doubled its tariff rate on India as punishment for buying Russian oil, American relations with India soured. This week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned up in China for an event hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The United States has long seen India as a vital democratic partner in countering Chinese and Russian influence around the world.",
      "Yet in China, Modi was seen holding hands with Putin and speaking warmly to Xi. Images of Modi cozying up to Russia and China, the administration official said, were \u201cnot great.\u201d",
      "Brett Bruen, who was White House director of global engagement in the Obama administration, said in an interview: \u201cWe spent the last decade trying to build up an Indo-Pacific partnership with a view toward limiting the spread of China\u2019s adversarial actions. Trump just took a bazooka to it.\u201d"

      "Emergency officials said all victims were pulled out of the wreckage in just over two hours.",
      "Carris, the company that operates the streetcar, said in a statement Wednesday that \u201call maintenance protocols were carried out and complied with\u201d and that the last repairs were done last year.",
      "But Manuel Leal, the head of the Federation of Transport and Communications Workers\u2019 Unions and the Union of Road and Urban Transport Workers of Portugal, said Wednesday that Carris workers had made \u201crepeated complaints\u201d about the need for maintenance on the funicular carriages, according to the Portuguese state news agency Lusa.",
      "\u201cThere must be an investigation into the root causes of this accident, not least because workers have been reporting for a long time that the maintenance of these carriages should be the responsibility of Carris workers and not outsourced to external companies, as is the case with the Gl\u00f3ria lift,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "France's Macron is hosting Ukraine's Zelenskyy in Paris with hopes he will underwrite \"security guarantees\" in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.",
    "story": [
      "With the United States seemingly content to take a back seat, a high-level meeting in Paris on Thursday will seek to answer the question: Can European powers step up and bring Ukraine and Russia closer to peace?",
      "An actual halt in fighting seems an increasingly distant ambition, with President Donald Trump \u2014 who called into the meeting \u2014 having said that he remained hopeful but that the two sides were clearly \u201cnot ready yet\u201d to make a deal.",
      "\u201cTrump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\" a White House official told NBC News on Thursday after Trump spoke to European leaders. The official added that he also told the leaders they had to \u201cplace economic pressure on China for funding Russia\u2019s war efforts.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday during a visit to Beijing that he will end the war by force if Ukraine does not agree to his demands. He suggested he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but only in Moscow.",
      "With Trump adopting a lesser role after his peace push stalled, European powers hope to plug the diplomatic gap.",
      "They met in Paris early Thursday as part of the informal \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d \u2014 nations that say they are prepared to underwrite the \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d Ukraine says it needs to be confident any future ceasefire would hold.",
      "Hosting the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that after months of planning, \u201cwe are ready as Europeans to offer security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people the day a peace deal is signed.\u201d He declined to offer details, saying they were \u201cextremely confidential.\u201d",
      "The meeting included Zelenskyy, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.",
      "During the meeting, Starmer \u201cemphasized that the group had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with President Trump\u2019s backing, and it was clear they now needed to go even further to apply pressure on Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities,\u201d his office said afterward.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was due to attend, but a technical problem forced his plane to turn around, meaning he will join the summit virtually.",
      "After the meeting, the leaders held a 90-minute phone call with Trump, who has said that he is willing to offer American support as a \u201cbackstop\u201d but that the initiative must be led by the Europeans.",
      "Macron said after the meeting that 26 countries, which he did not name, had agreed to send troops to Ukraine after the war ends.",
      "\u201cWe have today 26 countries that have formally committed \u2014 with several others to clarify their position \u2014 but 26 countries committed to deploy as a reassurance force troops in Ukraine or to be present on the ground, at sea, in air, in order to bring this reassurance to the Ukrainian territory and to Ukraine the day after a ceasefire or peace,\" he said, adding that if Russia refuses peace talks, then additional sanctions would be coordinated with the United States.",
      "Andrii Yermak, Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff, said Thursday that he had met with Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Paris.",
      "The security guarantees \"must be strong and effective\u2014in the air, at sea, and on land,\" he said in a statement. \"The war launched by Russia must be stopped. President Trump\u2019s principle of \u2018peace through strength\u2019 is exactly the kind of approach that can influence the aggressor.\"",
      "For Trump, the war is proving harder to resolve than his onetime claim that he would be able to fix the situation in 24 hours. He has increasingly expressed disappointment and even anger toward Putin but has repeatedly stopped short of imposing new sanctions against Moscow despite numerous threats.",
      "After his push for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy appeared to have fallen apart, Trump conceded Wednesday that there was still a chasm between the two leaders.",
      "\u201cSomething is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has been bombed nightly by Russian missiles and drones and repeatedly said it is ready to call a ceasefire. Russia has rejected that, maintaining it will not do so until Ukraine has fulfilled a set of demands that resemble surrender.",
      "However, Kyiv is still deeply wary of a ceasefire, warning Russia could use it to rearm, regroup and launch other attacks on Ukraine and neighboring countries in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why it and other European powers say the much-vaunted but knotty \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d are essential. They could come in the form of European peacekeeper troops being stationed in Ukraine to uphold the ceasefire, although Russia has summarily rejected that idea so far.",
      "During his high-profile visit to China on Wednesday, Putin gave no signal of shifting from his absolutist demands that Ukraine must surrender and come back into Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "He believes he is winning this conflict, throwing thousands of troops' lives into his war machine each week for grinding battlefield gains.",
      "Putin did say that \u201cif common sense prevails, then it is possible to agree on an acceptable option for ending this conflict,\u201d adding that Trump\u2019s \u201csincere desire to find this solution\u201d meant there is \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d",
      "However, he said, if Ukraine did not accept its demands, \u201cthen we will have to solve all our tasks by force.\u201d"
