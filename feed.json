      "The company said this week that the AI-assisted dubbing \u2013 which refers to the practice of replacing an original audio track with a translated language \u2013 will be offered for licensed titles that previously lacked dubbing, such as the 2003 animated film \u201cEl Cid: La Leyenda.\u201d",
      "The Seattle-based company said its AI-aided dubbing service will be in English and Latin American Spanish. Initially, it will be offered for 12 licensed titles.",
      "Amazon says the program will take a hybrid approach, allowing \u201clocal processionals to collaborate with AI to ensure quality control.\u201d",
      "Other tech companies have also introduced AI-powered dubbing into their platforms. Last year, YouTube released a feature that allows content creators to translate their videos into multiple languages. Meta, meanwhile, said in September that it was testing an AI tool that will automatically translate voices in Reels."

      "NEW YORK -- Green tears were flowing when Lencia Kebede made history this week on Broadway, becoming the first Black actor to assume the role of Elphaba full time in the Broadway company of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",
      "Kebede had already gone through an emotional wringer by the time the curtain finally came down. She sings the Act 1 showstopper \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d shooting into the air and the power of the moment ripped through her.",
      "\u201cWhen the lights went off at the end of the song, I started sobbing. Not like just a gentle tear. Viscerally, I had to release,\u201d she says.",
      "\"I really felt like I was flying, is the simplest way to put it. I felt like I\u2019m doing it myself, though my own power \u2014 my vocal power, my emotional power, the power of all of my African ancestors.\"",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m flying solo/At least I\u2019m flying free/To those who ground me, take a message back from me/Tell them how I am defying gravity,\u201d she sang.",
      "\u201cEveryone deserves a chance to fly,\u201d says Kebede. \u201cI'm projecting this message that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you deserve liberation and you deserve empowerment in the way that the character feels in that moment. It just feels like I\u2019m taking the entire audience in my arms.\u201d",
      "Thank goodness it was intermission. \u201cI needed to regroup,\u201d she says, laughing. \"My makeup artist was like, \u2018Just let it out, just cry, and then we can clean it up.\u2019\u201d",

      "The popularity of the Cynthia Erivo-led movie hasn't dampened the appetite for the Broadway version, which opened in 2003 with songs by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie Holzman. Over Christmas, it took in a staggering $5 million over nine performances, marking the highest weekly gross in history for any Broadway show.",
      "Kebede joins a sisterhood of green-clad Black women who have played Elphaba, a list that includes Saycon Sengbloh and Lilli Cooper, both Broadway standbys; Brandi Chavonne Massey, a Broadway understudy; and Alexia Khadime, a full-time West End Elphaba.",
      "Others who have played the role over the years include Shoshana Bean, Stephanie J. Block, Jessica Vosk, Eden Espinosa, Ana Gasteyer and, of course, Idina Menzel, who won a Tony Award in the role in 2004.",
      "Kebede graduated from Occidental College in 2016 with a double major of diplomacy & world affairs and politics, intending on a career in law or public policy. By her senior year, she had an itch she needed to scratch.",
      "\u201cI just had this creative craving in terms of storytelling in the theatrical way that I was missing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I sat my mother down and I was like, \u2018Look, I think I need just a couple years to explore this creative endeavor.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her first professional job was a production of \u201cMemphis\u201d at Musical Theatre West and then a stint at Tokyo Disney and touring in \u201cRent.\u201d In addition to years on the road with \u201cHamilton,\u201d Kebede also sang backup for Beyonc\u00e9 during her Coachella rehearsals.",
      "\u201cThe rigorous nature of touring, I think, prepared me immensely for this,\u201d she says. \u201cI do feel very equipped \u2014 physically, vocally, emotionally. I feel like I know how to take care of my body and my mind, how I need to cool down emotionally after such an intense experience for three hours.\u201d",
      "On debut night, Kebede tried to keep a set of mental screenshots, a reel of faces and feelings. As she turned to get backstage, she was feeling the love.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother and my father passed when I was in high school and I just took a moment to connect with my angels,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was, oh God, it was electric.\u201d",
      "Family came backstage after the show for photos and a tour, she was toasted at a nearby bar by friends, she finally ate something and then got home to try to sleep.",
      "\u201cMy battery was dead. I mean, I couldn\u2019t even move. I couldn\u2019t move my face. I was just drinking my tea, playing calming jazz. I had to just turn it off,\u201d she says.",
      "And then she had to do it all over again the next night."

      "The main news is that English band The 1975 will headline the main Pyramid Stage on the festival's Friday night, while American singer and actress Olivia Rodrigo will take top billing on the Sunday evening.",
      "Neil Young, the legendary 79-year-old Canadian-American singer-songwriter, was previously announced as the headliner for the Saturday night, while his Scottish peer Rod Stewart had been confirmed for the coveted legends slot on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",

      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranian officials have flogged a popular singer who posted a song online urging women to remove their mandatory headscarves over a conviction for possessing and consuming alcohol, his lawyer and authorities said.",
      "Mehdi Yarahi was flogged on Wednesday, his lawyer Zahra Minuei wrote on the social platform X.",
      "Iran\u2019s semiofficial Fars news agency, quoting an anonymous official, said the sentence was for him drinking and having alcoholic drinks, not his music.",
      "The lashes were \u201cfully carried out in Branch 4 of the Enforcement of Sentences Office at the Tehran Morality Security Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and Mr. Mehdi Yarahi\u2019s case has been closed,\u201d Minuei said.",
      "Yarahi wrote and performed the song \u201cRoosarito,\" Farsi for \u201cYour Headscarf.\" The music video urged women to remove their hijabs and featured uncovered women dancing. Yarahi's initial arrest in August was believed to be linked to the video, which is still available online.",
      "Yarahi wrote on X apparently after the flogging: \u201cHe who is not willing to pay a price for freedom is not worthy of it.\u201d",
      "On the streets of Iranian cities, it\u2019s becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, after the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked in 2022.",
      "Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country\u2019s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities.",
      "The protests that followed Amini\u2019s death started first with the chant \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom.\u201d However, the protesters\u2019 cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. Only Afghanistan and Iran mandate women wearing the hijab.",
      "Meanwhile, online videos showed uncovered women attending the 12th Iran Interior Design Award ceremony, as well as men and women shaking hands. The judiciary's Mizan news agency reported Thursday that prosecutors had announced legal action against all organizers, hosts and individuals seen violating Iran's laws.",

      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music",
      "NEW YORK -- She was the first to go \u201cSOLO.\u201d",
      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music. On Friday, she becomes the latest to drop a debut solo studio album, the English-language \u201cRuby.\u201d It's a kaleidoscope of different sounds for Jennie, full of incongruous, polished pleasures.",
      "\u201cSOLO,\u201d her debut single, was a product of its time \u2013 nostalgic EDM-pop with pitched up whistle effects and simple, declarative lyrics. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo,\" she repeated on the chorus. You had to believe her: She wasn\u2019t leaving her band, but a lackluster relationship, an ex so innocuous they're barely a player in the song. \u201cThis time I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at me, myself and I,\u201d she sang, \u201cI\u2019ma do it on my own now.\u201d A lot has changed in the time since, but the core of her and her band's sonic messaging \u2014 self-empowerment above all else \u2014 hasn't wavered.",
      "On \u201cRuby,\u201d it's strongest on the singles \u201cMantra,\" where Jennie cheerleads in a chant-along chorus: \u201cPretty girls don\u2019t do drama \u2019less we wanna / it\u2019ll be depending on the day\" atop brassy production perfect for primetime commercial placement. Or \u201cExtraL\u201d with the innovative Doechii, whose acicular raps give additional weight to \u201cYeah, we lappin\u2019 the men,\u201d a line delivered with laughter.",
      "But it isn't all assertions of autonomy. On the languid \u201cLove Hangover\u201d with Dominic Fike, she's falling into destructive patterns with an undeserving partner; in a falsetto, her chameleonic vocal performance is so convincing, the recording almost doesn't even sound like Jennie. Or maybe it just doesn't sound like the Jennie fans have grown to known?",
      "Across \u201cRuby,\u201d don\u2019t expect cuts that would make a Blackpink record. Prior to \u201cRuby,\u201d Jennie had only worked with one producer \u2014 Teddy Park, a man synonymous with her girl group hits. This time around, she worked with an eclectic team ranging from Diplo to El Guincho \u2014 new voices to explore different facets of her personality. It's ambitious and glossy, moving from an acoustic ballad here (\u201cTwin\u201d), virtuosic rapping there (\u201cZen\u201d), to familiar beats on (\"With the IE (Way Up)\" and \u201cStart A War\u201d). And it pays off.",
      "Jennie tries her best Rihanna phrasing on the SZA-channeling \u201cStart A War,\" and maybe spends too much time with robust collaborations \u2014 Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis on the nostalgic R&B of \u201cDamn Right,\u201d Dua Lipa on \u201cHandlebars\" that launches straight into the chorus \u2014 perfect for TikTok.",
      "In whole, Jennie's \u201cRuby\u201d is a solid re-introduction to the Blackpink superstar. The songs are strong and diverse and nostalgic \u2014 but maybe not wholly distinctive. It is still a reason to be excited for her future solo work."

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

      "Lady Gaga rediscovered her passion for music through self-discovery, channeling her personal transformation into her new album \u201cMayhem.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Lady Gaga walked into a New York City bar she frequented five years ago, the memories hit hard: Back then, she wrote songs there, feeling lost and disconnected from herself.",
      "But this time was different. While sitting in the bar, Gaga felt a sense of peace and rejuvenation, reminiscent of her teenage years spent scribbling lyrics on napkins.",
      "In recent years, Gaga rediscovered her passion for music by taking a step back from the limelight, cutting ties from fake friendships, swapping the spotlight for quiet nights at home and surrounding herself with people she truly trusts. That personal transformation became the soul of her new album, \u201cMayhem,\u201d which is being released Friday.",
      "\u201cI reclaimed myself as an artist,\u201d said Gaga, a 14-time Grammy and one-time Oscar winner who returned to her dark pop music roots on the album, which spans 14 tracks. Her new project follows last year\u2019s \u201c Harlequin,\u201d a jazz-inspired companion album for the film \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d which stalled at No. 20 on the Billboard 200.",
      "But Gaga's singles for the 14-track \u201cMayhem\u201d have been received well on the charts, including \u201c Disease,\u201d \u201c Abracadabra \u201d and \u201c Die With a Smile,\u201d a collaboration with Bruno Mars, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1 and winning a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance earlier this month.",
      "While recording \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga refused to rest on her past hits or accolades to define her new work. She credited her renewed creative drive to a journey of self-discovery, which ultimately empowered her to step back into the spotlight for several big moments last month. The superstar performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys \u2014 including a tribute song \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\u201d to Los Angeles wildfire victims, closed out the FireAid benefit concert with \u201cAll I Need is Time\u201d and delivered a surprise performance singing \u201cHold My Hand\u201d before the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Next month, Gaga will headline Coachella and perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana Beach in May.",
      "\u201cI built a routine in my daily life around music all the time, and not around self-promotion,\u201d said Gaga, 38, who was a producer and co-executive producer with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Polansky, 41, on \u201cMayhem.\u201d \u201cWhen my life was circulating self-promotion, I think I lost a lot of my passion. When my life was around my family, my partner and my music, it gave me back that realness.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Gaga digs deeper into what it took to regain her passion, showing she's more than just a character and her pulling double duty on \u201cSaturday Night Live\" on Saturday.",
      "While Gaga was dropping early hits like \u201cJust Dance\u201d and \u201cPoker Face,\u201d she noticed critics who downplayed her role in the success, giving more credit to producers and even stylists.",
      "With \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga aimed to showcase that her talent was the true driving force behind her rise. Fueled by the skeptics, the singer is determined to show she's the architect of her success, not just another industry creation.",
      "\u201cThey tried to qualify and quantify me,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often as a woman in music, they say it was other people. You\u2019re a product, like you were made. Something that was really important to me on this was really taking from myself my own inventions.\u201d",
      "When Gaga began recording her new album, she focused on crafting the kind of dark pop melodies that defined her early career, pairing them with lyrics that spoke in code. She said it all came back naturally, giving her reassurance that she was on the right path to fully owning her identity as an artist instead of a made-up character",
      "\u201cThis was a way for me actually to feel like I wasn\u2019t. That it was the real me,\u201d she said. \"I was the creator. This was my work. It was just not a character I was playing. It was something that I made.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, fame came with a price that Gaga wasn't willing to pay. She felt isolated, trapped in transactional relationships and struck in an environment that prioritized competition over creativity.",
      "The spotlight began to feel like an endless race, draining her passion for making music. She began to notice a shift as her sales climbed beyond the first 10 million records.",
      "Gaga realized that staying in that energy would ultimately stifle her creativity, knowing it was time to break free.",
      "\u201cI lost the thing that I would teach my child, which is to sit alone with your thoughts and write a poem,\" Gaga said. \"Sit alone and write a song. Just put good old-fashioned hard work and craftsmanship into what you believe in. I lost that for a long time.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Gaga hit reset. She cut loose draining relationships and building a stable family with Michael Polansky and their beloved dogs.",
      "It helped Gaga channel her energy back into her artistry.",
      "\u201cThis is the first day I\u2019ve done interviews without makeup on, and it\u2019s nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI just get to share with you about my experience with music, and I\u2019m not feeling pressure to perform for you in any other way than as a female artist.\u201d",
      "In her appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Gaga will showcase her range as both the musical guest and host. But her versatility might shine even brighter in the show\u2019s sketch comedy skits.",
      "\u201cI get to work in all different kinds of art that I love so much,\u201d said Gaga, who will make her second appearance as \u201cSNL\u201d host and fifth as its musical guest. The first time she appeared as host and musical guest was in 2013.",
      "Gaga performed during the \u201c SNL50: The Homecoming Concert \u201d last month.",
      "\u201cDoing \u2018SNL\u2019 is all about hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love for the audience on Saturday night because we just want everybody to feel happy at home.\u201d",
      "To prepare, Gaga is synching up with the cast and building rapport, which she says will help balance her roles throughout the night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just be like really close with the cast,\u201d she said. \u201cThey write like all the sketches and they work like all week long on planning, so I feel like the better my relationship is with them and just like getting in there and being one of them, the better the show will be.\u201d",
      "Gaga added: \u201cI\u2019m treating my musical performances separately. I have to wear like a few different hats. There\u2019s hosting and then there\u2019s being the actor in the sketch, and being the artist that I am in my music. I\u2019m ready to do it though.\u201d"

      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens.\u201d",
      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Doja Cat took her front-row seat at Balmain\u2019s fall show at Paris Fashion Week, fresh off her appearance at the Oscars in a custom beaded Balmain gown. But on the runway, designer Olivier Rousteing shifted from red carpet opulence to a new kind of luxury, built on sculptural knitwear, fluid draping and dazzling blown-up zebra motifs.",
      "The Wednesday night collection opened with a now-familiar silhouette from Rousteing \u2014 a swooping hooded sweater, this time paired with a leather peplum and relaxed leather trousers. Knitwear remained the focus \u2014 draped mohair, wool jersey dresses and cocooning sweaters gave the collection a sense of ease.",
      "The monochrome \u201cgroutfit\u201d made a strong showing, broken up by the rich textural play of pleats, ruched tops and embossed leathers that kept the palette from falling flat.",
      "That softness found its counterbalance in statement hardware and a flash of animalistic energy. Chunky bracelets, talon earrings and that bold, graphic zebra motif, paired with oversized coats and slouchy boots reminded us this was still Balmain.",
      "The footwear was a standout. Sculpturally twisted pumps and fuzzy or buttery-soft leather boots injected a playful contrast into the collection\u2019s rhythm of black, white and bursts of citrus orange.",
      "Though the emphasis on draping and ease was a shift, the Balmain DNA shone through in the accessories. Rousteing\u2019s experiment with volume felt like a recalibration rather than a reinvention, proving once again that luxury isn\u2019t just about excess, but knowing when to let the clothes breathe."

      "PARIS -- The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court.",
      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77",
      "EDINA, Minn. -- Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Molland was the last to join and had been the last survivor from the most famous lineup of the group, which recorded for the Beatles \u2019 Apple label. His death was confirmed Tuesday by Sam Sheffield-West, the funeral director at Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels in Edina, Minnesota. Molland had lived in the state for decades. Additional details about his death weren't immediately available.",
      "Badfinger was a quartet that also included singer-guitarist Pete Ham, bassist Tom Evans and drummer Tom Gibbins. They were among the first acts signed to Apple after the Beatles launched it in 1968 and would remain closely associated with the Beatles \u2014 not always to Badfinger's liking \u2014 throughout their brief years of success. Molland even grew up near Liverpool's Penny Lane, immortalized in the Beatles song of the same name.",
      "Badfinger's breakout hit, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d was written and produced by Paul McCartney, and another top 10 single, \u201cDay After Day,\u201d was produced by George Harrison and featured Harrison's slide guitar. \u201cNo Matter What\u201d was produced by Apple official/Beatles assistant Mal Evans, and another Badfinger song, \u201cWithout You,\u201d became a hit for Beatles friend Harry Nilsson. Molland and his bandmates would also appear at Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for Bangladesh and provide backing on two Beatles member's solo albums: Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d and John Lennon's \u201cImagine.\u201d",
      "Critics could not stop likening Badfinger's catchy melodies, layered harmonies and tight arrangements to their benefactors: \u201cIt\u2019s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger,\" Rolling Stone wrote of them in 1970. Even the band's name originated from the Beatles. Badfinger had called itself the Ivies in the years preceding their joining Apple, but, at the suggestion of Apple official/Beatles assistant Neil Aspinall, agreed to change it to Badfinger. (The working title of the Beatles' \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends\u201d was \u201cBad Finger Boogie\u201d).",
      "Their time on top ended after 1972. Amid cutbacks at Apple and allegations of financial mismanagement, Badfinger left for Warner Bros., faded commercially and sustained a tragic loss when Ham took his life in 1975. After initially breaking up, the remaining members periodically reunited but never approached their early success.",
      "Evans took his own life in 1983 and Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005.",
      "Molland remained active well after Badfinger's prime, touring until his health began to fail last year and releasing such solo albums as \u201cThis Way Up\u201d \u201cAfter the Pearl\u201d and \u201cBe True To Yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was raised to go to work \u2014 to get up in the morning and go to work,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2001.",

      "Dr. Marty Makary will answer questions from a Senate panel about his plans to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",
      "\u2014 Pressure from anti-abortion groups to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone",
      "\u2014 Efforts to keep up with a wave of artificial intelligence-based medical systems",
      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the new measure",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "The Trump administration is dropping an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of the administration\u2019s first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump's second term began",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.",
      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",
      "He was credited with saving the lives of 2.4 million babies through his plasma donations, the national agency responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, also known as Lifeblood, said in a statement.",
      "Lifeblood chief executive Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.",
      "\u201cJames was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\u201d Cornelissen said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt was James\u2019 belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\u201d Cornelissen added.",
      "Mellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison\u2019s daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.",
      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "There is speculation that Harrison developed a high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.",
      "\u201cAfter the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you\u2019re only really alive because people donated blood,\u201d Jarrod Mellowship said. \u201cThe day he turned 18, he started donating.\u201d",
      "The application of anti-D in fighting hemolytic disease of the newborn was not discovered until the 1960s.",
      "Harrison, who was born in New South Wales, is survived by his sister, Margaret Thrift, his daughter, two grandsons and four great-grandchildren."

      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- A security guard at an Arizona hospital was shot and wounded over the weekend, and the man suspected in the attack was quickly disarmed and taken into custody, authorities say.",
      "The security guard was shot around 1 p.m. Sunday inside the emergency room at HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center, Scottsdale Police said in a news release.",
      "The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents of increasing violence against U.S. healthcare workers and highlighted the challenges of protecting them.",
      "The 30-year-old suspect was disarmed and detained by other members of the security team and staff before arriving officers arrested him, police said.",
      "Police on Monday identified the suspect as Maximillian Yanofsky. He was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on multiple charges including aggravated assault, police said.",
      "Efforts to contact a lawyer for Yanofsky on Monday weren't immediately successful.",
      "The security guard was taken to a trauma center for a higher level of care and remained hospitalized Monday, police said. A different security guard was injured in the hand and wrist during the incident, police said.",
      "Police said Yanofsky had been taken to HonorHealth Shea earlier in the day as a potential patient.",
      "No reason for the shooting was given. Police said officers were called about a disturbance in the emergency room that escalated to an altercation with security. Police said that during the altercation, Yanofsky took out a gun and shot the guard once in the upper body.",
      "Late last month, a man carrying a pistol and zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",
      "\u201cThe government needs to give us more tools so we can protect ourselves,\u201d she said.",

      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",

      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",
      "\u201cWhen I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,\" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.",
      "With Whitetop\u2019s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, \u201cStill Spit\u2019n.\u201d The proceeds go to the camp.",
      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",

      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",

      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",

      "Yet \u201call the people out there who have, you know, sick parents, sick children, this is going to impact,\u201d said neuroscientist Richard Huganir of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The administration\u2019s unprecedented moves are upending the research engine that has made the U.S. \u201cthe envy of the world in terms of scientific innovation,\u201d said Georgetown University health policy expert Lawrence Gostin.",

      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",

      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%.

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

Increase the heat to medium-high, bring the liquid to a full boil, and then decrease the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth has thickened and the greens are meltingly tender and have turned from bright green to a muted olive color, 30\u201345 minutes (if you\u2019re using hardier greens like collards, they will take a bit longer to cook, while softer varieties like baby spinach will cook quickly).",
      "Stir in the reserved sausage, cover and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and black pepper, then ladle into soup bowls. Top each bowl with a scoop of rice and a lemon wedge and serve hot."

    "story": [
      "There's a mid-March deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, and hesitation is surfacing among congressional Republicans about potential cuts to Medicaid",
      "WASHINGTON -- Every time a baby is born in Louisiana, where Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson handily won reelection last year, there\u2019s more than a 60% chance taxpayers will finance the birth through Medicaid.",
      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",

      "Passing of the new laws has spurred fears of incidents between rival Serb and central Bosnian police forces.",

      "Japan\u2019s top court has found two former company executives not guilty of negligence over the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster and the subsequent deaths of dozens of elderly residents during their forced evacuation",
      "Japan's top court has found two former company executives not guilty of negligence over the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster and the subsequent deaths of dozens of elderly residents during their forced evacuation.",
      "The Supreme Court, upholding earlier lower court decisions that had acquitted the three top officials of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, said that a tsunami of the size that hit the plant was unforeseeable and the executives could not be held accountable for negligence.",
      "The ruling rejected an appeal by the prosecution seeking their criminal responsibility, and the acquittal of two executives - Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro - is now final. The charges against a third executive, former TEPCO chairperson Tsunehisa Katsumata, was dropped following his death in October.",
      "The case was the only criminal trial related to the nuclear accident, in which a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and massive tsunami hit the plant, destroying its cooling systems and causing three reactors to melt. A large amount of radiation was released into surrounding soil and the sea, causing tens of thousands of residents to lose their homes, jobs and community ties.",
      "The defendants were charged by a civil prosecution panel after the public prosecutors had dropped the case. The civil prosecution side that included Fukushima residents argued that TEPCO could have prevented the disaster had the plant installed sufficient safety measures before the tsunami, based on a long-term tsunami assessment provided by experts.",
      "Ruiko Muto, who headed the prosecution side, called the ruling that came out just days ahead of the 14th anniversary of the accident \u201ccold blooded\u201d and one that tramples on the victims of the nuclear disaster.",
      "The court said the executives were not guilty of causing the deaths of 44 elderly patients whose already waning health deteriorated during or after forced evacuations from a local hospital and a nursing home.",
      "The ruling said the 2002 long-term projection was not considered as reliable and that it was impossible for TEPCO officials to predict the tsunami of that magnitude based on that."

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia targeted Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure in a large-scale missile and drone bombardment during the night, officials said Friday, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said talks with the U.S. on ending the 3-year war will take place next week.",
      "Ukraine came under a \u201cmassive missile and drone\u201d attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were injured, authorities said.",
      "\u201cRussia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,\u201d Halushchenko wrote.",
      "Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine\u2019s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of \u201cweaponizing winter\u201d in an effort to erode civilian morale.",
      "Russia fired 67 missiles from air, land and sea and launched 194 strike and decoy drones, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Their primary target was Ukraine\u2019s natural gas extraction facilities, it said.",
      "For the first time, Ukraine deployed French Mirage-2000 warplanes delivered a month ago to help repel the attack, according to the air force. Ukraine also has Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets to shoot down Russian missiles.",
      "Ukrainian defenses downed 34 missiles and 100 drones, the air force said, while up to 10 missiles didn\u2019t reach their targets and 86 drones were lost from radars, presumably jammed by electronic warfare.",
      "Western-supplied air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine\u2019s fight but further U.S. help is uncertain under U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he is determined to end the war and has paused American military aid for Kyiv as a way of pressuring Zelenskyy to negotiate.",
      "In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet the country\u2019s crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed a European Union plan to bolster the continent\u2019s defenses. He expressed hope that some of the new spending could be used to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s own defense industry.",

      "\u201cI think between availability and the time that people have to queue to get sandbags, they\u2019re just making the easier choice and grabbing potting mix,\u201d Effeney said, adding one customer bought 30 bags from his store at Samford on Brisbane\u2019s northwest fringe.",
      "Several Brisbane sandbag collection points were either empty or people had to line up for hours to collect available sandbags. A beach volleyball business complained that some of its sand had been stolen to fill bags.",

      "Tens of millions of Pakistanis tune into homegrown soap operas every night, but they are also a hit in India",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- Two Pakistani women sit together on a couch, rehearsing their lines while a director scrutinizes them. Waiting off camera for his scene is the male lead, an actor blessed with \u201cBachelor\u201d hair and fine bone structure.",
      "Also out of sight: the Islamabad homeowners, who are holed up in a separate room and whose furniture and knick-knacks will be seen by millions of viewers \u2014 many from the society that has been their country's neighbor and uneasy sparring partner for much of the past century.",
      "This is the set of the Pakistani drama \u201cAdhi Bewafai,\u201d or \u201cHalf Infidelity\u201d \u2014 one of what some in other nations would call \u201csoap operas.\" But these dramas, it turns out, are not just for Pakistanis.",
      "Realistic settings, natural dialogue and almost workaday plots about families and marriages make Pakistani dramas a hit with viewers at home and abroad \u2014 especially in the neighboring country that split with Pakistan in 1947 and is its nuclear archrival today: India.",
      "Television, it seems, is succeeding where diplomacy sometimes can't.",
      "Several thousand people work in Pakistan\u2019s drama industry; the country produces between 80 to 120 shows a year, each one a source of escapism and intrigue. They offer Indians a tantalizing glimpse into life across the border \u2014 and manage to break through decades of enmity between the two governments.",
      "Maheen Shafeeq, a research associate at the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, says there is effectively no relationship between the two governments. Each government is fixed on a single issue it cannot move past \u2014 for India, it\u2019s terrorism; for Pakistan, the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. \u201cThe governments are very much opposed to each other,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t agree what they should talk about.\u201d",
      "Although it\u2019s difficult for Indians to visit Pakistan, where these shows are filmed, they faithfully follow the plot twists and turns through platforms like YouTube, ZEE5, and MX Player.",
      "For those of a certain generation, however, it wasn\u2019t always so easy to keep up.",
      "Kaveri Sharma, a writer in the Indian city of Patna, recalls her mother-in-law and aunt jiggling antennas in the 1980s and 1990s in hopes of catching a signal from Pakistan\u2019s state broadcaster, PTV. It\u2019s how Sharma first realized that the country next door was a drama powerhouse. It inspired her to discover the shows for herself years later, even going on to watch them with her own daughter.",
      "\u201cThey feel familiar, but they are also a break from our own lives,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cI don\u2019t see any differences between the two countries. Everything is relatable. I see Karachi and think that it could be Lucknow or Patna. What happens on the shows could happen to me or my friends.\u201d",
      "She had heard only negative things about Pakistan since childhood \u2014 that it was the enemy that would take everything from India. The TV dramas have added subtlety and detail to this image for her. She would love to visit, but is unlikely to get the opportunity. So she explores Pakistan through the locations, malls, offices, streets and restaurants depicted on the small screen. The names of popular Karachi neighborhoods roll off her tongue.",
      "Sharma, like Bibi Hafeez in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad and Punita Kumar in the central Indian city of Raipur, raves about the dramas\u2019 universality of themes, the strong characterization and the emotional range.",
      "\u201cPakistani characters are not only heroes or villains. They have shades to them, and that is very human,\u201d says Kumar, who chanced upon a Pakistani drama through a chunky videocassette when she was a teenager living in the northern Indian city of Aligarh. It was love at first watch.",
      "\u201cThey captivated me. We got a cable connection that offered PTV. Then YouTube came and I realized I could search for whatever drama I wanted. I haven\u2019t taken a stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get exposure to Pakistani life in the scenes, but the struggles the characters have with their relatives are ones I would have with my own.\u201d",
      "Pakistani TV veteran Khaled Anam is delighted by Indians\u2019 enthusiasm for the country\u2019s serials and the barriers they help erode.",
      "\u201cWhat Bollywood is to India, dramas are to Pakistan,\u201d says Anam, who is based in Karachi and has worked as an actor since the 1980s. He has appeared in many dramas, including the ratings smash \u201cHumsafar\u201d (\u201cLife Partner\u201d).",
      "India dominates the movie market in South Asia and beyond, with big stars and bigger budgets. Pakistanis have been exposed to Bollywood films for decades, although the prevailing hostile political climate means they can't watch them in movie theaters. The bans are mutual, though. India, like Pakistan, restricts content from across the border in movie theaters and TV channels.",
      "And while India is no slouch when it comes to TV production, it doesn\u2019t offer viewers what Pakistan does, according to Anam: simplicity, depth of writing and a limited number of episodes.",
      "\u201cThere are 15-minute flashbacks in Indian serials. (The characters) are decked out and dolled up. It\u2019s a fantasy world. The shows go on forever. Everything is \u2018DUN dun dun!\u2019\u201d says Anam, mimicking a dramatic musical riff and shaking his hands.",
      "The actors on the couch in Islamabad are rehearsing lines about a woman who is disrespectful and so, according to one of them, is an unsuitable marriage prospect. The delivery and grammar could be heard in virtually any South Asian household.",
      "\u201cPakistanis are generally emotional people, and that is in their dramas also,\u201d says Islamabad-based director Saife Hassan. \u201cIt would take me less than two minutes to explain the plot of the super-duper hit \u2018Kabhi Main, Kabhi Tum\u2019 (\u2018Sometimes Me, Sometimes You\u2019). It\u2019s about the emotions between a husband and wife.\u201d",
      "Hassan, who began his TV career in the 1990s, says Indians frequently comment on his social media pages and send him direct messages about his work. He even recalls Indian viewers praying for the recovery of a character who was in a coma.",
      "Hassan would love to see more homegrown dramas make it onto platforms like Netflix, as some Indian shows have with great success. But he wonders whether international audiences would understand and connect with Pakistani stories or lives: \u201cThe way we think is different from the West. Our shows are not driven by events. They are driven by emotions.\u201d",
      "There is also a lack of raunch in Pakistani dramas, which are family-friendly with little to no vulgarity, violence, or even action. Indians, therefore, are a natural audience for Pakistani dramas, Hassan says.",
      "\u201cThey are our people. They are like us. They eat like us,\u201d he says. \u201cI love India, and I love Indians. They have grown out of this animosity.\u201d",

      "European Union leaders committed to working together to bolster the continent\u2019s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders on Thursday committed to working together to bolster the continent's defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated warnings that he would cut them adrift to face the threat of Russia alone.",
      "With the growing conviction that they will now have to fend for themselves, countries that have faltered on defense spending for decades held emergency talks in Brussels to explore new ways to beef up their security and ensure future protection for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cToday history is being written,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters after the summit ended.",
      "She said the 27 EU leaders are \u201cdetermined to ensure Europe\u2019s security and to act with the scale, the speed and the resolve that this situation demands. We are determined to invest more, to invest better and to invest faster together.\u201d",
      "The pledge underscored a sea change in geopolitics spurred on by Trump, who has undermined 80 years of cooperation based on the understanding that the U.S. would help protect European nations following World War II.",
      "The leaders signed off on a move to loosen budget restrictions so that willing EU countries can increase their military spending. They also urged the European Commission to seek new ways \u201cto facilitate significant defense spending\" in all member states, a statement said.",
      "The EU\u2019s executive branch estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way.",
      "The leaders also took note of a commission offer of loans worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion) to buy new military equipment and invited EU headquarters staff \u201cto examine this proposal as a matter of urgency.\u201d",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a staunch supporter of Trump and considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in Europe, refused to endorse part of the summit statement in favor of Ukraine.",
      "But the 26 other EU leaders approved the bloc\u2019s stance that there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine and that the Europeans must be involved in any talks involving their security. The Europeans have so far been sidelined in the U.S.-led negotiations with Russia.",
      "In other developments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said talks between Ukraine and the U.S. on ending the war will take place in Saudi Arabia next week. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet the country's crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials.",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has overturned old certainties about the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner as he embraces Russia, withdraws American support for Ukraine and upends the tradition of cooperation with Europe that has been the bedrock of Western security for generations.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said that three years of war in Ukraine and a shift in attitudes in Washington \u201cpose entirely new challenges for us, and Europe must take up this challenge ... and it must win.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will arm ourselves faster, smarter and more efficiently than Russia,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the plan to loosen budget rules and expressed hopes that some of the new spending could be used to strengthen Ukraine's own defense industry, which can produce weapons more cheaply than elsewhere in Europe and closer to the battlefields where they are needed.",
      "\"We are very thankful that we are not alone, and these are not just words. We feel it. It\u2019s very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said, looking far more relaxed among Europe's leaders in Brussels than almost a week ago when he received a verbal lashing from Trump in Washington.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, and summit chairman Antonio Costa discussed ways to fortify Europe's defenses on a short deadline. Merz pushed plans this week to loosen his nation\u2019s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending.",
      "Others too appeared ready to do more.",
      "\u201cSpend, spend, spend on defense and deterrence. That\u2019s the most important message,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters.",
      "The call is a sharp departure from decades of decline in military spending in Europe, where defense often ranked low in many budgetary considerations after the Cold War.",
      "In an address to his country Wednesday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said the bloc would \u201ctake decisive steps.\"",
      "\u201cMember states will be able to increase their military spending,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cmassive joint funding will be provided to buy and produce some of the most innovative munitions, tanks, weapons and equipment in Europe.\u201d",
      "Macron conferred with his EU counterparts about the possibility of using France\u2019s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats.",
      "The short-term benefits of the budget plan offered by von der Leyen were not obvious. Most of the increased defense spending would have to come from national budgets at a time when many countries are already overburdened with debt.",
      "Part of the proposal includes measures to ensure struggling member states will not be punished for going too deep into the red if additional spending is earmarked for defense.",
      "\u201cEurope faces a clear and present danger, and therefore Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself,\u201d she said.",
      "France is struggling to reduce an excessive annual budget deficit of 5% of GDP, after running up its total debt burden to 112% of GDP with spending on relief for businesses and consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Five other countries using the euro currency have debt levels over 100% of GDP: Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal.",
      "Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany, has more room to borrow, with a debt level of 62% of GDP.",
      "Part of any security plan would be to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian attacks such as the one that hit Zelenskyy's hometown overnight.",
      "A Russian missile killed four people staying at a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, shortly after volunteers from a humanitarian organization moved in. The volunteers included Ukrainian, American and British nationals, but it wasn't clear whether those people were among the 31 who were wounded.",
      "Early this week, Trump ordered a pause in U.S. military supplies being sent to Ukraine as he sought to press Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia. The move brought fresh urgency to Thursday's summit.",
      "But the meeting in Brussels did not address Ukraine\u2019s most pressing needs. It was not aimed at drumming up more arms and ammunition to fill any supply vacuum created by the U.S. freeze. Nor will all nations agree to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized.",

      "Premier Giorgia Meloni on Friday slammed the court decision as \u201cquestionable\u201d and \u201cfrustrating.\u201d",
      "The Cassation court ruling, which overturns a previous one, ordered the Italian government to pay for damages inflicted to the migrants at the time of the standoff. Judges late on Thursday sent the case back to an ordinary court, asking it to define the exact amount of compensation to be granted.",
      "A group of Eritrean migrants appealed to the Cassation court over the ordeal of 190 migrants by Italy\u2019s Diciotti coast guard ship in August 2018. Thirteen migrants with health problems were first disembarked on Lampedusa island off Italy\u2019s southern tip. The ship then headed to Catania in Sicily, but was blocked for about 10 days by Salvini\u2019s orders, before the remaining 177 migrants were allowed off.",
      "Meloni, who leads a conservative coalition including hardline League leader and vice-premier Salvini, said the decision won\u2019t help \u201ccitizens getting closer to institutions.\u201d",
      "\u201cDue to this decision, the government will need to pay compensation \u2014 using money from honest Italian citizens who pay taxes \u2013 to people who tried to enter Italy illegally, violating the Italian law,\u201d she wrote in a social media post.",
      "Salvini, in a separate post, called the ruling \u201cabsurd,\u201d urging the magistrates to use their own money if they really want to compensate their \u201cbeloved migrants.\u201d He has always said that his job was to defend Italy\u2019s borders.",
      "It was the latest chapter of a months-long clash between the Italian magistrates and the Meloni government, which is trying to push forward a radical reform of the judiciary system. Many critics say it puts the judiciary's independence at risk.",
      "Italian courts have also been challenging Meloni\u2019s flagship initiative to transfer migrants to costly reception centers built in Albania for fast-track processing."

      "The International Court of Justice said in a statement that Sudan\u2019s case, filed Wednesday, concerns acts allegedly perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias including \u201cgenocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violation of human rights\u201d targeting the Masalit people.",
      "Sudan alleges that the UAE was \u201ccomplicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia,\u201d the court said.",
      "The United Arab Emirates did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sudan also asked the court to impose urgent interim orders known as provisional measures on the UAE, including doing all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit.",
      "Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary rebels broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions.",
      "The war has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people \u2014 about 30% of the population \u2014 from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.",
      "The case at the world court was announced less than two weeks after the Rapid Support Forces and its allies signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government, following recent advances by Sudan\u2019s army against the rival groups.",
      "The group Conflict Observatory, which is funded by the U.S. State Department and has been monitoring the war in Sudan, has identified aircraft it says carried UAE arms transfers to the RSF. Those flights went through A\u00e9roport International Mar\u00e9chal Idriss Deby in Amdjarass, Chad \u2014 flights the UAE has claimed have been for supporting a local hospital.",
      "In January, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan. That came as the U.S. declared the RSF are committing genocide.",
      "The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a U.S. ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it has strenuously denied despite evidence to the contrary.",
      "Two decades ago, the Sudanese region of Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.",
      "Rulings by the International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, take years to reach and are legally binding.",

      "European Union leaders on Friday downplayed skepticism from U.S. President Donald Trump about solidarity among NATO members",
      "MADRID -- European Union leaders on Friday downplayed skepticism from U.S. President Donald Trump about solidarity among NATO members a day after they backed plans to spend more on defense amid wavering U.S. support.",
      "After European leaders committed Thursday to freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security, Trump said he was \u201cnot so sure\u201d that the military alliance would come to the United States\u2019 defense if the country were attacked.",
      "\u201cWe are loyal and faithful allies,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said late Thursday in response, expressing \u201crespect and friendship\u201d toward U.S. leaders and adding that France was \u201centitled to expect the same.\u201d",
      "M\u0101ris Riekstins, Latvia\u2019s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country \u2014 which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia \u2014 to defense spending.",
      "The Baltic country last month said spending should be increased to 4% of GDP next year and move toward 5%.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated warnings that he would make European allies face the threat of Russia alone has spurred countries that for decades faltered on defense spending to find ways to bolster their security and back Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
      "On Thursday, EU leaders signed off on a move to loosen budget restrictions so that willing EU countries could increase their military spending.",
      "Following the emergency talks in Brussels, Trump again suggested that the U.S. could abandon its NATO commitments if member countries didn\u2019t meet the alliance\u2019s defense spending targets. He expressed doubt that other allies will come to the defense of the U.S. \u2014 though they have done so after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the only instance in which the Article 5 mutual defense guarantee was invoked.",
      "The U.S. president has criticized the alliance for years, arguing that European members have not contributed enough toward their own security.",
      "In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO\u2019s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy \u2014 and NATO laggard \u2014 would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target.",
      "Spain spent an estimated 1.28% of GDP on defense last year. Italy and Belgium also spent less than the 2% target last year, according to NATO estimates.",
      "NATO members pledged in 2014 to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, which 23 countries were expected to meet last year amid concerns about the war in Ukraine. Spain, which ranked last among NATO members for the share of GDP it contributed to the military, previously said it would reach that target by 2029.",
      "S\u00e1nchez emphasized Spain\u2019s commitment to European security and to backing Ukraine \u2014 though he stated that the security threats faced by the southern European nation were of a different nature than what European allies on the bloc\u2019s eastern front face from Russia.",
      "Still, he said, \u201cit\u2019s clear that we all have to make an effort and an accelerated effort.\u201d",
      "Though he did not name Trump, the Spanish leader on Thursday argued for a stronger, more unified Europe, saying that \u201cwhile some (leaders) raise walls and tariffs, we build bridges and close trade agreements.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made comments that appeared to backtrack on previous support for Ukraine joining NATO. She argued that extending the alliance's mutual defense guarantees to Ukraine without granting it membership would ensure \"stable, lasting and effective security.\u201d",
      "Sweden on Friday marked its first anniversary as a member of NATO, with posts on social platform X from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.",
      "Neither mentioned Trump\u2019s comments but focused on \u201ca more secure Sweden and a stronger NATO.\u201d",

      "JERUSALEM -- The Trump administration\u2019s cuts to USAID have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in contractual payments to aid groups, leaving them paying out of pocket to preserve a fragile ceasefire, according to officials from the U.S. humanitarian agency.",
      "The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement.",
      "USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials.",
      "But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.",
      "Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. They said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely.",
      "Some organizations have already reported laying off workers and scaling down operations, according to internal USAID information shared with the AP.",
      "That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian assistance.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. established very specific, concrete commitments for aid delivery under the ceasefire, and there is no way ... to fulfill those as long as the funding freeze is in place,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former USAID official.",
      "USAID has been one of the biggest targets of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Before Trump took office, USAID had roughly $446 million to disperse to partner organizations in Gaza in 2025, the USAID officials said.",
      "But after Trump froze global foreign assistance, USAID\u2019s Gaza team had to submit a waiver to ensure the funds for Gaza aid could continue to flow. They received approval Jan. 31 to secure over $383 million in funding, less than two weeks after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire was reached.",
      "Some $40 million was subsequently cut under a measure that no money be provided for aid in the form of direct cash assistance.",
      "USAID then signed contracts with eight partner organizations, including prominent NGOs and U.N. agencies, awarding them money to flood supplies and services into Gaza. Then, the officials said, they began hearing that organizations were not receiving the promised payments \u2014 even as they had already spent millions, expecting USAID reimbursement.",
      "Some of those organizations are now spending less and scaling back programs.",
      "The International Medical Corps, a global nonprofit that provides medical and development assistance, was awarded $12 million to continue operations at two hospitals in Gaza. These include the largest field hospital in Gaza, whose construction was funded by USAID at the request of the Israeli government, according to internal USAID information.",
      "It has now requested payback of over $1 million, said one USAID official, adding that the freeze has forced the organization to lay off some 700 staff members and offer only basic services at the hospitals, with a skeletal crew.",
      "A former IMC staffer, who quit citing lack of stability, said the program providing life-saving treatment for malnutrition was almost frozen for lack of funds. The former staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the organization\u2019s details, said the current nutrition services were at a minimum level.",
      "Meanwhile, termination letters severing the contracts between USAID and Gaza partners were also sent out to organizations that were major providers of shelter, child protection and logistical support in the Gaza aid operation, a USAID official said.",
      "Some of the termination letters seen by the AP were signed by new USAID deputy chief Peter Marocco \u2014 a returning political appointee from Trump\u2019s first term. They instruct organizations to \u201cimmediately cease\u201d all activities and \u201cavoid additional spending chargeable to the award,\u201d citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In addition to the spending freeze, officials say USAID has been wracked by internal chaos and the introduction of arbitrary regulations since the new administration took office.",
      "During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Israel had to allow at least 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, as well as 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents.",
      "Two USAID officials said the agency was originally supposed to buy 400 temporary homes that would make it into Gaza by the end of Phase 1 of the deal, and over 5,200 more during the next phase. That figure has since been slashed to just over 1,000.",
      "USAID was never able to purchase the mobile homes because of newly-imposed policies requiring extra approvals for procurements.",
      "On Feb. 2, some 40% of the Gaza team was locked out of their email accounts and software necessary to track awards, move payments and communicate with the organizations. An email sent immediately following the lockout came from Gavin Kliger, a DOGE staffer.",
      "Access to the servers has now been restored, the officials said, but the team is smaller after waves of layoffs. From an original team of about 30 people, only six or seven remain.",
      "Very few mobile homes entered Gaza during Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which ended last week, prompting Hamas to accuse Israel of violating the truce.",
      "Israel has cut off all aid shipments into Gaza in a bid to pressure Hamas to accept an extension of the ceasefire. That has sent aid groups scrambling to distribute reserves of food and shelter to the most needy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is considering cutting off electricity to raise the pressure on Hamas.",
      "With USAID in flux, the U.S. risks losing its influence, said Dave Harden, the former USAID assistant administrator of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Aid and a longtime director of the agency\u2019s work in the Palestinian territories.",
      "\u201cU.S. aid assistance to Palestinians ... never, ever equated to U.S. assistance to Israel, never quite balanced, but always gave us a seat at the table, always helped us to have real discussions with both the Palestinians and the Israelis about what the future might hold,\u201d Harden said.",
      "Now, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re just simply not at the table in a meaningful way, and so I think the ceasefire is fragile.\u201d",

      "Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going.",
      "But the same factors that have pulled mortgage rates to their lowest level since December \u2014 signs that the U.S. economy is slowing and uncertainty over the potential fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports \u2014 are clouding the outlook for where mortgage rates will go from here.",
      "\u201cWe do not anticipate significant relief from high mortgage rates in the near future because of inflation remaining stubbornly high, which will not be helped by the tariffs that the Trump administration appears committed to rolling out,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. has declined six weeks in a row from 7.04% in mid-January to 6.76% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year earlier, it averaged 6.94%.",
      "The average rate is now at its lowest level since Dec. 19, when it was 6.72%. It briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but remains more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates echoes moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 4.79% in mid-January, has been mostly easing since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the potential impact from the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on several of the country's biggest trading partners.",
      "While one could say the bond market jitters have ultimately benefited home shoppers by leading to lower mortgage rates, the trajectory for rates from here is far from certain.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "And then there\u2019s the Fed, which has signaled a more cautious approach as it gauges where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue.",
      "So far, the steady decline in mortgage rates this year hasn\u2019t been enough to drive home sales higher. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in January as rising mortgage rates and prices froze out many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "Pending home sales, a bellwether for future completed sales, point to potentially further sales declines in coming months. They slid to an all-time low in January.",
      "Still, last week, mortgage applications jumped 20.4% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And a measure of home loan refinancing applications surged 37%, the MBA said.",
      "While a pickup in mortgage applications is typical for this time of year, the sharp increase is a signal that mortgage rates have fallen enough to spur some buyers off the fence.",
      "The pullback in rates comes at a good time for home shoppers. The inventory of homes on the market has risen sharply from a year ago and prices are rising more slowly nationally and declining in many metropolitan areas, such as Austin, Dallas and Tampa, Florida.",
      "Still, more attractive mortgage rates may not be enough to motivate home shoppers if the economy and labor market worsen.",
      "\u201cInflation is still a problem, but now the economy is starting to show signs of weakness,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cWhat that means to the housing market is that those two factors make buyers more reluctant to jump into the market.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 is baffling businesses and causing them to delay or cancel the investments that help drive economic growth",
      "WASHINGTON -- Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois is getting ready to introduce a fancy ergonomic chair designed to reduce customers\u2019 back pain and boost their productivity. He figures the most expensive one will sell for more than $1,000. But he can\u2019t settle on a price, and he is reluctantly reducing the shipment he\u2019s bringing to the United States from China.",
      "There\u2019s a reason for his caution: President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "The latest reversal came Thursday. Two days after imposing 25% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on all imports from Canada and Mexico and threatening to detonate more than $1.3 billion in annual U.S. trade in North America, Trump announced that he was suspending many of the levies on Mexico and some of them on Canada for a month. This was an expansion of his Wednesday announcement when he exempted auto imports from both countries for 30 days, and it also comes after a previous monthlong tariff reprieve for Canada and Mexico right before they were to take effect Feb. 4.",
      "\u201cTrump is jerking around the entire continent of North America right now, it\u2019s stupid and it has to stop,\" Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said. \"Today there are businesses that don\u2019t even know if the goods they trade in are subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Everything Trump does on trade seems designed to maximize chaos and uncertainty.",
      "Rosenberg and his ergonomic furniture, meanwhile, are contending with a 20% tariff on imports from China \u2013 which Trump on Tuesday raised from 10% -- but he\u2019s not sure where the tariff will actually land.",
      "\u201cThe misdirection is making it very tough to plan for the year,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they\u2019re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also draw retaliation from trading partners, which can hurt all economies involved.",
      "But import taxes can cause economic damage in another way: by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories, what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.",
      "\u201cIt creates an enormous amount of uncertainty for multinational companies that sell products worldwide, that import from the rest of the world, that run these complex supply chains through multiple countries,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. \u201cThe uncertainty is going to be very unsettling for businesses and ... it will hurt business investment.''",
      "During Trump\u2019s first-term trade battles, U.S. business investment weakened late in 2019, convincing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in second half of the year to provide some offsetting economic stimulus.",
      "Trump 2.0 is even more unnerving to business. The first Trump administration imposed tariffs on specific targets \u2014 steel and aluminum and most goods from China \u2014 after lengthy investigations.",
      "This time, Trump has invoked his power to declare a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants across U.S. borders \u2014 to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China with the stroke of a pen. And he\u2019s expanded his targets. Next month, for example, he intends to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u2019\u2019 on countries that charge higher import taxes than America does.",
      "\u201cJust the threat of those tariff increases and potential retaliations are putting a brake on \u2014 on investment, on consumption decisions, on employment, hiring, all the rest of it,\u2019\u2019 European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said after the ECB cut interest rates Thursday to support Europe\u2019s struggling economy.",
      "His tariffs on Canada and Mexico effectively blow up a 2020 North American trade deal he negotiated himself five years ago. \u201cPast trade agreements simply don\u2019t mean much if the president can unilaterally violate them and impose tariffs with no checks at all,\u201d said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty: It\u2019s unclear what Trump is trying to achieve by plastering tariffs on American trading partners. Sometimes he cites border security. Sometimes he emphasizes the revenue that tariffs can generate for the Treasury \u2014 money that can help finance his proposed tax cuts. Sometimes he points to America\u2019s big trade deficits with most other countries.",
      "Since the goals are cloudy, it\u2019s hard to see what it will take to make Trump\u2019s tariffs go away.",
      "Not only that, but he\u2019s imposed the tariffs erratically, creating even more confusion. For instance, his administration had to reverse itself last month after ending a customs loophole \u2013 the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption -- allowing duty-free entry into the United States of packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Turned out, the U.S. postal service needed more time to figure out how to collect the duties.",
      "Businesses are baffled. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to multiple companies that are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not moving forward with any investment. We need this to be settled,\u2019\u201d said trade lawyer Gregory Husisian at the law firm Foley & Lardner. At least in Trump\u2019s first term \u201cthey knew what the ground rules were. Now they don\u2019t know if we\u2019re playing Monopoly or tic-tac-toe.\u2019\u2019",
      "Respondents to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing survey, out Monday, voiced complaints about the tariff uncertainty. \u201cThere is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it\u2019s harder to project how they will affect business,\u201d a transportation equipment company said. A chemicals firm griped: \u201cThe tariff environment regarding products from Mexico and Canada has created uncertainty and volatility among our customers.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cRight now, the tariffs are putting everybody off balance because of their unpredictability and uncertainty,\u201d said John Gulliver, president of the New England-Canada Business Council.",
      "Taylor Samuels, the owner of Las Almas Rotas, a bar and restaurant in Dallas, depends on Mexico for much of the alcohol he offers.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, including the potential impact on the price of raw materials like steel and lumber, are forcing him to review his plans to build a new restaurant.",
      "\u201cThat construction budget is now under review and may likely be delayed ... as I recalculate costs that have already been budgeted,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Sandya Dandamudi of GI Stone, a stone supplier in Chicago, said builders are having to rethink their plans.",
      "\u201cDevelopers of commercial projects like high-rises and hotels budget two years in advance, so they don\u2019t account for new tariffs,\u201d she said. \u201cThose budgets will be blown.\u2019\u2019",
      "Dandamudi said that companies will either succeed in passing the tariffs along to their customers or they will be forced to cancel projects.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs will be devastating for small businesses like ours,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward, we won\u2019t be able to sign any new contracts unless clients address the tariffs.\u201d",
      "Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, that sells Canadian whisky and other specialty spirits, said her plans for the future have been put on hold due to the tariffs. Her original plan for 2025 was to almost double her inventory and the selection she offered.",
      "\u201cFor now, we have no plans of adding more shelving or space for new items, we will stick to the footprint we have,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will delay the growth of our business, making us a bit stagnant.\u2019\u2019",

      "NEW YORK -- Macy's swung to a profit in the fourth quarter, though sales dipped with shoppers remaining cautious about spending.",
      "The strength of the quarterly profit surprised Wall Street, but sales were just below expectations and uncertainty about both the American consumer and new tariffs seeped into the company's outlook for 2025.",
      "Shares dipped 1% in morning trading Thursday.",
      "Macy's joins other retailers including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Abercrombie & Fitch that have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025.",
      "The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners resulted in immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, while roiling financial markets. Tariffs risk reigniting inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher.",
      "The U.S. slapped 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. It also doubled the tariff Trump announced last month on Chinese products, to 20%.",
      "Possibly raising anxiety further, certain aspects of U.S. trade policy appears to be fluid, making it more difficult for businesses and households to plan ahead. On Wednesday, Trump reversed course and granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.",
      "Macy's executives emphasized that the company is facing lots of uncertainty given the ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services. Company executives told analysts on the earnings call Thursday that Macy's has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It's also focusing on improving its store label brands.",
      "\u201cWe are in that retail therapy business, a place of escapism, an opportunity to get away from all of the political noise that happens every day,\u201d Macy's CEO Tony Spring said. \"And we have to lean into that. And so, I don\u2019t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term. I\u2019m not an economist, I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll go on. I challenge our teams every day to think about what do we control?\"",
      "The uncertainty comes as retailers like Macy's were already dealing with cautious consumer spending though sales at the department store have been improving.",
      "Macy's, which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reported net income of $342 million, or $1.21 per share, for the three-month period ended Feb. 1. Adjusted per-share earnings per were $1.80, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet, and reversing a $128 million loss last year.",
      "Sales fell 4.3% to $7.77 billion from $8.12 billion in the year-ago period.",
      "Comparable sales at the overall company\u2014 established business from physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 0.2%. At Macy's nameplate stores, comparable store sales dipped 1.9%.",
      "Macy's has been on a campaign to modernize stores, and that appears to be working. At the first 50 stores that have been upgraded, comparable sales rose 1.2%. Those initiatives \u2014 which include offering more service in shoe departments and more visual displays\u2014 have been added to another 75 stores.",
      "Macy's other brands continue to excel, with comparable sales growth at Bloomingdale\u2019s hitting 6.5%, while Bluemercury reported its 16th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth, the latest at of 6.2%.",
      "Macy's expects to earn $2.05 to $2.25 per share on net revenue of $21 billion to $21.4 billion in the current year. Analysts expect a profit of $2.29 per share on sales of $21.34 billion.",

      "The Associated Press has found that the Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide",
      "The Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide, throwing hundreds of projects into a precarious limbo, according to information and documents obtained by The Associated Press",
      "The move is part of a flurry of funding freezes, staffing cuts and contract cancellations by the Trump administration at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, changes that have instilled widespread uncertainty in the affordable housing industry.",
      "The some $60 million is intended to go to small community development nonprofits in small grants. The money is often used as seed funding for affordable housing projects, turning a concept into a viable development and consequently drawing in more public and private investment.",
      "Congress chose three nonprofits to distribute the grants, but HUD said in letters that it was cancelling contracts with two of the organizations which together were to distribute the $60 million. That's pushed millions in funding already promised to small nonprofits, or yet to be awarded, into the twilight zone.",
      "\u201cMany of those organizations have already committed funds to pay workers, such as HVAC technicians, local contractors, homeownership counselors,\u201d said Shaun Donovan, CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, one of the two groups whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cThey will have to stop that work immediately. That will cost local jobs, hobble the creation of affordable homes, and stall opportunity in hundreds of communities.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HUD said the program, called Section 4, will continue and is not being cut, but that \u201cthe department is consolidating some grants, while others remain.\"",
      "It remains unclear how or when the funding will arrive to the small nonprofits, which has thrown their work into disarray.",
      "\u201cNot knowing for me means we assume that the money is not coming, and that means that I have to pivot,\" said Jonathan Green, executive director of a nonprofit in Mississippi that's building a 36-unit affordable housing development in Biloxi.",
      "Green said about $20,000 in grant dollars are now in limbo, money that was meant to pay for an environmental review that could cost upwards of $10,000, and licenses and permits. That threatens discussions Green is having with potential partners and investors who want to see all the up-front work done first.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that, if the project stops altogether, we may never get it started again,\u201d he said.",
      "The development is supposed to be in East Biloxi, where lots still remain empty after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Before an ounce of dirt has been moved on the project, Green's organization has received enough calls from people eager to become tenants that they\u2019ve started a waiting list.",
      "That's the position hundreds of other small nonprofits have found themselves in, with not just their grant funds in question but investments on the line. For every dollar in grants disbursed by Enterprise Community Partners, the local nonprofits leverage another $95 in other capital, CEO Donovan said.",
      "Congress gave the national nonprofits the job of administering the grants, fielding and assessing hundreds of applications, so that the government doesn\u2019t have to, Donovan said.",
      "In one of the contract termination letters obtained by the AP, HUD said the contracts were cancelled at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency. It said the group's operations \u201cwere not in compliance\" with Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The letter also allows the organizations to appeal the termination.",
      "The Local Initiatives Support Corporation is the other group whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cWithout access to this seed capital, housing projects for hardworking, families will stall, worsening shortages and pushing distressed neighbors into overcrowded conditions or homelessness,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Habitat for Humanity International is the third nonprofit disbursing the grants, but the organization has not responded to repeated requests for comment or said if their contract was cancelled.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank has cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point, lowering credit costs for consumers and businesses to support an economy that is struggling to show solid growth.",
      "The rate decision Thursday, which was widely expected by economists, was overshadowed by concerns over a potential trade war with the U.S. and the impact of a surge in defense spending, two factors that could upend expectations for growth and inflation.",
      "The ECB\u2019s rate-setting council lowered its benchmark deposit rate to 2.5%. That should provide support for growth by making it cheaper to borrow and buy a house or expand a factory. The rate was raised to a record 4% to combat inflation that reached 10.6% in Oct. 2022, but has been reducing it steadily since June.",
      "As inflation has fallen to an annual, 2.4% concern has shifted to weak growth prospects in the 20 countries that use the euro currency. The eurozone showed zero growth in the last three months of 2024, and prospects for this year are muted amid uncertainty about U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy.",
      "President Christine Lagarde said at her post-meeting news conference that with the cut, rates were \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d on economic activity, but added that the bank was \u201cnot pre-committing to a particular rate path\" in months ahead.",
      "She acknowledged conflicting pressures ahead from trade and the prospect of more government spending. While \u201can increase in defense and infrastructure spending could also add to growth... increasing friction in global trade is adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation.\u201d",
      "At its last meeting, the bank said rates were still in \u201crestrictive\u201d territory, indicating further cuts were ahead. After Thursday, the bank's next step is less clear, said Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank.",
      "\u201cWith the increased uncertainty and the prospects of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB\u2019s direction of travel after today\u2019s rate cut is no longer as clear as it was a few weeks ago,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cA pause at the next meeting to come to terms with the new macro reality now looks like a possibility.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile new concerns that would massively reshuffle the economic picture are likely to intrude: the potential impact of new tariffs on European imports from U.S. President Trump, which could slow growth, and plans for massive new defense spending and borrowing, which could mean more growth but also more inflation.",
      "Those two forces could push the ECB in opposite directions: a hit to growth would call for lower rates in months ahead, while more persistent inflation would argue for keeping rates higher in coming months.",
      "Growth estimates for Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, shot up overnight and long-term interest rates rose in response to an agreement by the two parties that will form the country\u2019s next government to loosen constitutional limits on borrowing and exempt defense spending.",
      "That is a major turnaround in German budget policy and opens the way for a trillion or more in new borrowing and spending over the next decade.",
      "Also in the mix are concerns that Trump will impose new tariffs on European goods, hurting growth in an export-dependent economy.",
      "The 20 countries that use the euro currency and for which the ECB determines interest rate policy stagnated in the last three months of the year, showing zero growth. Consumers burned by an earlier outbreak of inflation remain cautious, while businesses have been unsettled by concerns about what Trump may do.",
      "Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, predicted the ECB would stay flexible and decide based on incoming data: \u201cThe possible push, in terms of GDP growth, from higher government spending may be offset by the pull coming from US tariffs and the net effect is unclear.\u201d"

      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street\u2019s reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018."

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Federal officials have backtracked on plans to cancel a lease for office space in New Mexico where dozens of U.S. Department of Energy employees who oversee the nation\u2019s only underground nuclear waste repository are based.",
      "The move came Thursday after U.S. Rep.

The department said the move ensures \"that these mission-critical operations continue without disruption.\u201d",
      "Vasquez said the initial notice to terminate the lease as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink government spending was reckless and shortsighted.",
      "\u201cThis facility is central to the management and disposal of defense-related nuclear waste,\u201d Vasquez said in a warning issued earlier this week. \"Its closure could severely disrupt WIPP operations, leading to delays in waste disposal and compromising the safety protocols established to protect both the public and the environment.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an \u201cunprovoked attack.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration, marking a major effort to dismantle union protections under the Trump administration. The TSA union called it on \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d and vowed to fight it.",
      "The department, in a statement announcing the termination, criticized the union whose staffers are responsible for keeping weapons off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department said that poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \u201cto safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from a top Democrat in Congress and the union.",
      "\u201cThis action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation\u2019s transportation networks,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cTSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees is the union representing the TSA workers. The federation and the TSA's then-administrator, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement in May of last year. It came amid a push by Homeland Security to improve the pay for the frontline workers, whose pay has historically lagged behind that of other government employees. Pekoske has credited the pay increases, which went into effect in 2023, as helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "The union said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers. AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\u201cOur union has been out in front challenging this administration\u2019s unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \u201cNow our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\u201d",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers\u2019 collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cvision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\u201d Stahl wrote. \u201cThis determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\u201d",
      "Stahl said the agency \u201cwill establish alternative procedures\u201d to address employee concerns and grievances \u201cin a fair and transparent manner.\u201d",
      "The end of the collective bargaining agreement was immediately slammed by the top Democrat on the Homeland Security committee in Congress, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who praised the work of TSA staffers in protecting air travel.",
      "\u201cAttempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSince the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA\u2019s attrition rates have plummeted.\u201d",
      "Thompson also criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \u201cflat out wrong anti-union talking points.\u201d He said the real aim was \u201cdiminishing\u201d the workforce so \u201cthey can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with journalists",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with the press. Here are some of the key topics covered during his Friday press conference.",
      "China has clashed frequently with the Philippines over ownership of and access to islands in the South China Sea, whose rich fishing grounds China claims virtually in its entirety. However, Wang was quick to place blame elsewhere, saying Manila was being manipulated by forces \u201coutside the region,\u201d its standard term for the U.S.",
      "Wang called the entire conflict a \u201cshadow play,\u201d saying an unidentified regional official had used the term at a recent meeting, and said each incident was a \u201cline of script\u201d disseminated by the foreign media with the goal of \u201csmearing China.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with the law. When managing Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal, we will also reflect our humanitarian spirit according to actual needs. But I want to make it clear here that infringement and provocation will inevitably bear its own fruit, and those who are willing to be chess pieces will eventually be discarded.\u201d",
      "Wang also said that Chinese cooperation with its neighbors had eliminated many of the compounds where Chinese nationals, many of them coerced or lured by false promises of legitimate jobs, are forced to contact people in China in a bid to extract money from them through false claims of debts owed or other illegal means.",
      "\u201cAll the cyber fraud parks in northern Myanmar near the border have been cleared. China, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos are working together to crack down on cyber fraud in the Thai-Myanmar border area. Our mission is to cut off the evil hands reaching out to the people and eradicate the cancer of online cyber fraud,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Such operations, usually linked to organized crime, are notoriously quick to resume operations elsewhere. China has been battling the issue for years as the gangs grown increasingly sophisticated in their access to victims' private information. Hundreds of citizens from other countries have also been caught up in such fraudulent schemes targeting victims as far away as the United States.",
      "Wang referred to the upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, saying \u201cthere are still some people in Japan who have not reflected on their mistakes.\u201d China's education and propaganda systems keep alive memories of Japan's brutal invasion and occupation of much of China before and during the war and anti-Japanese consumer boycotts and other protests pop-up over perceived slights.",
      "Wang also linked the issue to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that was a Japanese colony until the end of the war and which maintains close ties to Japan to this day. China claims the island as its own territory and has threatened to take control by force if necessary. Wang said \u201cit is better to remember that if Taiwan causes trouble, it is to cause trouble for Japan.\u201d",
      "China also claims uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Japan, and regularly sends ships and planes into areas surrounding them, much as it does with Taiwan. That prompts Japan to scramble jets to defend what it says are islands legitimately absorbed before World War II because no other nation had a legal claim to them. That too has proved a source of tension in the region and a space where China can challenge the authority of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "Wand touted China as \u201cthe center of stability in Asia, an engine of economic development and a support for regional security,\u201d while blasting the U.S. for basing intermediate-range missiles around China and having \u201cdone nothing but stir up trouble and create divisions.\u201d China advocates \u201copen regionalism and share Asia\u2019s development opportunities on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win results.\u201d",
      "Wang said \u201cif every country stresses my country first and is obsessed with a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign (across) the world again.\u201d While China has been the subject of suspicion and concern from the Indian Ocean to northern Japan, the South Pacific has lately emerged as a major area of competition between China on one side and the U.S., Australia and New Zealand on the other.",
      "China\u2019s secret security agreements and promises of infrastructure have prompted the three to tighten relations in recognition of the islands\u2019 strategic geographic location after years of what some have described as neglect. However, a U.S. cutoff in aid, along with generous Chinese incentives, could further push them into Beijing\u2019s arms. Three of these \u2014 Tuvalu, Palau and the Marshall Islands are also among Taiwan\u2019s handful of formal diplomatic allies.",

      "Every year, bills are introduced in state legislatures across the country seeking to end the changing of clocks twice a year",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Looking forward to more evening sunlight thanks to daylight saving time this weekend?",
      "Many in the golf industry like the time change, too, and they are pushing to make that annual switch permanent.",
      "The move is intended to encourage more evening golf and to stave off efforts to establish permanent standard time, which would leave less time for an evening on the links. And it is those late afternoon players who tend to buy food and drinks in the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cWe would lose 100 tee times a day if daylight saving time goes away,\u201d said Connor Farrell, general manager of Stone Creek Golf Course in Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cSwitching to permanent standard time would cost us $500,000 a year.\"",
      "Golf has deep roots in the history of daylight saving time, which begins for most states at 2 a.m. Sunday when clocks \u201cspring forward\u201d by one hour. Some credit goes to William Willett, a British builder and avid golfer who in 1905 published a pamphlet advocating for moving clocks ahead in April and returning them back to their regular settings in September. The U.S. adopted a version of that during World War I and again in World War II.",
      "Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 that set up the biannual time change, and lobbying efforts by the golf industry are largely credited for Congress expanding daylight saving time by a month in the mid-1980s.",
      "But for as long as it has been around, the constant clock adjusting has drawn the ire of Americans weary of losing an hour of sleep in the spring only to be faced with the early onset of darkness in the fall. That exhaustion has led to hundreds of bills introduced in nearly every state over the years to halt the practice.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that in the last six years, 20 states have passed measures calling for a switch to year-round daylight saving time, many at the cajoling of golf industry lobbyists. But while states could switch to permanent standard time \u2014 as Arizona and Hawaii have done \u2014 Congress would need to change the law to allow permanent daylight saving time.",
      "That hindrance \u2014 along with arguments that permanent standard time would improve sleep quality and foster safer morning commutes \u2014 has seen more states consider opting out of daylight saving time. Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced bills this year to make standard time permanent.",
      "Nebraska is among several states considering competing bills to make either standard time or daylight saving time permanent. That drew Joe Kohout, a lobbyist for the Nebraska Golf Alliance, to testify in favor of year-round daylight saving time.",
      "Late afternoon golf leagues account for up to 40% of the annual revenue of some Nebraska courses, Kohout said, while a majority of golf instructors reported that nearly 50% of their lessons are taught after 4 p.m.",
      "Under permanent standard time, \u201cNebraska\u2019s golf courses will lose revenue, be forced to raise prices, and in some cases could be driven out of business,\u201d he said.",
      "The Utah Golf Association is also fighting a bill to make standard time permanent.",
      "\u201cThe argument that changing clocks twice a year is an inconvenience does not outweigh the year-round benefits of having more usable daylight hours in the evenings,\u201d it posted on social media.",
      "In Indiana, golf course owner Linda Rogers succeeded in lobbying the Legislature to institute daylight saving time in 2006. Now a state senator, Rogers is fighting an effort to return to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cDaylight savings time allows someone that, you know, worked until 5 o\u2019clock to come out and still play at least nine holes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just golf. There are so many outdoor activities that people want to be outside for and enjoy later in the summertime.\u201d",
      "The National Golf Course Owners Association, which has about 4,000 members, recently polled stakeholders on the matter. The vast majority favored either permanent daylight saving time or the status quo of changing the clocks, said CEO Jay Karen. Only about 6% backed a change to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cIf standard time was to be made permanent, thousands of courses would be harmed by that,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Even so, Karen's group is not advocating for a change to permanent daylight saving because it could hurt hundreds of courses that cater to early morning golfers, he said. Those include courses in retirement communities, vacation resorts where late tee times interfere with dinner plans and Sun Belt courses where extreme late-day heat sees golfers favoring early tee times.",
      "\u201cWe feel like status quo is no harm, no foul,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Republican Iowa state Rep. John Wills introduced a bill this year to make the change to permanent daylight savings. But he has been under pressure to amend the bill to permanent standard time.",
      "Wills was considering it until he heard arguments on how that change could affect golf.",
      "\u2019\u201cI think I might push back in the future and say, you know, the golf industry needs this,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The Albanian Cabinet has decided to shut down TikTok for 12 months, blaming the video-sharing platform for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian Cabinet decided on Thursday to shut down TikTok for 12 months, blaming the popular video-sharing platform for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children.",
      "Education Minister Ogerta Manastirliu said officials are in contact with TikTok on installing filters like parental control, age verification and the inclusion of the Albanian language in the application.",
      "Authorities had conducted 1,300 meetings with some 65,000 parents who \u201crecommended and were in favor of the shut down or limiting the TikTok platform,\" the minister said.",
      "The Cabinet initiated the move last year after a teen stabbed another teenager to death in November after a quarrel that started on TikTok.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the government's decision.",
      "When Prime Minister Edi Rama said in December they were aiming at closing the social media platform, TikTok asked for \u201curgent clarity from the Albanian government\u201d on the case of the stabbed teenager.",
      "On Thursday Rama said they were in a \u201cpositive dialogue with the company,\" and that TikTok would visit the country soon to offer \u201ca series of measures on increasing the security for children.\u201d",
      "The company said it had \u201cfound no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.\u201d",
      "Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to researchers.",
      "There has been increasing concern from Albanian parents after reports of children being inspired by content on social media to take knives to school, or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok.",
      "Authorities have increased police presence at some schools and set up other measures including training programs for teachers, students and their parents.",
      "The opposition has not agreed with TikTok\u2019s closure and has set March 15 for a protest against the move. It said the ban was \u201can act of intolerance, fear and terror from free thinking and expression.\u201d",
      "TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, has faced questions in many countries and was briefly offline in the United States recently to comply with a law that requires ByteDance to divest the app or be banned in the U.S.",
      "The app suspended its services in the U.S. for less than a day before restoring service following assurances from Trump that he would postpone banning it.",
      "Earlier this week, the U.K.\u2019s data protection watchdog said was investigating how the app uses the personal information of 13 to 17-year-olds to deliver content recommendations to them.",
      "The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said that there are growing concerns around how social media platforms were using data generated by children\u2019s online activity to power their recommendation algorithms, and the potential for young people to see inappropriate or harmful content as a result."

    "story": [
      "Cadillac\u2019s Formula 1 team has received official approval to join the grid in 2026 and its owners insist the team will be ready to compete",
      "Cadillac's Formula 1 team received official approval Friday to join the grid in 2026 and its owners insist the team will be ready to compete.",
      "Although the grid expansion was approved last November, it was not until Friday that governing body FIA and Formula One Management said the Cadillac F1 effort meets all the requirements to become the 11th team in the series next season.",
      "\u201cI am proud to lead the Federation in this progressive step for the championship,\u201d FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem said in a statement, who called adding an 11th team \u201ca milestone\u201d and a \u201ctransformative moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cGM/Cadillac brings fresh energy, aligning with the new FIA 2026 regulations and ushering in an exciting era for the sport.\u201d",
      "The team is owned by General Motors and TWG Motorsports, an arm of the larger TWG Global group owned by co-chairs Mark Walter and Thomas Tull. TWG Global has controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, as well as stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers and other ventures.",
      "TWG Motorsports is also the majority owner of Andretti Global, which competes in IndyCar, Indy NXT and Formula E; NASCAR team Spire Motorsports; the two-car IMSA sports car GTP program fielded by Wayne Taylor Racing; and a stake in Walkinshaw Andretti United, the Bathurst 1000-winning race team competing in Australia\u2019s Supercars Championship.",
      "\u201cThe Cadillac Formula 1 Team\u2019s presence in the paddock will inspire future competitors and fans,\" said Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1. \u201cTheir entry strengthens our mission to push motorsport\u2019s boundaries at the highest level. As we said in November, the commitment by General Motors to bring a Cadillac team to Formula 1 was an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport.\u201d",
      "Cadillac F1 will be the second American-owned team on the grid, joining Haas F1, which is owned by California businessman Gene Haas. The Haas program does not have an American driver or a partnership with an American manufacturer, but it is sponsored by MoneyGram.",
      "Cadillac F1 anticipates being distinctively American with its partnership with General Motors and the possibility of IndyCar driver Colton Herta, a California native, in the two-car lineup. It comes at a time when F1 has three races in the United States \u2014 in Miami, Austin, Texas, and Las Vegas \u2014 and teams are battling for sponsorship from American companies as the global series gains popularity in the U.S.",
      "It took more than four years to get the project approved by FOM, despite the backing of the FIA and Ben Sulayem. At issue was an apparent breakdown in any relationship between F1 and Michael Andretti, who spent part of one season as an F1 driver and has never been warmly embraced in the European series.",
      "But Andretti sold controlling interest of his motorsports ventures to Dan Towriss late last year and is no longer involved in the project. That helped TWG and Cadillac get the F1 bid approved.",
      "\u201cFor the past years, we have worked hand in hand with GM, to lay a robust foundation for an extraordinary F1 entry,\u201d said Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports. \u201cNow, with 2026 in our sights, we\u2019re accelerating our efforts \u2014 expanding our facilities, refining cutting-edge technologies and continuing to assemble top-tier talent.\u201d",
      "Cadillac's powertrains will not be ready for some time and the team will lease engines from Ferrari until General Motors has a product ready to compete. The powertrains will be built in a facility on the North Carolina campus of Hendrick Motorsports in Concord, while the F1 program will be run from a new facility being built in Indiana and a second factory in Silverstone, England.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled the Cadillac Formula 1 Team is official, as the team has been accelerating its work,\u201d General Motors President Mark Reuss said. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful for the support from the FIA and Formula 1 leadership for us and for our partners at TWG. The excitement only grows as we get closer to showcasing GM\u2019s engineering expertise on the prestigious global stage of F1.\u201d",
      "Towriss told The Associated Press that Cadillac F1 already has a 2026 car built that has been to the wind tunnel and work continues at a rapid pace. The team is also hiring at a head-spinning rate with motorsports and Formula 1 team executive Graeme Lowdon named team principal, and industry veteran Russ O\u2019Blenes named CEO of TWG GM Performance Power Units \u2014 a new company that aims to make Cadillac a full-works team that builds both the chassis and power units.",
      "TWG Motorsports has more than 300 employees working on aerodynamics, chassis and component development, as well as software and vehicle dynamics simulation.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the effort put in by the entire Cadillac Formula 1 Team. This announcement is the next step in getting on the grid and continues our efforts towards building a full-works team,\" Lowdown said. \"Through the long and thorough application process, we have never lost pace in our planning or our belief in the mission. We can\u2019t wait to go racing and give fans a new team to cheer for.\u201d",
      "Towriss will not tip his hand at a possible driver lineup, but those mentioned for the two seats include Herta, who must finish fourth or higher in the IndyCar standings this season to earn the Super License required to compete in F1. Herta last weekend surprised many when he said he wasn't even sure he wanted the seat.",
      "Other drivers mentioned as candidates for the second seat are Sergio Perez, Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, all of whom were on the F1 grid last season but don\u2019t have seats for 2025.",

In this slow-pitch gem of a baseball movie \u2014 a middle-aged \u201cSandlot\u201d \u2014 time is slipping away, but they\u2019re going down swinging.",
      "Money, analytics and whatever\u2019s on ESPN can sometimes cloud what sports is to most people: A refuge. \u201cEephus,\u201d in that way, is a change-up of a baseball movie, an elegiac ode to the humbler weekend warriors who are driven by nothing but genuine affection for the game. Richly detailed and mordantly deadpan, \u201cEephus\" adopts their pace of play, soaking up all the sesame-seed flavor that goes along with it.",
      "The title comes from an unnaturally slow pitch not slung but lobbed toward home. When I was a kid pitching, I liked to uncork one from time to time, much to my coach\u2019s dismay. The metaphor isn\u2019t hard to grasp. One player describes it as a pitch you can get bored watching, even making you lose track of time.",
      "Much of the same applies to \u201cEephus,\u201d which drifts player to player, play to play, less as an ensemble piece than like a roving spectator. The guys, themselves, have no more than a handful of fans, including the diehard scorekeeper Fanny (Cliff Blake). Frederick Wiseman, the great documentarian whose films chronicle nothing so much as institutions kept alive over time, is the voice of the announcer.",
      "I earlier called Lund\u2019s film an ode, but it\u2019s not a sentimental movie. Time\u2019s passage, which no ballgame or perfectly thrown eephus can halt, grows increasingly disquieting as the afternoon light gives way to nightfall. That, to finish the game, they play into near-total darkness, with only headlights to see the ball, is a sign of desperation as much as it is commitment. After all, one guy in the dugout is listening to a radio broadcast of a ballgame, from 1972.",
      "What\u2019s being lost? It\u2019s not a strip mall the field is to be turned into but something harder to quibble with: a school. They could drive half an hour to another field, but that\u2019s said to be half Little League, half farmer\u2019s market. They aren\u2019t a collection of pals, either. They don\u2019t hang out away from the diamond. Things they don\u2019t talk about: work, families, politics. Things they do: eyecare for the ump.",
      "In the annals of baseball movies, \u201cEephus\u201d doesn\u2019t belong in the Hall of Fame with \u201cBull Durham\u201d or \u201cA League of Their Own.\u201d The closest it gets to the big leagues is an appearance by Bill \u201cSpaceman\u201d Lee, the 1970s southpaw and eephus adherent.",
      "But \u201cEephus\u201d is just as deserving of a place in that hardball pantheon, only in some minor ball realm, well below single A. Here, they don't throw \u201chigh cheese\u201d but such meatballs that, as one player riffs, you could call it pasta primavera. To call this a field of dreams would be pushing it. But it's a lovely way to pass some time.",
      "\u201cEephus,\u201d a Music Box release is not rated by the Motion Picture Association but contains coarse language. Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "LAKE PLACID, N.Y. -- Picture this: A sliding athlete wins an Olympic medal in Lake Placid next winter, then is chauffeured down to New York for an award ceremony at Rockefeller Center a few days later with thousands of people there to cheer on both moments.",
      "It could happen.",
      "The element of incorporating New York into the Olympics is just one of the unique details inside Lake Placid\u2019s plan if the two-time Olympic host gets asked to be the site of the sliding events for next winter\u2019s Milan-Cortina Games, according to documents reviewed this week by The Associated Press. Lake Placid was picked as the just-in-case backup track last year, and with the Olympics less than a year away a decision could be looming on whether the Adirondack village will be called to serve once again.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing is to give the athletes what they deserve, and that is a true celebration,\u201d said Ashley Walden, the CEO of the Olympic Regional Development Authority, which manages the Olympic venues in Lake Placid. \u201cThey've been working for it for four years. It needs to be bigger than the everyday race. That's the key to all of this. That's where New York City and the fanfare that we can offer, in addition to the race-night competition here, is crucial.\u201d",
      "How and when the decision comes on where the sliding races will be is unclear. Every indication put forth by Italian organizers is that the rebuilding of the historic Eugenio Monti track in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, will be done in time. But there is also a push for a definitive answer, especially with homologation \u2014 a fancy way of saying getting the necessary testing of the track done as part of the certifying process \u2014 set to begin in less than three weeks.",
      "Simico, the Italian government agency in charge of building the Cortina track, said Friday that \u201ceverything is going according to plan\u201d and that ice is already being laid down on parts of the track, with pre-homologation slated for March 24-31. But International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation president Ivo Ferriani reminded sliders at Wednesday night\u2019s opening of their sports\u2019 world championships in Lake Placid that they may be back at Mount Van Hoevenberg next year for the Olympics, which caused the Italian contingent in the stands to audibly groan when he said that during his brief opening speech.",
      "Ferriani didn't offer a timetable. And that's the part Lake Placid \u2014 and really, the rest of the sliding world \u2014 is waiting to hear. Lake Placid's plan will take months to execute, and the sooner a decision comes the better, officials there say.",
      "\u201cWe are coming to a crucial point where we have to make a decision,\" Walden said Friday. \"We have a vision for what it should be, and we want to be successful in achieving that. And the longer and the less lead time that we have, the less likely that is.\u201d",
      "Lake Placid's bid plan includes the possibility of charter flights to bring athletes to and from upstate New York from Italy if those Olympians choose to attend the opening or closing ceremony there. It even details how sled transport from Europe will work and how other airports in the area \u2014 such as Montreal, Albany and Plattsburgh, New York, in addition to New York's John F. Kennedy \u2014 could be involved.",
      "The Lake Placid plan calls for Paul Smith's College, a small private school about 28 miles from Mount Van Hoevenberg, to serve as an athlete's village; the school would essentially close for January and February to accommodate that plan, and students there \u2014 many of whom are studying either sports management or hospitality \u2014 could work the games.",
      "\u201cWe want the athletes to have their village feel and Paul Smith's lets us accomplish that,\u201d Walden said. \u201cIt's the perfect size.\u201d",
      "Hotel rooms in the area have been secured for potential visitors and, either way, ORDA will spend about $80 million in the coming months primarily to build more spectator seating and modernize the refrigeration systems at the track. The construction involved in those projects is already underway and will pick up rapidly once the track is closed for the season around the end of this month.",
      "There are parallels within the plans for Lake Placid and Italy that organizers in the Adirondacks point to as well. Part of the marketing plan is touting that there's basically one degree of separation in terms of latitude between Lake Placid and Milan, and how it's essentially five hours between Lake Placid and New York \u2014 almost the same distance between Milan and Cortina.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wrap my head around an Olympics being here,\u201d U.S. men\u2019s skeleton athlete Dan Barefoot said. \u201cI actually don\u2019t even know how Lake Placid will handle it. It\u2019d be insane.\u201d",
      "New York also cites statistics saying the state is home to about 3.1 million people with Italian heritage, second only to Argentina in terms of non-Italian locales in the world. And while Lake Placid played host to the Olympics in 1932 and 1980, New York City has never been an Olympic site.",
      "The Rockefeller Center plan \u2014 which would include some collaboration with Olympic broadcaster NBC, which has a studio right there \u2014 calls for a medals podium, a mini sliding track, athlete interviews on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d with their medals, viewing parties, athlete meet-and-greets and cultural integration with celebrities, businesspeople and restaurateurs of Italian-American descent.",
      "\u201cYou have this incredible city that loves to celebrate, and these athletes that are displaced from one country now in a place and competing here and have these special elements of celebration,\" ORDA spokeswoman Darcy Norfolk said. \u201cIt\u2019s the piece that I think also showcases New York state, Lake Placid to New York City, and kind of what we can do together.\"",

      "Pregnant players on the women\u2019s tennis tour now can receive 12 months of paid maternity leave, and those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months off with pay",
      "Pregnant players on the women's tennis tour now can receive 12 months of paid maternity leave, and those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months off with pay, under a program sponsored by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and announced Thursday by the WTA.",
      "\u201cIndependent contractors and self-employed individuals don\u2019t typically have these kinds of maternity benefits provided and available to them. They have to go out and sort of figure out those benefits for themselves,\u201d WTA CEO Portia Archer said. \u201cThis is really sort of novel and groundbreaking.\u201d",
      "More than 300 players are eligible for the fund, which is retroactive to Jan. 1. The WTA would not disclose how much money is involved.",
      "The program \u2014 which the WTA touted as \u201cthe first time in women\u2019s sports history that comprehensive maternity benefits are available to independent, self-employed athletes\u201d \u2014 also provides grants for fertility treatments, including egg freezing and IVF.",
      "It's part of a wider trend: As women's sports rise, there is an emphasis on meeting maternity and parental needs.",
      "The WTA says 25 moms are active on tour; one, Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Belinda Bencic, won a title last month after returning from maternity leave in October.",
      "More and more pros in tennis have returned to action after having children, including past No. 1-ranked players and Grand Slam title winners such as Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Kim Clijsters, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka.",
      "Azarenka \u2014 a member of the WTA Players' Council, which Archer acknowledged played a key role in pushing for this fund \u2014 thinks these benefits will encourage lower-ranked or lower-earning athletes to take as much time off as they feel they need after becoming a parent, rather than worrying about losing out on income while not entering tournaments.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly one of the aims of the program: to provide the financial resources, the flexibility, the support, so that these athletes, regardless of where they\u2019re ranked, but particularly those who earn less, will have that agency ... to decide when and how they want to start their families,\u201d Archer said.",
      "And, Azarenka said, this could lead some players to decide to become parents before retiring from the sport for good.",
      "\u201cEvery feedback we\u2019ve heard from players who are mothers \u2014 or who are not mothers \u2014 is like, \u2018Wow, this is an incredible opportunity for us,\u2019\u201d said 2012-13 Australian Open champion Azarenka, whose son, Leo, is 8. \u201cI believe it\u2019s really going to change the conversation in sports. But going beyond sports, it\u2019s a global conversation, and I\u2019m happy that we're (part of it).\u201d",
      "Other steps the WTA has taken in recent years to benefit players include steering more women into coaching, implementing safeguarding, attempting to stem cyberbullying, and increasing prize money with an eye to pay that equals what men receive in the sport.",
      "The Public Investment Fund, or PIF, became the WTA's global partner last year, after much public debate \u2014 Hall of Famers Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were among the critics \u2014 over questions about LGBTQ+ and women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The kingdom now hosts the season-ending WTA Finals and an ATP event for rising stars of men's tennis. The PIF sponsors the WTA and ATP rankings.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to provide the benefits were it not for this relationship and the funding that PIF provides,\u201d Archer said.",
      "In golf, which like tennis is an individual sport without guaranteed salaries, the LPGA introduced an updated maternity leave policy in 2019 that lets athletes have the same playing status when they return.",
      "In soccer, both the NWSL and the U.S. women\u2019s national team have collective bargaining agreements that allow for pregnancy leave and parental leave; the NWSL pays the full base salary while an athlete is pregnant.",
      "In basketball, the WNBA's CBA guarantees full pay during maternity leave.",
      "For tennis, Azarenka said, the PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program is \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's an incredible beginning. Monumental change,\" she said. \"But I think we can look into how we can expand this fund for bigger, better things.\u201d",

      "If Skenes is being honest \u2014 and the former Air Force cadet is nothing if not pathologically sincere \u2014 he's still getting used to the outsized attention he's commanded since making his debut last May. Yet, it also beats the alternative. If his now fully-bearded mug isn't plastered throughout Florida's Sunshine Coast this time next year, he'll know why.",
      "\u201cIf I start sucking, my photo is not going to be (there),\u201d he told The Associated Press recently.",
      "Skenes understands in a way that belies his age that none of the trappings of his already remarkable success \u2014 the top overall pick in the 2023 draft finished third in last year's NL Cy Young voting too even though he didn't play a full season \u2014 will stick if he doesn't find a way to build on one of the most remarkable rookie years in a generation.",
      "Sure, the hype is nice. And yes, he's learned to lean into it a little bit. It's kind of hard not to when a baseball card featuring a patch of your jersey becomes arguably the hottest collectible in recent memory, your girlfriend happens to be one of the most followed athlete/influencers in the country and the stands are filled with little kids sporting No. 30 T-shirts and donning plastic mustaches of their own whenever you go to work.",
      "Skenes finds himself at the confluence of the game and the culture at large. From a fastball that regularly hits triple digits to a \u201csplinker\u201d borne out of experimentation, he has the kind of \u201cstuff\u201d that sends baseball purists scrambling for superlatives. He couples it with a mix of swagger and savvy that could \u2014 in theory \u2014 make him Major League Baseball's first Gen Z crossover star.",
      "It's a lot to take in for someone who was a late-bloomer by baseball standards, not truly coming into his own until his sophomore year at Air Force, where the former catcher developed so rapidly on the mound he made the difficult but necessary decision to transfer to LSU.",
      "Ask Skenes if he wants to be the \u201cface\u201d of the game and he deflects. He's been doing this as a pro less than two years. That kind of honorific, for the moment anyway, is reserved for the Shohei Ohtanis, Aaron Judges and Mike Trouts of the world, childhood idols quickly becoming peers.",
      "Those guys have earned the right. He hasn't. Not yet anyway.",
      "Besides, \"that stuff takes energy frankly,\u201d Skenes said flatly.",
      "Energy that at this stage of his career he feels would be better spent refining his repertoire and trying to lead the Pirates out of a near-decade of malaise. While Skenes became an instant box office sensation from the moment he was called up, Pittsburgh faded in late summer to a 76-86 finish.",
      "There is a sense of urgency pulsing throughout Pirates City this spring. Perhaps because the clock is already ticking on the Skenes Era. Technically he is under team control through 2029. If Skenes sticks around that long \u2014 hardly a given considering Pittsburgh has traded franchise cornerstones like Gerrit Cole and Andrew McCutchen when they became too expensive \u2014 he ultimately seems destined for a megadeal from deeper-pocketed franchises like the Dodgers or Yankees.",
      "Skenes would prefer not to talk about his future. There's too much at stake in the present. He thinks the 2024 Pirates were \u201can underperforming team,\u201d not unlike the one he was on as a freshman at Air Force.",
      "The following season, he was named a co-captain, and the Falcons improved, though he stressed he needed a lot of \u201cgrace\u201d from his teammates as he found his way. He's drawing on that experience to try and take a more visible, vocal role on a mostly young team that's still learning how to win.",
      "What that leadership looks like is still a little unclear. He doesn't plan to force things, optimistic that it will happen organically, though he was quick to add he's \u201cnot going to be the guy who is (cursing) other guys.\u201d",
      "He's focused on example setting. This is the same player, after all, who wears suits to the ballpark on the days he pitches. Who firmly but gently reminds Pirates prospect and good friend/workout partner Bubba Chandler that a given rep doesn't count if Chandler didn't execute it perfectly.",
      "\u201cThat's what elite people do,\u201d the 22-year-old Chandler said.",
      "It's why Skenes' more established teammates aren't worried about the buzz that could consume others overwhelming him. Skenes is simply not wired that way. He is, as veteran left-handed starter Bailey Falter put it, \u201ca big old donkey,\u201d a testament to both Skenes' size and what Falter called his \u201cinsane\u201d work ethic.",
      "Skenes is aware he is supremely gifted. He does not take those gifts for granted. There isn't a meal, a drill or a decision that isn't considered and thought out. He spent the offseason studying video trying to figure out how to become more efficient. He also is trying to add a true sinker to his repertoire. The early returns from spring training have been promising.",
      "It's the game at large that matters to Skenes. Everything else that comes from his unique ability to manipulate a baseball to his will is secondary, even his future.",
      "The spotlight only figures to get brighter, both in Pittsburgh and beyond for someone Chandler called \u201cthe biggest freaking name in sports right now.\u201d",
      "Skenes just shook his head when that moniker was passed along.",
      "\u201cI really try as much as I can to try and insulate myself from all that,\u201d he said. \"You can\u2019t completely avoid it. But I try to insulate myself as much as I can from it to where I don\u2019t have that perception.\u201d",
      "He is willing to do what he can to promote the game up to a point. Yet there's a line he is intent on holding. The kid who grew up an Angels fan in Southern California learned about more than just baseball while watching Trout and Ohtani. Both are all-time greats who have also fiercely guarded their privacy, lending them an air of mystique.",
      "Baseball appears to be in the midst of a resurgence. Skenes understands his popularity is a small part of it. Just don't expect him to start flooding social media \u2014 he doesn't even have an active TikTok account, although he's easy to find on MLB's feed \u2014 or popping up on your favorite podcast regularly.",
      "Baseball's Next Big Thing is more intent on chasing greatness instead. Yes, fame is \u201ccool.\u201d It's also not the point.",
      "\u201cAll we want to do is play the same game we've played since we were 3 or 4 years old,\" he said. \u201cAnd all this other stuff comes with it, you kind of have to be built up to do that. Everybody chooses how to do it in their own way. That\u2019s very much how I am.\"",

      "\u201cI was actually sitting in a parking lot with a buddy, he owns a gym down in College Station (Texas),\u201d Naquin said. \u201cI just looked at him and said, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to pitch.\u2019 We went and picked up a glove and we started playing catch. It was as simple as that, to be honest with you.\u201d",
      "That friend was Clay Tillman, who runs a sports performance center. He regularly played catch with Naquin and worked out a strength program for him.",
      "The 33-year-old Naquin says he hasn\u2019t pitched in an actual game since throwing in a scrimmage while playing for Texas A&M in 2010. He said he also pitched in high school, mostly closing but also starting a couple of games.",
      "But he starred at Texas A&M and got to the big leagues as an outfielder who happened to have an elite throwing arm.",
      "Baseball Savant rated Naquin\u2019s arm strength in the 98th percentile among major leaguers in 2021 and in the 94th percentile in 2022, his last two full seasons in the majors. Naquin played just eight games with the Chicago White Sox in 2023.",
      "Naquin said Friday his fastball velocity has topped out at 97 mph but is more consistently at 94-96. He said he also has a changeup and a cutter.",
      "\u201cI definitely think personally there\u2019s more in there, doing it the right way and learning from these guys and learning my body and how it moves and recovering the right way,\u201d Naquin said.",
      "Naquin said he had started sending out video of himself in the early stages of this experiment and added that \u201cat some point, I think some people started to realize it was for real.\u201d",
      "He also said his agent had reached out to teams and noted that a scout had attended one of his bullpen sessions at College Station.",
      "Naquin is attempting this comeback with the same organization that selected him with the 15th overall pick in the 2015 draft. Naquin played for the Guardians from 2016-20.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful to be somewhere where I would say and from what I\u2019ve heard is No. 1 in pitching development and just treating their pitchers how they should be treated,\u201d Naquin said. \u201cWhat an opportunity I have, to come into that. This is also somewhere where I\u2019m comfortable, I\u2019ve been around. There\u2019s familiar faces. It\u2019s a good recipe for success if done in the right way, and I think I\u2019m in a really good spot for that.\u201d",

      "LAKE PLACID, N.Y. -- The latest addition to the list of amenities available to athletes at the bobsled and skeleton world championships is a room inside a lodge just down the hill from the finish line. There are some stuffed animals, tons of toys, Mickey Mouse coloring books and big boxes of crayons.",
      "This is the family space. These days, it\u2019s a needed part of the sliding circuit.",
      "There are four mothers expected to compete in the world championships that got officially underway Thursday in Lake Placid \u2014 U.S. skeleton athlete Kelly Curtis, Swiss bobsledder Nadja Pasternack, and U.S. bobsledders Elana Meyers Taylor and Kaillie Humphries. It\u2019s believed to be the highest number of mothers racing at a world championships.",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t forgotten about us,\u201d Curtis said.",
      "All four women missed time from competing during their pregnancies \u2014 for Meyers Taylor, it\u2019s been two absences, since she\u2019s a mom of two now. But the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, the governing body for those two sports, decided in recent years to protect women who wanted to add to their families by ensuring that they didn\u2019t lose their world rankings while taking the time off.",
      "That means they were able to jump right back into World Cup racing when they were ready to do so \u2014 and not having to start from the bottom of the rankings means the path to qualify for the next Olympics in February 2026 became a bit easier for all of them.",
      "\u201cI wanted to be able to prove to myself that I could come back,\u201d said Humphries, the only three-time Olympic gold medalist in women\u2019s bobsled history. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to feed into what I heard for the majority of my career, that having a baby ends your career. I didn\u2019t want that to be the case. And so, a big part for me was proving I could come back and do it, regardless of the results, regardless of how it all plays out.\u201d",
      "The kids seem to have their own followings at the track at this point. Bobsled and skeleton sliders are relatively close-knit, with people seeing the same people at tracks around the world all winter. Meyers Taylor, Humphries and Curtis have all said since becoming mothers that they rely on their friends and teammates for help when needed, and for the most part they travel with their partners or families for support.",
      "In a social media post earlier this year, Meyers Taylor discussed how her sons were both born deaf and how one also has Down Syndrome \u2014 and how the decision to have them with her on the World Cup circuit was not an easy one to make.",
      "\u201cMy fears were quickly laid to rest as I quickly realized not only would they have the opportunity to see the world, they would have an immense amount love poured into them on a daily basis by my (U.S.) teammates and the many, many friends I\u2019ve made throughout my years with bobsled,\u201d wrote Meyers Taylor, who has a record five women\u2019s Olympic bobsled medals.",
      "Pasternack \u2014 who gave birth in December 2023, after going into labor while cheering Swiss teammates on at a race in La Plagne, France \u2014 returned to sliding just 12 weeks ago, and made her way into the world championships with relative ease.",
      "\u201cBack like she never left,\u201d German bobsledder Laura Nolte said.",
      "Meyers Taylor and Humphries were tied for sixth in the World Cup standings this season in two-woman bobsled. Meyers Taylor was eighth in the world monobob standings this season with a pair of wins and conceivably could have been as high as fifth if the Americans hadn\u2019t skipped the last race of the season to prepare for worlds. Curtis \u2014 who is a member of the U.S. Air Force, stationed in Italy, and someone who gave birth a little over a year ago \u2014 struggled for much of the season before hitting her best stride at the end; back-to-back seventh-place showings got her into the world championships.",
      "It\u2019s not new for moms to be competing as sliders. Curtis remembers the scene at the 2014 Olympics when U.S. skeleton athlete Noelle Pikus-Pace \u2014 then a mother of two \u2014 won a silver medal in Sochi and ran into the stands to celebrate with her family. That was the moment when Curtis decided to try sliding.",
      "\u201cThe postpartum period, hormones, everything, the recalibration calibration has kind of taken me by a little bit more of a surprise,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m back pushing to where I used to be, and I think the mind-body connection for the actual sliding, relaxation, part is taking longer to come back than I thought.\u201d",
      "No matter what happens over the next two weeks, whether medals are won or lost, the kids won\u2019t care much. Humphries \u2014 one of the most driven athletes in the sport \u2014 says the challenge just of getting pregnant (she and her husband spent a fortune on fertility treatments before finally having success) and now being a mother has brought newfound perspective.",
      "It\u2019s a challenge for dads, too. U.S. bobsledder Frank Del Duca doesn\u2019t have his child with him when he travels the world and makes no secret of how difficult that is. But he marvels at what Curtis, Humphries, Meyers Taylor and Pasternack can do.",
      "\u201cTo have their body go through that transformation hormonally and to be able to provide for another human being, then to turn around and start lifting weights, sprinting, traveling, competing and winning on the world stage is one of the most impressive things I\u2019ve witnessed in sport,\u201d Del Duca said. \u201cAnd they do it with a smile.\u201d",

      "The news came less than 24 hours after the botched landing attempt by Texas-based Intuitive Machines.",

      "\u201cThe mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "This was the second landing attempt for Intuitive Machines. The first, a year ago, also ended with a sideways landing, but the company was able to keep it going for longer than this time despite hampered communications and operations.",

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "In the nation's capital, several hundred people gathered at the Stand Up for Science rally. Organizers said similar rallies were planned in more than 30 U.S. cities.",
      "Politicians, scientists, musicians, doctors and their patients were expected to make the case that firings, budget and grant cuts in health, climate, science and other research government agencies in the Trump administration's first 47 days in office are endangering not just the future but the present.",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "Teaching machines in the way that animal trainers mold the behavior of dogs or horses has been an important method for developing artificial intelligence and one that was recognized Wednesday with the top computer science award.",
      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",
      "\u201cPeople are machines. They\u2019re amazing, wonderful machines,\u201d but they are also not the \u201cend product\u201d and could work better, Sutton said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intrinsically a part of the AI enterprise,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand ourselves and, of course, to make things that can work even better. Maybe to become such things.\u201d",

      "A new study says early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "Extinction is still forever",
      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",

    "story": [
      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon.

      "Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Molly Kelly was stunned to discover in June that someone she knew had used widely available \u201cnudification\u201d technology to create highly realistic and sexually explicit videos and images of her, using family photos that were posted on social media.",
      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",
      "\u201cThis cannot continue,\" she said. \"These tech companies cannot keep unleashing this technology into the world with no consequences. It is harmful by its very nature.\u201d",

      "A private lunar lander has touched down on the moon, delivering a drill and other experiments for NASA",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",

    "story": [
      "The Human Rights Campaign accused Newsom of trying to \"score political points.\"",
      "In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is \"deeply unfair.\"",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said on his podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.",
      "Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.",
      "He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "\"I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,\" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.",
      "On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: \"There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"",
      "LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, \"this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.\"",
      "\"Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,\" the organization wrote. \"Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.\"",
      "The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as \"ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.\"",
      "Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.",
      "Two members of the California state legislature, Assemblymember Chris Ward and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, released a statement through the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus criticizing Newsom's remarks as well, saying they were \"profoundly sickened and frustrated\" by what he said.",
      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\" they wrote. \"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\"",
      "Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.",
      "LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.",

      "This isn't the first time Trump has sent a message to Khamenei. In 2019, with the help of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he sent a similar message, but the Iranian leader publicly rejected that offer to talk.",
      "Khamenei reportedly said at the time, \"I do not consider Trump as a person worth exchanging any message with.\"",
      "Trump's comments proposing a nuclear deal come after he withdrew the U.S. from an agreement reached between Iran and the Obama administration during his first term in office. That nuclear deal, established in 2015, allowed Iran to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms.",

      "More than 580 staffers have already been dismissed, with more possible.",
      "Firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will have reverberating impacts on how meteorologists across the country forecast the weather, according to experts.",
      "Last week, many NOAA employees took to social media to announce that they had been terminated after weeks of uncertainty as the Trump administration continues to make cuts at federal agencies. But the widespread firings of meteorologists who make safety determinations based on upcoming weather and climate conditions could be detrimental to the government's ability to protect Americans in times of disaster, experts told ABC News.",
      "NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS), which is a part of NOAA, are responsible for both routine and extreme weather forecasting nationwide \u2013 tracking hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, tsunamis and other potentially life-threatening events. The union representing staffers at NOAA and the NWS told ABC News in an emailed statement that 586 probationary employees were terminated from NOAA on Feb. 27, with 108 of those cuts coming from the NWS.",
      "The National Weather Service was already short-staffed ahead of the cuts, with more than 600 vacancies at the start of 2025, National Weather Service Employees Organization General Counsel Richard Hirn said in the statement. In addition, 500 employees, including 172 NWS employees, accepted a deferred resignation and began their administrative leave the next day.",
      "\"Which means that hundreds of operational personnel who usually staff the 122 NWS forecast offices, 13 River Forecast Centers, and two tsunami warning centers will disappear overnight,\" Hirn told ABC News.",
      "It's unclear whether there will be sufficient staffing left at any number of regional forecast offices to continue 24/7 operations, Hirn said, adding that \"there are only a dozen or so forecasters assigned to each office when fully staffed.\"",
      "The NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory announced on Feb. 27 that the office's communication services would \"be taking an indefinite hiatus\" due to a reduction in staff.",
      "In addition, the loss of satellite operators at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland, and the Wallops Island Command and Data Acquisition Station in Wallops Island, Virginia, could impact the ability of the NWS to track and maintain the weather data used to forecast and provide severe weather warnings, Hirn said.",
      "Many essential functions, such as satellite information, weather and its effect on airplane engine health, come from these offices, said Craig McLean, former NOAA director of research, during a news conference last Friday.",
      "\"Leaving NOAA understaffed will inevitably lead to additional chaos and confusion beyond what we've had over the last several weeks and is going to be a negative impact on people's lives,\" McClean said.",
      "The cuts will lead to significant consequences for weather forecasting accuracy, sea navigation, the fishing industry and air safety, Democrats and former NOAA leadership officials said in a news conference the Friday after last week's dismissals. Officials also expect an early termination of leases on a portion of the 620 facilities run by NOAA across the country.",
      "\"All of NOAA's mission responsibilities have been impacted \u2013 every office in NOAA,\" Rick Spinrad, former NOAA administrator, said during the news conference. \"Every office in NOAA was hit by these indiscriminate, misguided, ill-informed terminations.\"",
      "The terminations come as the U.S. heads into tornado season, with hurricane season not too far behind, Spinrad said. Seasonal outlooks will be impacted in addition to the immediate weather forecasting products, Spinrad added.",
      "\"Musk and his fake officials, the DOGE tech bros, have been rummaging through our most sensitive data without authority in violation of the law for weeks now,\" House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said in a statement. \"And this has come with sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants. Park rangers, firefighters, scientists \u2013 all of these people, whose purpose is to serve everyday Americans, have had the rug pulled out from under them. And we will all be worse off for it.\"",
      "Among the fired scientists were a researcher at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey; a NWS meteorologist in Anchorage, Alaska; a physical scientist with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction; and the meteorologist in charge at the NWS Louisville office, according to posts to social media.",
      "Hirn said the union was aware of up to an additional 800 probationary NOAA employees could soon be terminated following the initial dismissals. Those additional cuts do not yet appear to have happened.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, NOAA and the NWS declined to comment on or confirm the staffing cuts, saying that the agency does not comment on personnel matters, but NOAA National Press Officer for Weather Susan Buchanan emphasized the agency's ongoing commitment to meteorology.",
      "\"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation\u2019s environmental and economic resilience,\" Buchanan said. \"We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.\"",
      "On Monday, demonstrators gathered outside of NOAA headquarters in Washington, D.C. to protest the employee dismissals.",
      "\"NOAA workers across the country are really kind of tense and waiting to hear what may happen,\" Sarah Cooley, former head of NOAA\u2019s ocean acidification program, told ABC News during the protest.",

As ABC News reported earlier this week, a draft of the order calls on McMahon to facilitate a department closure by taking all necessary steps \"permitted by law,\" sources said.",
      "In the interview, McMahon underscored that abolishing the agency is rooted in allowing families the right to a \"quality education\" through school choice.",
      "She mentioned that kids should not be \"stuck in failing schools,\" and that their parents deserve the right to send them to better schools through various programs and voucher systems.",
      "\"He certainly intends to sign the order,\" McMahon said. \"His intent is to provide quality education through school choice to all students, and he wants to make sure that education is back at the state level where it belongs, that our local school boards, that governors and teachers and parents are really the ones that are involved mostly in their children's education.\"",
      "Education is already a local-level issue. The department conducts federal investigations and research projects; it also oversees programs intended to protect students' civil rights and those with disabilities.",
      "McMahon stressed that the department does not create school curriculum and said the agency she has been tapped to lead is not needed.",
      "\"[The president] couldn't be any more clear when he said he wants me to put myself out of a job,\" she said. \"I think there is definitely a role for education to make sure that as we move education back to the states, that we are providing the tools for the governors, for the teachers, that we can provide them with research to show best practices.\"",
      "However, such moves would require congressional approval; any proposed legislation would likely fail without 60 Senate votes.",
      "Congress rarely came up in the interview with \"Fox & Friends\" anchor Ainsley Earhardt, who mentioned a department closure would take 60 Senate yes votes to shutter the agency Congress started in 1980. During McMahon's confirmation hearing last month, she said she would need Congress to carry out the president's campaign promise and vision.",
      "\"We'd like to do this right,\" she said, adding that the department's closure \"certainly does require congressional action.\"",
      "McMahon allies such as Glenn Jacobs -- the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, who is best known as the World Wrestling Entertainment superstar Kane -- told ABC News that choosing McMahon is helping to bring \"transformational change\" to the federal government.",
      "\"If you put a Washington insider in there, you're getting the same thing,\" Jacobs said. \"We're in the situation where we have $36 trillion in debt and the government doesn't work because we've just been going with the status quo for so long, there has to be some radical transformation.\"",
      "But McMahon's critics are vowing to press forward to preserve the department. In a virtual address with education leaders on Thursday, \u200b\u200bNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said that dismantling the agency will harm millions of students in New York and across the country.",
      "\"What [the Trump administration is] doing is saying our kids don't matter,\" Hochul said. \"What's more important is that we slash, for the sake of slashing, and also be able to fund tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. So instead of supporting a math class, they're supporting tax breaks for the buddies at Mar-a-Lago.\"",
      "With scores of education department employees already on edge -- some on paid leave, taking retirement severance packages or scrambling to do their jobs as a department closure looms -- McMahon said she'd like to help any fired federal workers find new employment.",
      "\"Any time there's talk about shutting a department down, the employees that are there are concerned about their jobs, but there are good off ramps for them,\" McMahon said. \"In a country where we right now have over 8 million openings and jobs, I think there'll be a lot of places for them to go. We'd like to help them get there.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the business executive and former WWE president said she welcomed input from the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with scrubbing the federal government for fraud, waste and abuse. She said she frequently meets with DOGE as they conduct an \"audit\" of the agency.",
      "\"When I was in the private sector, I think a lot of stuff is always turned up when you do a good, solid audit,\" McMahon said. \"I welcome the DOGE folks that are in -- we meet with them almost daily. I've been very appreciative of the things that they have shown us, some of the waste, and we're right where we're reacting to that.\"",

      "Musk posted on X that the meeting was \"very productive.\"",
      "The meeting comes as his own Cabinet secretaries have privately expressed frustration about Musk and the mandates he has been giving that have caused mass confusion among the federal workforce.",
      "Despite not being a member of the Cabinet, Musk has outsized influence in the administration as he oversees the Department of Government Efficiency's work to reduce the size and scope of the government. Musk attended Trump's first Cabinet meeting -- at times taking center stage.",
      "Musk ruffled feathers when he posted on X last month that all federal employees would receive an email demanding details of their work from the past week -- a move that caught some in the Trump administration off guard and caused widespread confusion, sources told ABC News. It created tension among members of Trump's Cabinet, as multiple agency heads told their employees to hold off on replying until they themselves were briefed on the situation.",
      "Through DOGE, Musk has overseen cuts of thousands of federal government employees. Recently, DOGE claimed a total government savings of $105 billion -- though the figure remains unverifiable.",
      "Trump discussed the Cabinet meeting Thursday afternoon after he signed an executive order that paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He said it was a \"really good meeting\" that focused on \"cutting.\"",
      "He said he instructed his Cabinet members to \"go first\" and look at the people they can cut in their own agencies, but \"keep the good people.\"",
      "\"Keep all the people you want, everybody that you need, and it would be better if they were there for two years instead of two weeks, because in two years they'll know the people better,\" Trump said. \"But I want them to do the best job they can. When we have good people ... that's precious, that's very important. And we want them to keep the good people.\"",
      "However, he said he warned the Cabinet members that if they didn't make necessary cuts to reduce \"bloat\" in the federal government, Musk and DOGE would take over.",
      "\"We're going to be watching them, and Elon and the group, we're going to be watching them,\" Trump said. \"And if they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\"",

      "In a court case that could very well define the limits of Donald Trump's presidential power, a federal judge Thursday reinstated a member of a federal labor agency, warning of the damage to the country if Trump continues to rule as if he were a king.",
      "U.S District Judge Beryl Howell reinstated Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board after Trump removed her without providing any cause, issuing an opinion that suggests the case could be a broader test of the \"unitary executive theory.\"",
      "\"An American President is not a king -- not even an 'elected' one -- and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute,\" Howell wrote.",
      "Wilcox brought her case last month to challenge her late-night firing from the National Labor Relations Board and she seemingly acknowledged that her lawsuit -- following a \"string of openly illegal firings\" -- might become a \"test case\" for the limits of presidential power. Howell's 36-page ruling seemingly took the cue, offering a broad criticism that Trump's interpretation of his scope of power flatly violates the Constitution and risks lasting damage to the country.",
      "\"The President's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power -- or, more aptly, his aspiration -- is flat wrong,\" Howell wrote.",

      "\"A President who touts an image of himself as a 'king' or a 'dictator,' perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,\" she wrote.",

      "\"The President seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme,\" Judge Howell wrote.",
      "Notably, Howell's decision invoked the \"unitary executive\" -- a theory that the president can exercise complete control over the executive branch -- and suggested the case could become a way to materialize what has long been an \"academic exercise\" about the president's power into law.",

      "Oct. 15, 2024 \u2013 In an appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago, then-presidential nominee Donald Trump voiced enthusiasm for tariffs. \"To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is 'tariff,'\" Trump said. The comments exemplified the fervor with which Trump backed tariffs during the 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Nov. 25, 2024 \u2013 Less than three weeks after his election victory, Trump announced on Truth Social plans to place 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, citing an alleged failure to secure their respective borders with the U.S. Trump also said he would put 10% tariffs on goods from China, calling on the country to stop production of illegal fentanyl bound for the U.S.",
      "Jan. 20 \u2013 Trump signed a memo calling on Cabinet members to \"assess the unlawful migration and fentanyl flows\" from Canada, Mexico and China. Afterward, officials should \"recommend appropriate trade and national security measures to resolve that emergency,\" the memo said.",
      "Feb. 1 \u2013 Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The White House said the tariffs would take effect on Feb. 4.",
      "Feb. 3 \u2013 Trump announced a one-month pause of tariffs on Canada and Mexico after reaching agreements with each country that included commitments to bolster border enforcement.",
      "Feb. 4 \u2013 The U.S. imposed 10% tariffs on goods from China.",
      "Feb. 27 \u2013 Trump affirmed plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico when the one-month delay expires on March 4. He also announced that an additional 10% tariff on goods from China will also take effect the same day.",
      "March 3 \u2013 Speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated plans to move forward with a fresh round of tariffs the following day. Within minutes, the stock market tumbled. The S&P 500 closed down 1.7%, its worst trading day since December.",
      "March 4 \u2013 Tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET. A near-instant trade war broke out. China and Canada each responded with retaliatory tariffs, vowing additional measures. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum slammed Trump's tariffs but said she would hold off on retaliatory measures until after a conversation with him. U.S. stocks extended their losses from the previous day.",
      "March 5 \u2013 Trump ordered a one-month delay of auto tariffs after a request from the \"Big 3\" U.S. automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler. The reprieve triggered a stock market surge, resulting in gains for each of the major indexes by the end of the trading day.",
      "March 6 \u2013 Trump signed executive orders temporarily pausing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement. Despite the easing of tariffs, U.S. stocks resumed their previous plunge. The S&P 500 dropped about 2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.5%.",

Ami Bera of California, Ed Case of Hawaii, Jim Costa of California, Laura Gillen of New York, Jim Himes of Connecticut, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Tom Suozzi of New York.",
      "But many Democrats criticized the resolution.",
      "\"That censure vote was outrageous to my mind,\" Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told ABC News about Green's vote. \"What they've done is they've completely watered down the meaning of censure. Censuring people over heckling. Of course, now we'll have to start censuring Marjorie Taylor Greene, she repeatedly heckled President Biden.\"",
      "\"We know that we've seen Marjorie [Taylor Greene] yell at Joe Biden. There was no outrage. None. So there shouldn't be any outrage today,\" Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett said on ABC News Live.",
      "When asked about the 10 Democrats who supported the censure, Crockett said, \"I don't know their reason or their rational, but I know I voted the way that I did and at the end of the day if my district decides I need to go because I voted that way then so be it. But I stand with Al Green.\"",
      "Moments before the vote, Johnson had told ABC News he took \"no pleasure in making history like this\" and hoped Green would \"acknowledge his mistake.\"",
      "\"I want us to have proper decorum. I want us to maintain really the great tradition of this institution,\" Johnson said. \"And these things do damage to it and I'm sorry that it happened.\"",

      "\u201cI think what\u2019s unknown at this moment is how many individuals are going to continue to go into teaching, who may just have had their scholarships disrupted,\u201d said Kathlene Campbell, CEO of the National Center for Teacher Residencies.",
      "On Monday, the teacher residencies center and the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education filed a lawsuit seeking to reverse the grant terminations. It said the cuts unlawfully targeted several grant programs authorized by Congress.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As Trump pursues plans to dismantle the Education Department, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency already has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \u201cwoke\u201d and wasteful, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "Last month, the Education Department sent letters to over a hundred grantees at universities and school districts saying teacher training programs were cut off because they involved diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives than ran afoul of the Trump administration\u2019s guidance. In a news release, it said the programs promoted what it called inappropriate topics such as critical race theory, social justice activism and instruction on white privilege.",
      "Grant recipients rejected the notion that their work was related to DEI.",
      "In rural South Carolina, one of the grants provided $13.5 million over three years to the Laurens 55 School District. It used the money to create 18 master teacher positions, train teachers, and pay bonuses when student test scores went up.",
      "The program did not include any race-based hiring or teacher training, Laurens 55 Superintendent Jody Penland said.",
      "\u201cI think there was a priority point that kind of included in the grant something about \u2018diversity,\u2019\u201d Penland said. \u201cAnd you know, we took it as in, \u2018How are we going to serve all of our kids?\u2019\"",
      "In New Orleans, the NOLA SEED program used its grant money to help teaching candidates pay tuition at Tulane University. A partner organization recruited local high school students to take introductory college courses and to consider teaching careers \u2014 all to help address teacher shortages.",
      "Another eliminated grant allowed history teacher Brian Grindrod in New Haven, Connecticut, to work with educators across the Northeast to involve their students in We The People, a civics education program that culminates in a mock congressional hearing. When he received an email telling him that work will have to wind down, he said he was angry.",
      "\u201cThis strikes at the core of what education is all about,\u201d Grindrod said.",
      "Grindrod said the civics curriculum he worked on with teachers has been nonpartisan, with a focus on the history and framework of U.S. constitutional democracy. The training helped teachers engage students and apply civics education to real life, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is a curriculum that looks at all sides of an issue from the constitutional perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows students to develop critical thinking skills to look at all perspectives of an argument, to look at how some debates from the Federalists can still relate to today.\u201d",
      "One of Grindrod's own classes had traveled to mock Congress competitions at Yale University, competing against some of the state's most well-funded districts and earning an honorable mention.",
      "Alex Walker, a junior, said it meant a lot to him to go to Yale and keep up with the other students. It was, he said, \u201cprobably the best history class I'm ever going to take in high school.\u201d",
      "Without the grant money, Grindrod said he doesn't know whether he will be able to help other teachers give their classes the same experience.",
      "\u201cThe students are always the ones who lose out,\u201d Grindrod said.",

      "Louisiana authorities investigating the death of a 20-year-old Southern University student say they expect multiple people to face charges in relation to the case",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Multiple people are likely to face potential charges such as hazing, negligent homicide, manslaughter and obstruction of justice in the case of a 20-year-old Southern University student who died following an alleged off-campus fraternity ritual, according to a Louisiana district attorney.",
      "It has been a week since the death of Caleb Wilson, a mechanical engineering junior at the school in Baton Rouge. While no arrests have been made yet, East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore told The Associated Press on Thursday that, in his opinion, it is clear hazing was involved.",
      "Wilson\u2019s exact cause of death has yet to be determined and details of the alleged hazing incident have not been publicly released by the Baton Rouge Police Department or Moore's office.",
      "\u201cThis young man came here to go to school and to graduate in a cap and gown, and not leave in a black bag,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt's a shame that this happened. And it's a shame that hazing continues, despite all the previous deaths we have seen across the country.\u201d",
      "In Louisiana, hazing can be a felony under the Max Gruver Act, which passed in 2018 and was named after a Louisiana State University student who died of alcohol poisoning after a hazing ritual at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity house. In that case, a former member of the fraternity was convicted of negligent homicide and was sentenced to five years in prison. However, a judge suspended all but 2\u00bd years of the term.",
      "Moore said that in the death of Wilson, this will likely be the first time he uses the Max Gruver Act to prosecute. The legislation prohibits hazing, regardless of whether the targeted person voluntarily allowed it.",
      "Under the act, if a person being hazed dies or is seriously injured then violators face up to a $10,000 fine and five years in prison. Additionally, organizations, representatives and officers of an organization, and educational institutions can also face penalties.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill vowed that there would be justice for Wilson.",
      "\u201cCaleb Wilson\u2019s death was senseless - it should have never happened,\u201d she posted on X on Thursday. \u201cWe must end hazing in our State. It\u2019s our job to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of Southern University students, alumni, staff and state leaders gathered for a vigil Wednesday evening in honor of Wilson. They carried candles, brass instruments and photos of Wilson, whose friends nicknamed him \u201cCheese\u201d because of his big grin and his ability to make others smile.",
      "Friends and family took turns telling stories of Wilson, who by an overwhelming number of accounts was joyous, bright, talented and driven.",
      "\u201cHe walked this campus with a purpose,\u201d Chaselynn Grant, a longtime friend of Wilson's, told The Advocate. \u201cI know he is smiling down.\u201d",
      "Among Wilson's passions was music. He played trumpet for the university's famous marching band, known as the \u201cHuman Jukebox,\u201d which recently performed at the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "During the vigil, Wilson\u2019s father recalled walking into his son\u2019s apartment after his death and seeing his band uniform laid out and ready for Mardi Gras season.",
      "\u201cI want to thank y\u2019all for the love you gave my son,\u201d Corey Wilson said to a crowd of people at Wednesday\u2019s vigil, The Advocate reported. \u201cThis was Caleb\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "During the band\u2019s performance at one of New Orleans\u2019 Mardi Gras parades over the weekend, members donned black \u201cmourning bands\u201d across their uniforms and played Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cLove Light in Flight\u201d in honor of Wilson.",
      "In a post on Facebook, the band wrote that they carried Wilson's spirit \u201cwith every step and every note.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was more than just a performance,\u201d the post read. \u201cIt was a tribute, a farewell and a promise that Caleb's legacy will live on.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis setting would starve the engine of fuel and was likely the result of the pilot changing the fuel selector handle in preparation for landing,\u201d according to the report.",
      "The Piper PA-32RT single-engine plane crashed within Nashville city limits alongside Interstate 40, frightening passing motorists. It burst into flames in grass just off the highway and behind a Costco on the city\u2019s westside, about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of Nashville\u2019s John C Tune Airport.",
      "Victor Dotsenko, 43, was the pilot. The passengers were his wife, Rimma, 39, and their three children, David, 12, Adam, 10, and Emma, 7. The family was from King Township, Ontario.",
      "Their flight originated in Ontario and made stops in Pennsylvania and Kentucky to refuel before attempting to land at the general aviation airport around 7:40 p.m. Dotsenko had contacted air traffic controllers and was lined up with the runway, but for unknown reasons he failed to descend for landing. He requested to circle around and approach the runway again.",

      "Many witnesses called 911, some of them still in shock and disbelief at what they had seen, according to audio of the calls obtained through a public records request.",

      "President Donald Trump says he is suspending the security clearances of attorneys at a prominent law firm involved in launching since-discredited opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between the Republican candidate a...",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday he was moving to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at a prominent law firm linked to since-discredited opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between the Republican candidate and Russia.",
      "The sanction against Perkins Coie is the latest in a series of retributive moves by Trump and his administration targeting a broad cross-section of perceived adversaries, including Justice Department prosecutors, career intelligence officials and most recently private-practice attorneys. Taken together, the actions appear designed not only to settle scores from years past but also to deter both government officials and private sector workers from participating in new inquiries into his conduct.",
      "\u201cThis is an absolute honor to sign. What they've done is just terrible. It's weaponization \u2014 you could say weaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again,\u201d Trump said after being presented with the executive order at the Oval Office.",
      "The executive order directs the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and other relevant agency heads to \u201ctake steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\u201d It does not say how many lawyers at the law firm which did not immediately respond to a written request for comment, might have such a clearance.",
      "The punishment arises from the hiring by Perkins Coie of Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, to conduct opposition research on then-candidate Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. The arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, who at the time was a well-connected partner at Perkins Coie and top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign but who has since left the firm and started his own practice.",
      "Fusion GPS in return retained former British spy Christopher Steele, whose dossier of research circulated in Washington during the campaign. The dossier, which was turned over to the FBI for its review, contended that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him.",
      "But the material has since been largely discredited as containing salacious and unverified rumors linking Trump to Russia, with Special counsel John Durham\u2019s 2023 report on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation saying that FBI investigators who tried to corroborate Steele\u2019s findings were unable to verify a \u201csingle substantive allegation.\u201d Steele has stood by his work.",
      "The dossier created a political firestorm in January 2017, weeks before Trump was inaugurated to his first term in office, when it was revealed that then- FBI Director James Comey had briefed Trump on the existence of allegations from the research. The subsequent revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped fund the dossier added to questions about the legitimacy of Steele's research, which Trump as president repeatedly attacked as \u201cphony\u201d and inaccurate.",
      "Trump and his allies have long tried to use the dossier's flaws to undermine the entire investigation into ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. But the reality is that investigation began months before the FBI agents who were working on it came into possession of dossier and was opened based on an entirely different tip \u2014 that a Trump campaign aide claimed to have knowledge that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, well before Russia was known to have hacked Democratic emails.",
      "And though special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not conclude that Russia and the Trump campaign had criminally conspired to tip the election, it did allege a sweeping effort by the Kremlin to intervene on the Republican candidate's behalf as well as evidence that the campaign welcomed the help.",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired Justice Department prosecutors who participated in special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump and said it was stripping security clearances of lawyers who provided legal services for Smith and of former intelligence officials who signed onto a 2020 letter asserting that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The same executive order also alleges that the firm engages in what the Trump administration describes as unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "That follows a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that calls on the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division to \u201cinvestigate, eliminate and penalize illegal\u201d DEI \u201cpreferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has said he wants his new education chief, Linda McMahon, to \u201cput herself out of a job\u201d and close the Education Department",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has said he wants his new education chief, Linda McMahon, to \u201cput herself out of a job\u201d and close the Education Department.",
      "McMahon was confirmed by the Senate on Monday, and an executive order to shutter the department could come as soon as this week. McMahon told employees it was the department\u2019s \u201cfinal mission\u201d to eliminate bureaucratic bloat and turn over the agency\u2019s authority to states.",
      "Eliminating the department altogether would be a cumbersome task, which likely would require an act of Congress.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department\u2019s work.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \u201cwoke\u201d and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation\u2019s academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "The agency's main role is financial. Annually, it distributes billions in federal money to colleges and schools and manages the federal student loan portfolio. Closing the department would mean redistributing each of those duties to another agency. The Education Department also plays an important regulatory role in services for students, ranging from those with disabilities to low-income and homeless kids.",
      "Indeed, federal education money is central to Trump's plans for colleges and schools. Trump has vowed to cut off federal money for schools and colleges that push \"critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content\" and to reward states and schools that end teacher tenure and support universal school choice programs.",
      "Federal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets \u2014 roughly 14%. Colleges and universities are more reliant on it, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.",
      "Here is a look at some of the department's key functions, and how Trump has said he might approach them.",
      "The Education Department manages approximately $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for over 40 million borrowers. It also oversees the Pell Grant, which provides aid to students below a certain income threshold, and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ), which universities use to allocate financial aid.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration made cancellation of student loans a signature effort of the department's work. Even though Biden\u2019s initial attempt to cancel student loans was overturned by the Supreme Court, the administration forgave over $175 billion for more than 4.8 million borrowers through a range of changes to programs it administers, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The loan forgiveness efforts have faced Republican pushback, including litigation from several GOP-led states.",
      "Trump has criticized Biden's efforts to cancel debt as illegal and unfair, calling it a \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d that \u201ctaunted young people.\u201d Trump's plan for student debt is uncertain: He has not put out detailed plans.",
      "Through its Office for Civil Rights, the Education Department conducts investigations and issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied, such as for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. The office also oversees a large data collection project that tracks disparities in resources, course access and discipline for students of different racial and socioeconomic groups.",
      "Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role. Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of antisemitism above all else and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women\u2019s teams.",
      "In his campaign platform, Trump said he would pursue civil rights cases to \u201cstop schools from discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d He has described diversity and equity policies in education as \u201cexplicit unlawful discrimination\u201d and said colleges that use them will pay fines and have their endowments taxed.",
      "Trump also has pledged to exclude transgender students from Title IX protections, which affect school policies on students\u2019 use of pronouns, bathrooms and locker rooms. Originally passed in 1972, Title IX was first used as a women\u2019s rights law. Last year, Biden\u2019s administration said the law forbids discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, but a federal judge undid those protections.",
      "While the Education Department does not directly accredit colleges and universities, it oversees the system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies. Institutions of higher education must be accredited to gain access to federal money for student financial aid.",
      "Accreditation came under scrutiny from conservatives in 2022, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools questioned political interference at Florida public colleges and universities. Trump has said he would fire \u201cradical left accreditors\u201d and take applications for new accreditors that would uphold standards including \u201cdefending the American tradition\u201d and removing \u201cMarxist\u201d diversity administrators.",
      "Although the education secretary has the authority to terminate its relationship with individual accrediting agencies, it is an arduous process that has rarely been pursued. Under President Barack Obama, the department took steps to cancel accreditors for a now-defunct for-profit college chain, but the Trump administration blocked the move. The group, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, was terminated by the Biden administration in 2022.",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools goes through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, lower class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a sweeping proposal outlining a far-right vision for the country, offered a blueprint. It suggested sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",

      "BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Five Democratic operatives in Connecticut's largest city made their first court appearances Thursday since being charged with tampering with absentee ballots in 2023, allegations that led to a court-ordered rerun of a mayoral primary and general election and fueled skepticism about U.S. election security.",
      "Three Bridgeport City Council members and the second in command of the city's Democratic Party organization were among the defendants who briefly appeared before a Bridgeport Superior Court judge, who set their next court dates for March 21. No one entered any pleas.",
      "In the runup to the 2023 primary, surveillance videos showed people on several occasions stuffing what appeared to be multiple absentee ballots into city collection boxes, police said. The defendants have also been accused of illegally helping voters fill out ballots and telling them who to vote for, according to arrest warrants.",
      "News of the surveillance videos helped fuel skepticism about the security of U.S. elections and was used to bolster false narratives about the 2020 presidential election being stolen,",
      "Among those arrested on Feb. 21 by state police were Wanda Geter-Pataky, vice chairperson of the Bridgeport Democratic Town Committee; City Council members Alfredo Castillo, Maria Pereira and Jazmarie Melendez; and Stratford resident Margaret Joyce, who told authorities she worked on Mayor Joe Ganim's campaign, according to arrest warrants.",
      "Castillo, Pereira and Melendez deny the allegations. Geter-Pataky and her lawyer declined to comment on the charges. Joyce declined to comment Thursday. Ganim has denied any knowledge of ballot tampering.",
      "Geter-Pataky and Castillo were supporters of Ganim, while Pereira and Melendez were for John Gomes, who challenged Ganim in the 2023 Democratic primary. Geter-Pataky and Castillo were previously charged with similar absentee ballot crimes connected to the 2019 election won by Ganim. State police allege Geter-Pataky is seen on the surveillance videos stuffing ballots into collection boxes.",
      "Ganim narrowly won the 2023 primary over Gomes and went on to win the general election. But both results were thrown out by a state judge because of evidence of alleged ballot tampering. Ganim won both do-over elections.",
      "Ganim was first elected mayor in 1991 and served 12 years before quitting when he was caught accepting bribes and kickbacks. Convicted of racketeering, extortion and other crimes, he spent seven years in prison but then won his old job back in 2015."

By Tuesday, the last day of the Toy Fair, attendees had their answer, and the talk about how it would affect the prices of playthings grew more urgent.",
      "Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are sourced from China, according to The Toy Association, a national industry group that sponsors the show formerly known as the North American International Toy Fair. Many toy makers are now renegotiating prices with retailers and taking a hard look at their products to see if they can cut costs.",
      "Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said price increases of 15% to 20% are expected on games, dolls, cars and other toys by the back-to-school shopping season. The price range that U.S. consumers are willing to pay is anywhere from $4.99 to $19.99, leaving little wiggle room to raise prices, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s untenable,\u201d Ahearn said, noting that small businesses make up roughly 96% of the American toy industry.",
      "Trump also moved forward this week with 25% tariffs on products imported from Canada and Mexico. Some companies have moved some of their manufacturing to Mexico to be closer to the U.S. On Wednesday, though, the president granted U.S. automakers a one-month exemption from the tariffs on the neighboring North American nations.",
      "Trump's changing statements and policies on tariffs have made it challenging for toy companies to plan accordingly.",
      "Basic Fun CEO Jay Foreman said he didn't rush late last year to get shipments of Tonka trucks, Care Bears and other toys his Boca Raton, Florida-based company produces in China because he wasn't sure if the 60% tariff on Chinese goods that Trump discussed on the campaign trail would come to pass.",
      "\u201cIf you plan in a chaotic environment, you have a much greater chance of being wrong than being right,\u201d Foreman said when interviewed Sunday at his Toy Fair booth. All of Basic Fun's toy products are made in China except for K'Nex, a construction set made in the U.S., he said.",
      "After Trump instead imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods last month, Foreman said he worked hard to persuade retailers to share some of the cost so he didn't have to pass it on to consumers. Now that the import duty has doubled, he said he will have to raise prices for many of his items.",
      "For example, a Tonka Classic Steel Mighty Dump Truck, which now retails for $29.99, will likely go up to $39.99 as early as the fall, Foreman said.",
      "The Toy Association lobbied hard to exempt the toy industry from the 10-25% tariffs Trump levied on Chinese goods during his first term. The group lobbied again this time around, trying to educate members of Congress that toy companies can't replicate the expertise found in Chinese factories.",
      "Ahearn noted there's a lot of sophistication of manufacturing and craftsmanship that has been built up over time over generations in China.",
      "he high skilled and lower cost labor force that is available in China is not available currently, and it will take this same amount of time to build that up (00:08:36)(9.8)",
      "Some toy companies are looking at ways to avoid raising prices.",
      "Steve Rad, CEO of toy maker Abacus Brands Inc., said the company based in Austin, Texas, considered switching to factories in countries like Cambodia or Vietnam, but concluded they don\u2019t have the same level of skills.",
      "However, Rad plans to start having one of its China-made products manufactured in the U.S. Abacus Brands found a Texas factory that said it could produce Pixicade, which converts doodles and drawings into playable video games, at no additional cost. The U.S.-made version is expected to be in stores by August, he said.",
      "His other toys are more complex, Rad said, and he doesn\u2019t see making them in the U.S. as feasible. Instead, he\u2019s exploring whether he can lower costs by cutting some product features.",
      "Foreman, of Basic Fun, said he plans to offer new spins on his existing toys to make them look new. Take Mash\u2019ems, which are soft, water-filled collectibles that feature different licensed characters packaged in small cardboard boxes.",
      "\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll change the color of the box,\u201d he said. \"Or maybe I\u2019ll put it in a plastic container.\u201d",
      "Some retailers already have received letters from toy suppliers announcing immediate price increases.",
      "Richard Derr is the owner of the Learning Express franchise in Lake Zurich, Illinois, and president of the 85-member Learning Express franchise council. He questions if those suppliers are acting in good faith since many of them had sped up deliveries from China ahead of the tariffs.",
      "He and other Learning Express franchisees are studying alternatives to suppliers that suddenly want to raise prices, Derr said.",
      "He said he isn't too worried about customers comparing what a toy costs compared with the year before since 65% of his products are new to the market.",
      "\u201cWe are in the era of one day, one thing, one day, two things, and it changes ups and down,\u201d Derr said. \u201cSo to put out something now, I think, is just preparing the stew when in fact the stew may not even be cooked.\""

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged Thursday to help Puerto Rico in her first visit to the U.S. territory as it struggles to rebuild from catastrophic hurricanes amid chronic power outages.",
      "Noem spoke briefly with reporters during her one-day trip to the island, saying she would look into how the federal government can cut some of the permitting and requirements of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency \u201cto make sure that people are going to get the help that they need and that they were promised.\u201d",
      "FEMA has been funding much of the reconstruction after Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a Category 4 storm in September 2017, but Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez recently criticized the agency, saying it has not yet released $18 billion slated for the power grid that was razed.",
      "Noem said that she and Gonz\u00e1lez talked \u201cextensively\u201d about energy and how the federal government could help streamline efforts to update energy sources on the island. She did not provide further details and did not take questions from the press.",
      "Under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, the U.S. Department of Energy invested millions of dollars in solar projects across Puerto Rico, generating more than 1,200 megawatts of new renewable capacity.",
      "Some $6 billion in federal funds have been obligated to help rebuild the power grid, with FEMA approving 200 of more than 440 projects submitted to the agency to repair and strengthen the grid. Of those approved, at least 125 are under construction.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, who is a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, said she and Noem also talked about ways to strengthen Puerto Rico\u2019s border security, and how the island can beef up relations with federal security agencies.",
      "\u201cWe want to dismantle all those criminal organizations hitting our shores,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said, adding that Noem\u2019s visit \u201cdemonstrates how important Puerto Rico is in this fight.\u201d",
      "Noem traveled to Puerto Rico for a ceremony honoring Michel O. Maceda, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent who was killed in November 2022 during a shootout at sea with suspected drug traffickers. Three other agents were wounded.",
      "Her visit comes weeks after federal agents in Puerto Rico began arresting people believed to be undocumented immigrants, a move that has been widely criticized on the island.",
      "Noem said Gonz\u00e1lez is willing to build partnerships with the federal government \u201cnot only for the betterment of her people, but also for the United States of America. The mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to protect the American homeland, but to do it with integrity and honor as well.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez met with Noem days after traveling to Washington D.C. to push for U.S. statehood, a central goal of her New Progressive Party.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has given the Trump administration until Monday to speed up payment toward some of nearly $2 billion owed to partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to speed up its payment on some of nearly $2 billion in debts to partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department, giving it a Monday deadline to repay the nonprofit groups and businesses in a lawsuit over the administration's abrupt shutdown of foreign assistance funding.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali described the partial payment as a \u201cconcrete\u201d first step he wanted to see from the administration, which is fighting multiple lawsuits seeking to roll back the administration's dismantling of USAID and a six-week freeze on USAID funding, which has forced U.S.-funded organizations to halt aid and development work around the world and lay off workers.",
      "Ali's line of questioning in a four-hour hearing Thursday suggested skepticism of the Trump administration's argument that presidents have wide authority to override congressional decisions on spending when it comes to foreign policy.",
      "It would be an \u201cearth-shaking, country-shaking proposition to say that appropriations are optional,\u201d Ali said.",
      "\u201cThe question I have for you is, where are you getting this from in the constitutional document?\" he asked a government lawyer, Indraneel Sur.",
      "Thursday's order is in an ongoing case with more decisions coming on the administration's termination of more than 90% of USAID contracts worldwide this month.",
      "Ali's ruling came a day after a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s bid to freeze funding that flowed through USAID. The high court instructed Ali to clarify what the government must do to comply with his earlier order requiring the quick release of funds for work that had already been done.",
      "The funding freeze stemmed from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The administration appealed after Ali issued a temporary restraining order and set a deadline to release payment for work already done.",
      "The administration said it has replaced a blanket spending freeze with individualized determinations, which led to the cancellation of 5,800 USAID contracts \u2014 more than 90% of the agency's contracts for projects \u2014 and 4,100 State Department grants totaling nearly $60 billion in aid.",
      "\u201cThe funding freeze, it\u2019s not continuing. It\u2019s over,\u201d Sur told the judge Thursday.",
      "With thousands of the form-letter contract terminations going out within days earlier this month, nonprofits and businesses charge that no actual individual contract reviews were possible, and that the contract cancellations only made permanent most of the across-the-board program shutdowns from the funding freeze.",
      "The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the Global Health Council and other plaintiffs in the lawsuit are seeking back payment for their share of the nearly $2 billion they and other USAID partners were already owed at the time of the Jan. 20 funding freeze.",
      "Lawyers for the organizations told the court Thursday they also wanted to see all of the contract terminations reversed, and future terminations follow regulations.",
      "The Trump administration said it recently resumed payment for USAID debts after the funding freeze. But it told the court that its processing of payments was being slowed because it had pulled most USAID workers off their jobs, through forced leaves and firing, as part of the agency shutdown.",
      "Ali noted Thursday that USAID had said it routinely made thousands of payments before the agency shutdown, and that it said it had recently called 100 staffers off leave to process payments.",
      "The administration could continue bringing idled workers off leave to make Monday's deadline, he said.",
      "__",
      "An earlier version incorrectly said Judge Amir Ali ordered repayment of all of nearly $2 billion in USAID and State Department debts by Monday. Ali ordered payment by Monday to businesses and nonprofits in the lawsuit."

      "State Sen. Colton Moore, a Republican from Trenton, had sought the arrest warrant against Keith Williams, a lawyer in the House speaker's office, after the two men were involved in a scuffle outside the House chamber in January. Fulton County Magistrate Judge Robert Wolf said at the end of a hearing that he hadn't seen sufficient evidence to support probable cause that criminal charges were warranted.",
      "A lawyer for Moore said they intend to appeal the judge\u2019s decision to Fulton County Superior Court.",
      "Moore, one of the state Senate's most conservative members, was arrested Jan. 16 after he tried to push his way past House staffers who were blocking him as he tried multiple times to enter the state House chamber for the governor's state of the state speech. House Speaker Jon Burns, a fellow Republican, banned him from the chamber last year after Moore denounced late House Speaker David Ralston on a day when Ralston was being honored and his relatives were watching.",
      "Before trying to enter the House chamber, Moore told reporters that the law didn't allow Burns to keep him from attending a joint House-Senate session to listen to Gov. Brian Kemp.",
      "Williams put his arms around Moore and shoved him away as Moore tried to enter the House chamber, and the senator fell to the ground. State troopers handcuffed Moore and brought him to the Fulton County Jail, where he was booked on misdemeanor charges of willful obstruction of law enforcement officers.",

      "The station wagon believed to belong to Ken and Barbara Martin was found last fall by Archer Mayo, a diver who had been looking for the car for seven years, said Mayo\u2019s representative, Ian Costello. Mayo pinpointed the likely location and dove several times before finding the car upside-down about 50 feet (15 meters) deep, covered in mud, salmon guts, silt and mussel shells, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is a very big development in a case that\u2019s been on the back of Portland\u2019s mind for 66 years,\u201d Costello told The Associated Press.",
      "The Martins took their three daughters on a car ride to the mountains in December 1958 to collect Christmas greenery, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. They never returned. The bodies of two daughters were found the following year near the Bonneville Dam, but the rest of the family was never located.",
      "\u201cIt's been a high public interest case,\u201d Pete Hughes, a Hood River County sheriff\u2019s deputy, told the AP. After Mayo provided part of the license plate number and other vehicle identifiers, the sheriff's office and the Columbia Gorge major crimes team, along with the Oregon State Crime Lab, arranged to have the car pulled out, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're not 100% sure it's the car,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt's mostly encased in mud and debris, so we don't know what to expect when we pull it out of the water today.\u201d",

      "Mayo began digging up material on the family and used modeling to pinpoint the possible location, he said. Mayo found other cars nearby, which will need to come out before the construction company pulls out the station wagon and authorities get answers to a 66-year-old mystery, Costello said.",
      "There is a road near where the cars were found underwater. Authorities haven't said whether they think they might find the remains of any other missing people in any of the other vehicles being pulled from the river."

    "story": [
      "Fort Benning\u2019s name honored a Confederate general who supported slavery for more than a century",
      "For more than a century, Fort Benning\u2019s name honored a Confederate general who supported slavery. The military changed the name of the Army base in Georgia two years ago, but now the Trump administration is set on restoring the familiar one \u2014 this time for a different Benning.",
      "The new namesake is Fred Benning, a Nebraska native awarded the military's second-highest honor for his battlefield courage as an 18-year-old corporal in 1918, near the end of World War I. The military noted that he later served as mayor of the small Nebraska town of Neligh, but it did not mention that he ran a bakery, opted to have his Distinguished Service Cross mailed to him rather than presented at a military ceremony and didn't discuss his wartime experiences once home. He died in 1974.",
      "Federal law now bars the military from returning to honoring Confederates, but the move restores a name known by generations of soldiers.",
      "Honoring a soldier from the Army's lower ranks echoes President Donald Trump's anti-elite appeals to working-class voters. Still, the circumstances of the change \u2014 and a similar one for North Carolina's once-and-future Fort Bragg \u2014 have skeptics wondering whether their new namesakes are receiving much of an honor.",
      "But Fred Benning deserves recognition, said Andrew Orr, a professor and director of the Institute for Military History at Kansas State University. Benning was part of American assaults on the toughest German defenses by soldiers who fought to take trenches and to hold them, often hand-to-hand and under clouds of poison gas, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you're the town that Benning was the mayor of, claim it,\u201d Orr said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWhat you can do is try and fight back against the stealing of his name by emphasizing this guy earned it.\u201d",
      "The military renamed Forts Benning and Bragg, both established in 1918, as part of a broader effort by Congress to strip the names of Civil War rebels from military posts, roads, buildings and landmarks following protests over the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Trump, then nearing the end of his first term, opposed renaming the military bases.",
      "In 2023, the base named for Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning became Fort Moore to honor the late Lt. Gen. Hal Moore and his wife, Julia, for his storied military service and her advocacy for notifying families of war casualties in person rather than by telegram. The base named for Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg became Fort Liberty and is now renamed for Army Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II paratrooper from Maine.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last month that reverting to the previous names was about \u201cconnection to the community,\u201d and that 2023 changes eroded the bases' legacies.",
      "Benning was among more than 150 fellow soldiers who received the Distinguished Service Cross for their service in the 16th Infantry Regiment during World War I.",
      "Steven Clay, an Army veteran in Leavenworth, Kansas, and historian of the association dedicated to preserving the 16th Infantry's legacy, disagreed with removing Confederate generals' names from bases, and he questioned why Fred Benning should receive such a high honor.",
      "\u201cClearly the motivation is the name,\u201d Clay said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to denigrate what he accomplished. But I think the intent is that a lot of old soldiers like me like the name Benning.\u201d",
      "Fred Benning settled in Neligh, Nebraska, and married in 1926, records and newspaper stories showed. Neligh is about 150 miles (241 kilometers northwest) of Omaha and now has about 1,500 residents.",
      "Benning and his wife had two children, one of whom died in infancy. Their second child, a daughter, died in California in 2013. Phone messages left for people who appeared to be surviving relatives in Colorado and Nebraska were not returned.",
      "Until this week\u2019s announcement, even some longtime Neligh residents didn\u2019t know much of Benning's story. His portrait in a City Hall display for Neligh's mayors shows a clean-shaven, middle-aged man wearing a business suit.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Mayor Joe Hartz, a 45-year resident, said of the honor. \u201cThere are a lot of people who come and go in our community, and sometimes you don\u2019t know what their history is.\u201d",
      "Benning was just 17 when he enlisted in the Army in April 1917, joining a machine gun company, according to reports at the time in The Daily News in nearby Norfolk, where he grew up.",
      "At age 18, he had been \u201cover the top many times,\u201d into the deadly space between opposing trenches, according to the Daily News.",
      "Orr said American troops were advancing \u201cover a sea of their own dead.\u201d",
      "The announcement of Benning's honor said he took command of his platoon in October 1918 after its commander was killed and led its 20 survivors through heavy fire.",
      "Later, he didn't talk about his experiences. In 1928, The Norfolk Press caught up with him in Neligh and reported he was \u201cso busy making good in his bakery\u201d that he wouldn't discuss his wartime service, adding, \u201cMost of the fellows who did the real fighting don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d",
      "Benning and his bakery popped up in small news items over the years. He led the local American Legion Post and Chamber of Commerce and helped plan for a new hospital.",
      "In 1948, Benning ran for mayor, won easily and was reelected without opposition two years later. Before he decided not to run again in 1952, the city started trash collection for $1 a month and improved its sewers, streets and water system.",
      "At one memorable City Council meeting, the Neligh News reported Benning was examining the city night watchman's defective .38-caliber revolver. Unaware that it was loaded, he pulled the trigger. A bullet clipped another council member's finger and lodged in a wall.",
      "Benning sold his bakery and retired in 1965.",
      "While Orr believes the Trump administration is appropriating Benning's service to score a political point, he said Neligh should respond with pride and say, \u201cWe remember him, and we\u2019re going to make it all about him regardless of why other people have done it.\u201d",

      "PLATTE CITY, Mo. -- Two men pleaded not guilty Thursday in the drug overdose deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans whose bodies were found in a backyard two days after they got together to watch the final game of the regular season in 2024.",
      "Jordan Willis and Ivory Carson appeared separately via video from the jail wearing orange jumpsuits. The men were charged Wednesday with three counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of delivery of a controlled substance in a case that gained widespread attention on social media.",
      "Willis\u2019 lawyer, John Picerno, entered the not guilty plea on Willis\u2019 behalf, and the judge entered the plea on behalf of Carson, who doesn\u2019t yet have an attorney and plans to apply for a public defender. The hearing lasted just minutes.",
      "The judge set the next hearing date for Tuesday to consider whether bond should remain at $100,000 cash only.",
      "Speculation about what happened started after 38-year-old Ricky Johnson, 36-year-old Clayton McGeeney and 37-year-old David Harrington were found dead in Willis\u2019 Kansas City, Missouri, yard on Jan. 9, 2024, after McGeeney\u2019s fiancee went looking for him.",
      "With information sparse, the case got attention on TikTok and other social platforms. Family members of the three men took their frustrations to Kansas City-area media, questioning when there would be charges.",
      "The filing of charges confirmed what some online sleuths had long assumed: The three men died of drugs. According to the probable cause statement, a doctor with a forensic lab later determined that the combined toxicity of fentanyl and cocaine killed them.",
      "Witnesses said the friends used cocaine while watching the Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers together on Jan. 7, 2024, first at Harrington\u2019s home and then Willis\u2019 home. The witnesses said Willis had a history of offering cocaine to his friends when they were low on money and that he bought it from Carson, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Willis told police that he believed that McGeeney, Harrington and Johnson possibly got a hold of some fentanyl and that he thought they all left his home around 4 a.m., the morning after the game",
      "Weather records indicate the low temperature that night was around 33 degrees (1 degree Celsius).",
      "Investigators interviewed Carson, who admitted to selling cocaine to Johnson, Willis, Harrington and McGeeney before Jan. 1, 2024, the probable cause statement says.",
      "Picerno said there is no evidence that Willis bought the drugs that his friends ingested before their deaths, noting they had been partying all day. And he has said Willis didn\u2019t know that they were still in his backyard \u2014 or that they needed medical attention \u2014 until police showed up.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very, very long year for Jordan,\u201d Picerno said. \u201cHe\u2019s lost his job. He\u2019s lost his home. He\u2019s lost his friends. The public are pointing at him as someone who essentially killed them. And nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump granted U.S. automakers a short reprieve from stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada this week",
      "DETROIT -- President Donald Trump's short reprieve for U.S. automakers from stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada isn't likely to allow enough time for those companies to make the changes necessary to minimize the damage from Trump's intensifying trade war.",
      "Trump granted a one-month exemption to 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts traded through the North American trade agreement USMCA after speaking with leaders of automakers Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the White House said Wednesday. Trump then broadened the exemption beyond autos for Mexico on Thursday.",
      "In response to concerns about the short timeline for auto companies, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt noted that Trump told the companies to \u201cstart investing, start moving, shift production here.\u201d",
      "It's just not that simple.",
      "Automakers \u201cwill be hit differently based on exactly where their supply chain is,\u201d said John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania. In particular, \"GM and Ford have shrunk back from a formerly much more global footprint, but they still are global companies.",
      "\u201cOf course, if the goal is to move a lot of production to the U.S.,\u201d he added, \u201cI guess you could. But I don\u2019t see those changes happening quickly.\u201d",
      "Automakers responded to Wednesday's news graciously. Ford said in a company statement: \u201cWe will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the Administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\u201d Both GM and Stellantis thanked Trump for the exemption in statements.",
      "Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the three automakers, said he applauds the president \"for recognizing that vehicles and parts that meet the high U.S. and regional USMCA content requirements should be exempt from these tariffs.\u201d",
      "But with only a monthlong grace period, automakers know challenges lie ahead.",
      "To be sure, as automakers spent decades expanding around the world, they frequently battled supply-related woes and policy changes that hindered production \u2014 and their bottom lines.",
      "A disaster halfway across the globe impacting one tiny component, with no easy or obvious supply alternative, can take down a vehicle's production for weeks.",
      "Contentious labor negotiations and work stoppages have put significant pauses on automaking for the domestic car companies.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic also interrupted global supply chains and sent new and used vehicle inventory to disastrous lows on dealer lots, causing prices to skyrocket.",
      "\u201cAt least automakers have seen some version of this uncertainty,\u201d said Hovig Tchalian, assistant professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cI think this uncertainty is actually higher. But they\u2019ve had some practice doing it.\u201d",
      "Those disruptions and others throughout the business's history, however, have made it clear that automakers still can't respond very quickly.",
      "The tariff exemption is no exception, given the ever-increasing complexity of assembly lines and manufacturing. Plants can't be moved, factories can't be built and product lines can't be changed overnight.",
      "And even with this pause, steel and aluminum tariffs are still expected to go into effect on March 12. Then, on April 2, Trump is expected to set broad \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the taxes and subsidies charged by other countries on imports.",
      "Those would disrupt the automotive industry quickly and dramatically, said Sam Fiorani, an analyst at AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "\u201cA substantial change in automotive free trade will hurt stock prices of all automakers because their profits will take a hit and consumers will face higher prices on vehicles, further diluting sales going forward,\u201d he said.",
      "Not only do companies have to decide whether immediate changes in production are realistic, but if they\u2019re unable to do that meaningfully, they might produce or sell fewer vehicles \u2014 sending new car buyers to other brands or the used market \u2014 and, ultimately, make less money.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty that\u2019s being created for the auto industry is going to inhibit investment as firms try to assess what the future looks like,\u201d said Brett House, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school, \u201cand they have very little clarity on it.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-three inmates at the troubled federal jail in Brooklyn have been charged with crimes ranging from smuggling weapons in a Doritos bag to the stabbing last month of a man convicted in the killing of hip-hop legend Jam Master Jay.",
      "Federal prosecutors announced the charges Thursday amid a crackdown on violence and dysfunction at the Metropolitan Detention Center, the only federal jail in New York City. The facility's nearly 1,200 inmates include Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, Luigi Mangione and Sam Bankman-Fried.",
      "Fifteen of the inmates charged were accused in six separate stabbings, slashings or beatings.",
      "Six were charged in a Feb. 22 melee that injured multiple inmates, including Karl Jordan Jr., one of two men convicted last year in the 2002 slaying of Run-D.M.C. star Jam Master Jay. Jordan, identified in court papers as John Doe 1, was stabbed in the back 18 times. At least nine other inmates had wounds consistent with being stabbed or slashed and five, including Jordan, were hospitalized, prosecutors said.",
      "The arrests come in the wake of a sweep last October in which investigators from the federal Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department inspector general and other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies seized drugs, homemade weapons and electronic devices from the Brooklyn jail.",
      "Five inmates were charged with attempting to smuggle contraband into the jail by throwing a rope out a window and having someone on the outside hook items onto it.",
      "Correctional officers caught four of the men last June as they pulled a rope loaded with contraband through the window of their housing area's recreation room, prosecutors said. Attached to it, prosecutors said, was what appeared to be suboxone, marijuana, a scalpel, a phone charger, lighters, and cigarettes.",
      "Another inmate was caught last October with 21 ceramic blades after pulling them out of a bag of Doritos and placing them in his shirt in the jail's visiting room, prosecutors said.",
      "In a previously announced case, a now-former correctional officer was charged with trying to smuggle bags of marijuana and cigarettes into the jail in vacuum-sealed bags in January. Another man, who was not an inmate at MDC Brooklyn, was charged with supplying contraband to inmates after officers in December found a package on a jail roof that contained cellphones, marijuana and alcohol. Inmates were attempting to smuggle in the package by rope, prosecutors said.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons has said it's working to remedy problems at the Brooklyn jail, where detainees, advocates and judges have routinely complained about \u201cdangerous, barbaric conditions,\u201d including rampant violence.",
      "A group of senior Bureau of Prisons officials known as the Urgent Action Team has focused in recent months on bringing the Brooklyn jail back to adequate staffing levels and ensuring it is in good repair. They have made repeated visits to the facility and meet weekly to address issues at the jail.",
      "In September, federal prosecutors charged nine inmates in a spate of attacks at the jail and a correctional officer was charged with shooting at a car during an unauthorized high-speed chase. In October, an inmate was charged in a murder-for-hire plot that led to the death of a 28-year-old woman outside a New York City nightclub.",
      "An ongoing Associated Press investigation has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons, an agency with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates, 122 facilities and an annual budget of about $8 billion.",
      "AP reporting has revealed rampant criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides."

      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.",

      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",
      "\"When you delve deeper into it, and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages, I'm not sure that adds up,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week.",
      "It is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from the US's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.",
      "The US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports.",
      "Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.",
      "\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.",
      "Sheinbaum said she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.",
      "The carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term.",
      "Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.",
      "The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.",
      "A White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.",
      "The White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.",

      "The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.",
      "The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, ended down nearly 1.8% on Thursday.",
      "George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said the \"hokey cokey\" with Trump's tariffs has it made it \"nigh on impossible\" for firms to manage their production lines and is \"putting pressure on the US economy\".",
      "Meanwhile, he said it is \"galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so we've seen a more positive reaction to European markets\".",
      "In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.",
      "\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"",
      "'Numbskull'",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\".",
      "Earlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday.",
      "\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations.",
      "\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday.",
      "Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade.",
      "Trump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada.",
      "About $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.",
      "\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said.",
      "In the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies.",
      "Imports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported.",
      "Gregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.",
      "But Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.",
      "\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".",

      "Only two universities in Scotland, Robert Gordon and Abertay, have dedicated software to help detect the misuse of AI, yet misuse rates remain higher at other universities - with Stirling recording the highest level at 262 cases in the last year.",
      "\"Some institutions are thinking about investing in generative AI detection software,\" Prof Bayne said.",
      "She said lecturers were \"pretty good\" at spotting work turned in using AI, but warned that would become more difficult as the technology evolved.",
      "She said: \"At the moment we are thinking about ways which we can redesign assessment so that we're using more multi-model methods like images, audio and video or more oral assessments or more in-person exams, as other ways of protecting against that kind of misconduct\".",

      "BBC Scotland News met a group of Edinburgh university students who argue that AI serves them more as a tool than a shortcut when it comes to their learning.",
      "Masters student George Karabassis, 26, uses AI to assist with translation as English isn't his first language.",
      "He said: \"If I don't understand a certain question I can copy and paste a certain phrase and ask Chat GPT, for example; 'could you please explain this in simpler terms' so I can understand it.\"",
      "Akrit Ghimire, 18, said many of his friends used AI to help with their studies.",
      "He said: \"Some of the best prompts that they use is 'now explain it to me like I'm a five-year-old or a 14-year-old'.\"",

      "Law student Hannah Dong, 20, said she had come across false content in her use of AI.",

      "The US has been ratcheting up trade tensions, and this week imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods.",
      "Speaking to MPs about the effects of Trump tariffs, Mr Bailey said: \"The risks to the UK economy, and indeed the world economy, are substantial.\"",
      "When asked whether Trump tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers' pockets, Mr Bailey said \"Yes. We serve the people, and we have to take it very seriously\".",
      "Megan Greene, a member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, said there is a lack of certainty about how far the US will go in implementing tariffs, and about how countries will respond.",
      "But tariffs could affect the UK economy in a number of ways, she said.",
      "If there are tariffs imposed on UK goods going into the US, this would \"put downward pressure\" on the UK economy, because firms would find it harder to sell to US consumers.",
      "But that could also lower inflation, the pace at which prices rise.",
      "If supply chains fragmented and had to be reordered this would hit UK growth and push up inflation.",
      "\"Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth\", Greene said, adding that there was a \"tonne of uncertainty\" about how Trump's tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives.",
      "Professor Alan Taylor, who is also a monetary policy committee member, agreed  the risks to the economy outweigh the upsides, and that \"is true for people around the country and around the world\".",
      "He added: \"If you put sand in those wheels [of trade] we're going to be worse off on some margin.\"",
      "Mr Bailey said he agreed \"very strongly\" with the assessment of the committee members.",
      "\"Trade supports growth. Openness supports the spread of innovation and ideas,\" he said.",
      "Trump's tariffs risk economic turbulence - and voter backlash",
      "Trump mulls exemption for some carmakers from tariffs",
      "Bailey called for trade disputes to be settled via the World Trade Organization, rather than thrashed out between the US and other countries.",
      "Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world.",
      "But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world.",
      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",
      "Bailey said the move would be a \"very damaging thing for the world\".",
      "But he said he \"strongly\" welcomed news that the new US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, \"believes in multi-lateralism\", or collectively coordinated action."

      "But it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.",
      "The damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.",
      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",
      "A key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.",
      "If the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.",
      "As it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.",
      "And that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs.",
      "Weaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil."

      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",

      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",

      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\"",
      "If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England.",

      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",

      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last 10 years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",
      "\"We offer Latin to pupil premium students, to children from different sets, abilities and backgrounds,\" Ms Jackson said.",

      "Durham Johnston School is another that offers the language to GCSE level, but as part of the main school day.",

      "Prof Arlene Holmes-Henderson leads a department at Durham University dedicated to promoting the study of Latin and the Classics.",
      "She had a stark statistic to pass on to the Latin learners: \"In the state sector, you have four times more chance of being able to study a classical subject in London and the South East than you do in the North East.\"",
      "She said that means many pupils studying in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall are missing out on the benefits of Latin.",
      "'Unlock literacy'",
      "During a seven-year research project, Prof Holmes-Henderson discovered Latin study made the most difference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
      "She found there were \"three groups of pupils who benefited most - young people with special educational needs and disabilities, students who speak English as an additional language and those who qualify for free school meals\".",
      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School's Latin teacher Cathy Bothwell said helping the disadvantaged is the reason the school has persevered with the subject.",
      "She said: \"Despite the cost of offering the subject, it is that social justice aspect.",
      "\"We have a very varied demographic and providing everyone with access to demanding academic subjects like Latin is a key part of that.\"",
      "There is another divide too.",
      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin at Key Stage 3, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The \u00a322bn black hole we inherited means tough decisions are needed across the public sector.\"",
      "The department said it had \"worked with Classics for All and the Classical Association so teachers at the 39 schools on the Latin Excellence Programme can continue to benefit from high quality teacher training, and so that the small number of pupils in those schools who are due to sit their Latin GCSE this summer get the support they need\".",
      "Prof Holmes-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",
      "\"Durham University has the only research centre in the world dedicated to classics education research, engaging multiple stakeholders on how we can widen access to the teaching of the subject in our schools and communities.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's Eurovision entry for 2025 will be the female country-pop trio Remember Monday, the BBC has announced.",
      "The group, who previously reached the quarter-finals of The Voice, will head to Switzerland this May with a song called What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "Calling themselves \"pop girlies with a little bit of yeehaw\", the band was formed by school friends Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steele in 2013.",
      "In a press release, they said: \"We're going to be the first girlband to represent the UK since 1999, which feels like such a crazy honour. We're going to bring loads of fun, energy and hopefully do something that you won't have seen before on the Eurovision stage.\"",
      "Premiering their song on BBC Radio 2, the band added: \"We feel like we're on another planet. Nothing is sinking in.\"",
      "They'll be hoping to improve on Olly Alexander's performance at last year's Eurovision Song Contest. His song, Dizzy, took 18th place after receiving the dreaded \"nul points\" in the public vote.",
      "He was only saved from last place by the jury vote - where professional musicians and songwriters awarded him 46 points.",
      "What does the UK Eurovision entry sound like?",
      "Remember Monday's song is markedly different from the decadent electro-pop of Dizzy. In fact, it's in an entirely different realm.",
      "Try to imagine, if you can, that Abba and Sam Ryder have teamed up with the cast of Six: The Musical, got blackout drunk and tried to recreate Bohemian Rhapsody from memory. (This is a compliment.)",
      "There are a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts, but with every corner they turn, the band find another hook - with the soaring chorus a particular highlight.",
      "Remember Monday wrote the song with Brit Award nominees, Billen Ted, who've previously worked with Little Mix and Anne Marie; Thomas Stengaard, who wrote Denmark's 2013 Eurovision winner, Only Teardrops; and pop artist Julie 'Kill J' Aagaard.",
      "It opens with a gently strummed mandolin, and a story about the terror and euphoria of being so partied-out you can't remember the night before.",
      "\"Someone lost a shoe, I'm still in last night's make-up,\" they sing. \"I'm waking up like, 'What's this new tattoo?'",
      "\"Room is spinning, ears are ringin'... I'm clutching my pearls like, What The Hell Just Happened?\"",
      "At that moment, the song explodes into a baroque rock opera, all power chords and chunky harmonies, before jumping into a double-time groove that recalls Laura Branigan's 1980s hit Gloria, or Billy Joel's My Life.",
      "Over the next two minutes, we find out more about the band's debauched night out. Heels were broken, strangers were snogged, swimming pools were depth-charged.",
      "\"In my defence it's been a real hard year,\" they protest, before delivering the killer blow: \"You can blame my ex.\"",
      "It's a quirky, catchy girls-together anthem - and the biggest creative risk the UK has taken at Eurovision for years.",
      "But will it be enough to push Remember Monday up the rankings?",
      "Who are Remember Monday?",
      "They're seasoned performers who, crucially, can deliver precise three-part harmonies in a live setting.",
      "They met at sixth form in Farnborough, Hampshire, where they were in the same performing arts class.",
      "Holly had already won a Disney Channel UK talent show called My Camp Rock at the age of 13, which led to her being signed - then dropped - by Disney.",
      "They formed Remember Monday (named because it was the day they had free periods so would get together and sing) and entered The Voice UK in 2019.",
      "Their on-screen mentor, Jennifer Hudson, has remained a champion and invited them onto her US talk show last year, where she predicted they were going to \"blow completely up over here in the States\".",
      "The trio have all starred in musical theatre, with Holly performing in Phantom of the Opera and Les Mis\u00e9rables, and Lauren in shows including Six and Matilda.",
      "Charlotte made her West End debut as Jane Banks in Mary Poppins at the age of 10, before becoming a choreographer, vocal coach and deputy head of a performing arts college. The trio went full-time with the band just over a year ago.",
      "They have a big following and a vibrant presence on social media - notably on their TikTok channel, where they defiantly sing the insults, external that people leave under their YouTube videos.",
      "If they can bring that spirit to the contest, and the pre-parties that take place across Europe in the next two months, they're sure to win over a few voters.",
      "What's their competition?",
      "Remember Monday will arrive at the contest with high hopes, but the competition is already heating up, with only seven countries left to reveal their entries before the deadline of 10 March.",
      "Sweden is currently favourite to win - despite the fact their contestant won't be chosen until the final of their national selection competition, known as Melodifestivalen, on Saturday night.",
      "Among those contending for the honour are 2015 winner Mans Zelmerlow and comedy group KAJ, whose entry Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the joys of a sauna.",
      "The Netherlands, Finland and Estonia have also generated buzz for their submissions - which range from soul-searching ballads to stadium rock anthems.",
      "Meanwhile, Australia is hoping for a reversal of fortunes after being eliminated in last year's semi-finals.",
      "They're sending singer-songwriter Go-Jo, whose song Milkshake Man is a throbbing pop number laced with barely-disguised double entendres.",
      "Malta took a similar path with their song - which plays on the phonetic similarity between \"kant\", the Maltese word for singing, and a notorious swear word.",
      "However, the EBU has ruled that singer Miriana Conte, must change the title and the lyrics to avoid causing offence.",
      "Writing on Facebook, Conte said she was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the decision, \"especially since we have less than a week to submit the song\".",
      "However, she added, \"I promise you this: The show will go on \u2013 Diva NOT down.\"",
      "This year's contest will take place in Basel, Switzerland, after their act Nemo won in 2024.",
      "The ceremony was mired in controversy after participants were caught up in a row over Israel's inclusion.",
      "Protests were staged outside the event, and many artists made on-stage protests over Israel's military action in Gaza.",
      "Nemo later told the BBC that organisers had not done enough to support participants.",
      "\"I felt very alone,\" the Swiss singer said. \"I really hope they have things in place for the next year.\"",
      "The contest subsequently announced new wellbeing measures for 2025, including a code of conduct for participants, no-filming zones backstage, and the creation of a welfare producer."

    "summary": "As she returns to pop with her seventh album, Mayhem, Lady Gaga reflects on the loneliness of fame.",
    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "Playing the Other Stage will release her from the requirement to tone down her set for audiences on BBC One, and indulge in the frenetic, hedonistic club sounds that made her name.",
      "\"The Other Stage is traditionally more of a home for electronic music,\" said Annie Mac on Sidetracked. \"It makes so much sense for her to counteract the Neil Young set on Saturday night.\"",

      "They described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"",

      "But he was so much more than his best-known record. A pioneer of nu-soul and jazz funk, he was a key figure in the 90s acid jazz movement.",
      "Happy and Blurred Lines singer Pharrell Williams has described him as one of his greatest musical inspirations.",
      "Ayers had a huge influence on many RnB and hip-hop stars, particularly in the 90s, with artists like Tribe Called Quest, Mary J Blige and Jill Scott sampling his earlier work on tracks like Bonita Applebaum, My Life and Watching Me.",
      "He also worked with Guru and The Roots. Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".",

      "Ayers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.",
      "Jazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five. Quite taken by Ayers's enthusiasm and delight at the performance, Hampton gifted the youngster a pair of vibe mallets.",
      "Ayers formed his first group while at Jefferson High School, aptly named the Jefferson Combo, and later studied advanced music theory at college.",
      "He became a professional musician in 1961.",
      "He went on to record three albums with jazz flautist Herbie Mann before forming Roy Ayers Ubiquity and landing the hit Everybody Loves the Sunshine in 1976, from the album of the same name.",

      "In his findings, Mark Hobrough, the NPCC's hate crime lead and chief constable of Gwent, said footage from a body-worn camera showed the investigating officer's approach to Pearson was \"polite and carried out in an exemplary manner\".",

      "\"She implied that a complaint would be made to the Chief Constable by the Telegraph newspaper.\"",
      "The timing of the visit, early on a Sunday morning, could be judged inconsiderate, but the officer had already made a previous, unanswered visit and was \"diligently trying to conduct his workload\", the report added.",

      "\"He did not become defensive or challenging and remained calm and polite throughout the interaction.\"",
      "The home visit was reported in the media, the report adds, with much of the reporting referring to as a \"non-crime hate incident\", \"despite a clear explanation [from the officer] that he was investigating an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.\"",

      "Ms Pavlovich first made her allegations public in a Tortoise Media podcast in summer 2024, and was also one of eight women who made claims of assault, abuse and coercion to New York Magazine in January.",

      "\"The more representation and more space for different types of queer artist, it can just help paint a more vivid picture of what the community's actually like and who exists within that community.",
      "\"Having people like Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Chappell Roan and, hopefully, someone like myself, we're starting to show people that we're not a monolith and we vary across the spectrum.\"",
      "Cat, who's previously spoken about her ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses, says she \"falls into so many different groups\" and wants to celebrate differences.",
      "\"I just want to continue to show people that we're just not all one way,\" she says.",

      "Chappell Roan: 'I'd be more successful if I wore a muzzle'",
      "As for why it seems more artists are getting comfortable writing about their sexuality, Cat credits social media as well as other artists that have gone before.",
      "\"Social media has allowed more queer artists to be queer loudly,\" she says.",
      "\"Safety-wise, before it was harder. There's so many icons that have paved the way.",
      "\"I'm really happy that I was able to make a song like Girls!, for it to be received the way it has been and for me to be so able to be open about what it's about.\"",
      "With more artists loudly celebrating the LGBT community, Cat says the fan base now has the opportunity to be loud back in their support.",
      "\"The LGBTQ + community, we're a very hard fan base,\" she says. \"We love our favourite artists down and will do forever.",
      "\"We champion and love loads of straight artists, which is great.",
      "\"But I think it's nice that, in the last five to 10 years, we're now getting queer artists being able to be championed and loved by our own community.\"",

    "story": [
      "Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen.",
      "Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.",
      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",
      "What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.",
      "\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.",
      "She makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.",
      "There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.",
      "\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"",
      "Five things we learned from Meghan's interview ahead of Netflix series",
      "Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range",
      "Meghan Netflix show delayed over LA wildfires",
      "Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business.",
      "It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.",
      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",
      "Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",
      "\"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.",

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",

      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",
      "\"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added."

    "summary": "\u201cKasibba\u201d, who is non-verbal and had no family to speak for her, was one of hundreds wrongly detained.",
    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

    "story": [
      "More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.",
      "The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries.",
      "Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.",
      "However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\".",
      "By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.",
      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",
      "In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.",
      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",
      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",
      "\"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.",
      "Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.",

      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",
      "In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste.",

      "Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents.",
      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",

      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the government's drive to boost economic growth.",

      "A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found.",
      "Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team \u2013 known as the central referral unit (CRU) \u2013 was acting like an \"authoritarian censor\" rather than a public body.",

      "The BBC was alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids.",
      "Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.",
      "The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.",
      "Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.",
      "On another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\" when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.",
      "The software has been banned by Scotland Yard.",
      "Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".",

      "It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.",
      "What is Freedom of Information?",
      "FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.",
      "Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.",
      "The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.",
      "Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.",
      "The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.",
      "The CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.",
      "It said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.",
      "It also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws.",
      "Akiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.",
      "\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"",
      "In 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement.",
      "The so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.",
      "The review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.",
      "The government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.",
      "Claire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"",
      "\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.",
      "The NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.",
      "Chief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"",
      "He said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).",

      "The coaches are already employed by job centres but will be redeployed to focus on tackling economic inactivity, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).",
      "It said the staff would provide personalised and \"intensive\" support to thousands of sick and disabled people.",

      "The coaches will offer tailored employment support to people on health-related benefits and help them access support with writing CVs and interview techniques, the government said.",
      "Ministers hope moving thousands of people into jobs will help them unlock the benefits of work and cut the rapidly rising cost of health and disability benefits.",
      "But the Resolution Foundation said only about 3% of the hundreds of thousands of people likely to lose benefit payments were likely to find a job.",
      "In a report called Delivering the Undeliverable, the researchers argue the causes of the rising welfare costs include the country getting older and sicker and that while ministers are keen on quick financial cuts, truly effective reforms will take time to deliver.",

      "The government described the 1,000 redeployed work coaches as a \"downpayment\" on plans to overhaul employment support, set to be unveiled within weeks.",
      "The current system fails to intervene early enough to stop people becoming unemployed and misses opportunities to support their return, the DWP said.",
      "It has become \"defined by poor experiences and low trust among many people who use it\", it added.",
      "Some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness, the department said.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase on the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the \"broken\" welfare system Labour had inherited was \"failing sick and disabled people, is bad for the taxpayer, and holding the economy back\".",
      "\"For too long, sick, and disabled people have been told they can't work, denied support, and locked out of jobs, with all the benefits that good work brings,\" she said.",
      "\"But many sick and disabled people want and can work, with the right support.\"",
      "Selected figures published from a survey for the government suggest 44% of disabled people and those with a health condition in the UK do not trust the DWP to help people reach their full career potential.",
      "The same proportion believe DWP does not provide enough support to those out of work because of disability, ill health or a long-term health condition, according to the survey.",
      "Some 5,002 people were polled by Ipsos in October, including 1,705 who described themselves as having a long-term health condition or disability that affected their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. The DWP said the data would soon be published in full."

    "summary": "The announcement of new support for courts comes as two reports warn the justice system is struggling.",
    "story": [
      "Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.",
      "The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.",
      "The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.",
      "There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.",
      "Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.",
      "The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.",
      "Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.",
      "She said a cap on sitting days had a \"drastic effect\", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.",
      "A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was \"unprecedented\", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.",
      "\"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "\"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,\" she added.",
      "But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt \"out of reach\" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.",
      "One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.",
      "Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under \"immense pressure\" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.",
      "\"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,\" she said.",
      "\"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.\"",
      "Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had \"accepted\" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.",
      "The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",
      "Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: \"Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.\"",
      "Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.",
      "\"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.\"",
      "Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of \"queues for justice\" were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that the state of courtrooms were in \"a pretty dire way\", and funding was also needed for upkeep.",
      "\"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,\" she said."

    "summary": "President Macron has aired the idea that France's deterrence force could be used to defend of other European countries.",
    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",

      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",

      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London.",
      "It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?",
      "The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.",
      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",
      "And Sir Keir said there would be a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.",
      "Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be \"a force consisting of European and other partners\".",
      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",
      "The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.",
      "The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.",
      "Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly \"to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing\".",
      "This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.",

      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",

      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",
      "\"Clearly the mission can only have achieved a fraction of its science goals,\" says Dr Simeon Barber, lunar scientist at the Open University.",
      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",
      "Athena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.",
      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",

      "And Dr Barber says some of the instruments are likely to have been turned on briefly on Thursday, including the drill and a mass spectrometer that could identify chemicals in gases released from the lunar soil.",
      "That is likely to generate some useful scientific information, he says.",
      "The shortcomings of IM-2 are in contrast to the successful landing of a different private craft on Sunday by the company Blue Ghost in a different area of the Moon.",
      "Nasa wants to send four astronauts to the Moon in 2027 in its Artemis programme. Its long-term goal is to take humans to Mars, using the Moon as a stepping stone.",
      "It is working with private companies to drive down the cost of space exploration, but that means accepting a higher risk of failure.",
      "\"In face of setbacks, it requires a steady hand on the tiller and the vision to see the bigger picture\", says Dr Barber, saying that knee-jerk responses to failures could \"cause damage and delay\"."

      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",

    "story": [
      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",

      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",

    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "The woolly mice had eight of their genes modified: seven were adapted mice genes related to hair growth and the eighth was a mammoth gene related to increasing body fat.",
      "The researchers found that the animals had longer, curlier hair, but no evidence that the mammoth's fat-increasing gene had an effect.",

      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",

      "Apple and the garage both declined to comment.",

    "summary": "MPs have discovered banking services went offline for more than 800 hours over a two year period.",
    "story": [
      "Nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years, figures published by a group of MPs show.",
      "The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data.",
      "It does not include the Barclays outage in January or the Lloyds outage last week - two incidents which occurred on payday for many people, and left customers unable to pay their staff and bills.",
      "The report finds Barclays could now face compensation payments of \u00a312.5m.",
      "\"For families and individuals living pay cheque to pay cheque, losing access to banking services on payday can be a terrifying experience,\" said Dame Meg Hillier, the committee's chair.",
      "\"The fact there has been enough outages to fill a whole month within the last two years shows customers' frustrations are completely valid,\" she added.",
      "Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, she said she hoped putting the data in the public domain would encourage banks and the regulator to see if there was any more that could be done to reduce the disruption.",
      "The Treasury said it was \"grateful to see the Committee's findings\".",
      "A spokesperson told the BBC that the Treasury is \"working with the financial authorities to regulate third party suppliers, as well as considering whether the banks are doing all they can to provide the level of service customers expect\".",
      "But Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT,  says the findings \"once again highlights that the traditional banking sector hasn't kept pace with the investment needed to modernise its infrastructure\".",
      "The findings come as hundreds of Santander customers reported issues affecting access to the bank's app and physical banking services on Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"We're aware that customers are currently unable to access some of our services,\" the company has told customers visiting its website's service status dashboard.",
      "\"We're very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing, and we are working hard to fix the problem as soon as possible.\"",
      "Barclays compensation",
      "The Treasury Committee data looked at IT failures which affected millions of customers between January 2023 and February this year. They found there had been 158 incidents.",
      "While the data does not include the Barclays outage in January, which left one family without a home, the bank told the committee that over half of online payments over the course of the first day of the outage did not work due to \"severe degradation\" of their system's performance.",
      "That family was Emily McAllister, from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, and her children. Ms McAllister and her 19-year-old daughter Keira, who is autistic and has Down's syndrome, had to spend two nights with her sister and one night at a local hotel after their house move was delayed due to the Barclays outage.",
      "Speaking after the committee released its report, Emily told BBC News that she remained in discussions with Barclays over compensation.",
      "She said: \"It should have felt like a fresh start and a new chapter, and it was completely tainted, and will always feel like that, but it is starting to feel like home.\"",
      "Barclays confirmed to the committee that it expects to pay between \u00a35m and \u00a37.5m in compensation to customers for \"inconvenience or distress\".",
      "When taking into account all the information shared by Barclays, this means the bank could pay out up to \u00a312.5m in compensation due to outages over the last two years.",
      "The second highest amount paid out by a firm in that same period is \u00a3350,000 from the Bank of Ireland.",

      "\"For customers, this isn't just frustrating, it can be devastating. When legacy banking infrastructure keeps crashing, customer trust crashes with it.\"",
      "In his submission to the committee, Vim Maru - the chief executive of Barclays UK - said the January outage was caused by a software problem with their system, and the incident was not due to a cyber-attack \"or any other malicious activity\".",
      "\"We continue to work through the impact to ensure no customer or client will be out of pocket as a result of the incident.\"",

    "story": [
      "US prosecutors have charged 12 Chinese nationals for being part of an alleged hacking scheme, which sold data of US-based dissidents to the Chinese government.",
      "The \"state-sponsored\" operation also targeted government agencies including the Treasury, according to the Justice Department (DOJ).",
      "Hackers also allegedly targeted an American religious organisation, and a newspaper in Hong Kong, the statement added.",
      "China has not responded to these specific allegations, but have strongly denied other accusations in the past.",
      "In December, the Treasury Department reported a \"major\" breach by Chinese -sponsored hackers, saying they were able to access employee workstations and some unclassified documents.",
      "At that time, China denied any involvement, calling the accusation \"baseless\" and saying it \"consistently opposes all forms of hacking\".",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",
      "\"In view of Microsoft's potentially important role in securing Sam Altman's re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAI's commercial policy,\" the watchdog said.",

      "\"Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK's merger control regime,\" CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn.",

      "\"This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech \u2013 just like they did the last one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",
      "The same month the UK sided with the US in not signing an agreement on AI at a summit in Paris.",

    "story": [
      "After years of wrangling with authorities, students in Thailand can now let their hair down. Literally.",
      "On Wednesday, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court annulled a 50-year-old directive by the education ministry, which had previously set out rules on hairstyles for school students: short hair for boys and ear-length bobs for girls.",
      "In practice, hairstyle rules have been gradually relaxed across many schools. But some still used the 1975 junta-issued directive as a guideline, and would cut the hair of students who didn't adhere.",
      "The 1975 directive violated individual freedoms protected by the constitution and was out of touch with today's society, the court said.",
      "The court decision this week came in response to a petition, filed by 23 public school students in 2020, which argued that the 1975 directive was unconstitutional.",
      "Student activists have long campaigned for hairstyle rules to be relaxed, saying it infringes on their human dignity and personal freedom over their bodies.",
      "One of them is Panthin Adulthananusak, who recently graduated from university.",
      "\"In the eyes of kids like us back then\u2026 even though it seemed impossible, we wanted to do something,\" he told the BBC. \"If no student in Thai history rose up to challenge the power of the adults that suppressed us, it would be a lifelong embarrassment.\"",
      "In response to such campaigns, the education ministry in 2020 allowed students to have longer hairstyles - but there remained some restrictions. Boys' hair could not cover the nape of their necks, while girls with long hair had to tie it up.",
      "Those regulations were revoked in 2023, with then education minister Trinuch Thienthong announcing that students, parents and school authorities should negotiate their own common ground on what is acceptable for hairstyles in their schools.",
      "But through all these changes, some schools continued to follow the standard laid out in the original 1975 directive.",
      "Schools have traditionally associated short hair with discipline and tidiness - an argument that has been repeated by many social media users this week. But in recent years reports of schools banning bangs or dyed hair have sparked public outcry across Thailand.",
      "In some parts of the country, teachers are known to shoddily cut students' hair during morning assembly to punish them for flouting hairstyle rules. Such practices have continued even as education authorities warned teachers against it.",
      "In January, the Ministry of Education reiterated that it had repealed restrictions on hair length for all students, saying it recognised the \"importance of promoting diversity and fairness in all aspects of education\".",
      "Wednesday's court decision, which also says that schools' hairstyle rules should consider the freedom and dignity of students, reaffirms the official push to leave hair choices up to students themselves.",
      "But Panthin said the revoking of the decades-old directive \"still leaves a hole for schools to set their own rules\". In cases where schools have more conservative management, he suggested, restrictions could remain in place.",
      "Nonetheless, Panthin said he \"felt glad that what I had seen and fought all along was acknowledged and there was a tangible progress\".",
      "\"I hope this court's ruling will set a new standard for the understanding about basic human rights at the school.\""

      "His seventh week in office saw military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine paused, while Zelensky sought to repair relations and a possible peace deal by saying he was \"ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership\".",

      "At home, the US president delivered the longest presidential speech to Congress on record.",
      "If you are in need of a catch up, here are four big items Trump and his team took on this week.",
      "1. Tense relations with Ukraine continue after Oval Office exchange",
      "The dramatic shift in the US's relationship with Ukraine continued this week. Trump administration officials made two separate announcements: First, that America would pause its practice of providing Kyiv with military aid - and then that they had paused intelligence sharing as well.",
      "National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told reporters that the Trump administration was pausing and reviewing \"all aspects of this relationship\", but did suggest that it could be lifted at a later date.",
      "In the meantime, officials said that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered the military to pause its offensive cyber operations against Russia as a diplomatic push continues to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "These pauses could have a significant effect on Ukraine's ability to the fight the war, though it could be weeks until the cut of aid is felt while existing stocks are used up.",
      "A lack of US intelligence may also hinder Ukraine in planning offensive operations, and giving Kyiv advance warning of incoming Russian attacks.",
      "The cut also hit closer to home in the US in Scranton, Pennsylvania - where there is a plant producing key munition that has been sent to Ukraine, and a community with a \"very proud history\" of supporting Kyiv.",
      "Since the Oval Office meeting, the Ukrainians have worked to get the relationship back on the right footing. He sent Trump a letter agreeing to \"come to the negotiating table\"for the rare earth minerals deal and a larger peace agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, European leaders continued to hold discussions about increasing support to Ukraine and bolster their own defence spending, in light of developments in the US.",
      "What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine",
      "2. Confirmed the US would implement tariffs on some Mexican and Canadian goods",
      "US stock markets sunk at the start of the week after Trump confirmed he was moving forward with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada.",
      "In the days that followed, the Trump administration announced that it would be temporarily sparing carmakers from the import levies. The next day, the president signed an executive order that placed a number of other exemptions on various goods - which helped to boost US shares.",

      "He said the postponement of some tariffs on Mexico was \"as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum\", and described their relationship as \"a very good one\".",
      "Though a war of words was evident in dealings with Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the US tariffs \"dumb\", but the country's finance minister said it would hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.",
      "Later in the week, Trudeau said he had had a \"colourful\" conversation with Trump about the fees and warned that a trade war between the two allies would probably continue.",
      "3. Direct talks with Hamas over Gaza hostages",
      "The White House confirmed it had held direct talks with Hamas over the release of remaining hostages held in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study.",
      "Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York.",
      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.",
      "Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.",
      "They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.",
      "Southwest US most affected",
      "Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses.",
      "\"Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,\" Prof Grames explained.",
      "The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection.",
      "Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.",
      "\"Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "She also stressed the need for government action.",
      "\"Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects.\""

      "In announcing the decision to postpone some tariffs on Mexico for another month, US President Donald Trump was at pains to praise his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum.",
      "\"I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum\", he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. \"Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.\"",
      "The comments were in stark contrast to the kind of language he has used for the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who he continues to refer to as \"Governor Trudeau\", while calling Canada \"the 51st State\".",
      "The war of words \u2013 if not yet trade \u2013 continues between Canada and the Trump administration with Prime Minister Trudeau calling the entire tariffs policy \"dumb\" and the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, calling him a \"numbskull\" in return.",
      "The difference in tone between the US neighbour to the north and the one to the south could hardly be more striking.",
      "Some, particularly in Claudia Sheinbaum's camp, see it as evidence of her deft handling of an unpredictable leader in the White House, one who has made several bold statements of intent, only for them to be rolled back or watered down.",
      "Certainly, President Sheinbaum has delivered a singular message from the start: Mexicans should \"remain calm\" over Trump, she has said, insisting that \"cooler heads will prevail.\"",

      "Twice, now, in two months she has managed to stave off the imposition of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican goods through a last-minute phone call to President Trump \u2013 even though he said there was \"no room\" for negotiation.",
      "It is testament to her diplomacy that Trump seems to genuinely appreciate her tone, clarity and overall demeanour in their interactions.",
      "She has refused to accept publicly that Mexico hasn't done enough on either of the main border issues on which Trump is demanding action from his neighbours: fentanyl trafficking and undocumented immigration north.",
      "She began Thursday's morning press briefing by referring to new figures from the US Customs and Border Protection agency which show seizures of fentanyl have dropped to 263 kilos, their lowest levels in 3 years. It represents a 75% drop in the last six months of her presidency.",
      "When tariffs were avoided in February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border.",
      "Her administration has also extradited (although they prefer the word \"expelled\") 29 drug cartel figures to the US to face trial on charges from murder to money laundering, including a top drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been wanted by the US authorities since the mid-1980s.",
      "Those may well have been the measures Trump was referring to when he said the two countries were \"working hard, together\" on border security.",
      "Furthermore, she has often thrown the ball back in the US president's direction.",
      "Where do the guns which arm the cartels come from, she asks rhetorically, openly calling for the US to do more to curb the flow of weapons south and tackle its demand for illegal drugs. The drugs may come from Latin America, she points out, but the market for their consumption is overwhelmingly in the US.",
      "Even when the Trump administration recently designated six Mexican cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\", it seemed to strengthen her hand.",
      "That's because her administration is currently embroiled in a legal battle with US gun manufacturers over negligence. If US weapons-makers have allowed their products to reach terrorists rather than mere criminals, Mexico could expand its lawsuit, she said, to include a new charge of \"complicity\" with terror groups.",
      "And yet while President Sheinbaum is enjoying a strong start to her presidency \u2013 both domestically and in the eyes of the world \u2013 for her handling of Trump, it is worth stressing that these are early days in their bilateral relationship.",
      "\"I think she has played the hand she has been dealt pretty well\", said Mexican economist, Valeria Moy. \"I'm not sure it's time for celebration just yet. But I think she has done what she can in the face of the threat of tariffs. It makes little sense for either of side to enter into a trade war.\"",
      "The key to Sheinbaum's success seems to have been in refusing to back down on unreasonable requests or matters of real importance, while similarly not appearing subservient or acquiescent to the White House's demands.",
      "That is not an easy path to tread.",
      "On some questions \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico being renamed by Trump as the Gulf of America, for example \u2013 she can afford to remain above the fray knowing that most people around the world are unlikely to adopt his preferred terminology.",
      "On others, particularly tariffs, the stakes are considerably higher; there's a danger that the constant back-and-forth and instability on the issue could push the Mexican economy into recession.",
      "The Mexican peso weakened again during this latest episode and, although Sheinbaum claims the country's economy is strong, the markets would clearly prefer a more reliable and solid relationship with the US. Mexico remains the US's biggest trading partner, after all.",
      "When I spoke to President Sheinbaum on the campaign trail last year, shortly before she made history by becoming Mexico's first woman president, she said she would have no problem working with a second Trump presidency and that she would always \"defend\" what was right for Mexicans \u2013 including the millions who reside in the US.",
      "\"We must always defend our country and our sovereignty,\" she told me.",
      "With so much bluster between these three neighbours in recent days, it is easy to forget that the Trump presidency is still only six weeks old.",
      "The new relationship with the White House has a long way to go, with the USMCA trade agreement to be renegotiated next year. But certainly, amid all the political theatre, Claudia Sheinbaum will be more pleased than Justin Trudeau with how it has started.",

      "In reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.",
      "The prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.",
      "Dressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.",
      "Questions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm?",
      "The men step out, to hold a discussion. \"She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour,\" says one. \"She's also short,\" he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement.",
      "They leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.",
      "According to her parents, \"this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita\" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.",
      "The scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.",
      "Savita's protestations - \"I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career\" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.",
      "\"Marriage is given far too much importance in our society,\" Chikte told the BBC. \"Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative.\"",

      "She says she found it \"very humiliating\" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom.",
      "\"I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected.\"",
      "The film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family.",
      "Though it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.",
      "Parents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries.",
      "In the film too, Daulatrao puts up a \"for sale\" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood.",
      "Director Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.",
      "Growing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.",
      "\"As a child you don't question tradition,\" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.",
      "\"This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her.\"",
      "When he discussed the issue with his fianc\u00e9e at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work.",
      "In a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades.",
      "More recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner.",
      "But, as Somalkar points out, \"weddings are hugely glamourised\" on screen.",

    "summary": "As she returns to pop with her seventh album, Mayhem, Lady Gaga reflects on the loneliness of fame.",
    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "\"He was from Hungary, originally studied at the Bauhaus in Germany in the 1920s and 30s, and then when Hitler took over the Bauhaus, he moved to London,\" said abbey monk Brother Alan Reed. \"Eventually, he moved to the United States.\"",
      "The Oscar-winning film \"The Brutalist\" \u2014 a fictional story about a Holocaust survivor and immigrant architect \u2014 was inspired by the abbey's church, thanks to a book written by a monk who worked with Breuer.",
      "\"The link is that the director of the film had read a small book when he was thinking about this project,\" Reed said.",
      "In that book were that monk's memories from minutes he kept of meetings with the architect.",
      "Built between 1958 and 1961, the church was part of a larger vision for the growing monastery that Reed has ensured stays true for nearly 60 years.",
      "\"It was conceived after the Second World War, so both the university and the abbey grew quite, quite a bit in those years,\" he said. \"Finally, it was decided we need an architect to help us plan that.\"",
      "The film is loosely based on Breuer, although unlike in the movie, he was never in Germany during the Holocaust and was not practicing Judaism at the time.",
      "For monks like Reed, having the Hollywood spotlight shine on his Midwestern college is exciting.",

      "In her memoir, the 54-year-old actress reflects on a journey that began when she was just 15, starring alongside Keanu Reeves in \"River's Edge\" before sharing the screen with River Phoenix, Matthew Perry and John Cusack in the films that would cement her status as a teen idol.",
      "\"When I look back on the pictures, I almost can't take in how young I look,\" Skye said.",

      "The actress later married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys at age 21, a relationship that lasted seven years before ending due to affairs Skye had with women. The end of this relationship in particular, Skye said, is difficult to look back on \u2013 even more than 25 years later.",
      "\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"",
      "She said she feels the pain comes from not only hurting a \"sweet person\" but also hurting herself.",

      "\"Hearing his beautiful music was very painful sometimes because it's hard to see someone do beautiful art and think, 'Where is that for me?,\" she said.",

      "\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.",

      "\"It was strange. I was really self-conscious in thinking we're touching right now for the first time and hugging,\" she recalled. \"The sad thing is I wanted more. Yeah, I just, and I still do. I wanted to just see him again.\"",
      "Skye would have another revelation when she was pregnant and splitting up with her fianc\u00e9, designer David Netto.",
      "\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"",

      "TV funnyman Conan O'Brien\u00a0took the stage as host of the 97th annual Academy Awards on Sunday night as the 2025 Oscar nominees competed for top honors.",
      "O'Brien inherited hosting duties from fellow comedian and late-night star\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel, who presided over the Oscars four times before.",
      "\"America demanded it and now it's happening: Taco Bell's new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I'm hosting the Oscars,\" O'Brien said in a statement when he was announced as host.",
      "O'Brien kept things moving in the broadcast and delivered some few comedic interludes, including a musical number in which he sang about not wasting the audience's time.",
      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",
      "This was his first time as the Oscar host, but he has done the honors for other high-profile awards shows, including hosting the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.",
      "Before he became a well-known TV personality, O'Brien was a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons.\"",
      "Who hosted the Oscars in the past?",
      "O'Brien joined an illustrious list of Oscar hosts that includes the likes of Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris.",
      "\"He joins an iconic roster of comedy greats who have served in this role, and we are so lucky to have him center stage for the Oscars,\" said Craig Erwich, president of the Disney Television Group, when O'Brien was named.",
      "Jimmy Kimmel, Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Lemmon have each hosted the show four times, while three-timers include Jerry Lewis and David Niven.",

      "Bob Hope holds the record for the most times hosting the Oscars, serving as master of ceremonies 19 times.",
      "In 2014, Ellen DeGeneres, in her second time hosting the Academy Awards, set a record for the most retweets with a\u00a0celebrity-packed selfie\u00a0that included Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep.",

      "That year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against having a host for the first time in 30 years and didn't have an official host again until 2022, when Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted the ceremony. That show, however, was overshadowed by\u00a0Will Smith slapping Chris Rock\u00a0in the face onstage over a joke Rock made about Smith's wife,\u00a0Jada Pinkett Smith.",

    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

    "story": [
      "One of Hollywood's finest actors, two-time Academy Award-winner Gene Hackman\u00a0died this past week at age 95. And while circumstances surrounding his death (along with his wife, Betsy Arakawa) remain very much a mystery, his legacy is in a class all its own.",

      "\"I think he definitely showed that, don't get pigeon-holed, don't get typecast, don't be just the tough guy \u2013 be everything else as well,\" said David Rooney, chief film critic for the Hollywood Reporter.",
      "What set Hackman apart? \"He was definitely part of a crop of interesting young Hollywood actors that kind of reinvented the mold,\" Rooney said. \"They were getting away from the traditional movie star, into something more approaching real people. He wasn't sort of a matinee idol-look, but it was at the point when people were looking beyond that to try and find some other kind of realism in movies.\"",
      "In \"Mississippi Burning,\" Brad Dourif's racist deputy received a close shave from Hackman's FBI agent. \"I made sure that the razor was actually not sharp!\" Dourif said.",
      "Gene Hackman and Brad Dourif in \"Mississippi Burning\":",
      "I asked, \"Do you think he raised your game in those scenes?\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Dourif replied. \"How could he not? I mean, the better you are, the better he is; the better he is, the better you are. And you're both aware of that.\"",
      "Dourif wasn't just a costar of Hackman's; he was an unabashed fan. \"I never really got over the fact that that was Gene Hackman, you know?\" he laughed. \"Oh my God, this is Gene Hackman! It's so sad that he's gone. But he was a treasure beyond belief.\"",
      "Rooney said, \"He had a reputation for being very tough on sets, very difficult, very impatient with actors who came unprepared. But I think that sometimes difficult is just another way of saying perfectionist.\"",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

    "story": [
      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",
      "\"We need reforms to find savings that can trickle down to the individual, so that these circumstances \u2014 of making what should be unnecessary tradeoffs \u2014 aren't the condition moving forward,\" Lash added.",

      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",

      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:12:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of following U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs, and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, key industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs go into effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could again delay the import duties. And even if the tariffs go back into effect in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston in a March 5 research note.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain models source a greater share of components from Canada and Mexico than others, manufacturers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer, we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means that even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the affect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When will price hikes take effect?",
      "The car buying process is often lengthy, requiring months of research before new buyers can drive their purchase off the lot.",
      "While prices won't skyrocket overnight if tariffs go into effect, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. Because of that, car buyers should start looking now, they added.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "He's not encouraging consumers to make impulse purchases, though.\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about the used car market?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market for better deals, which can in turn drive up used car prices.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law school told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food, you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now \u2014 you'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",

      "Economists had forecast that the economy added 160,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate last month was 4.1%, slightly higher than the 4% rate forecast by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Hiring has eased since December's blowout number of 323,000 new jobs, but the labor market has remained resilient at the start of 2025, experts say.",
      "What it means",
      "The February job figures suggest the labor market \"is showing signs of weakness with hiring across sectors,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",
      "Layoffs across the U.S.\u00a0spiked last month to their highest levels since 2020, led by firings of federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE,\u00a0 outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday.",
      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",
      "\"Overall, this report is a sigh of relief for the Fed as they can continue to sit on the sidelines for the next couple meetings as they assess the potential inflation impacts resulting from U.S. tariff policy over the coming months,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email.",
      "Currently, only about 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed to cut rates at its March 19 meeting. About half of those polled are forecasting a rate cut at the Fed's subsequent meeting, scheduled for May 7.",

      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",
      "She added, \"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

      "Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions.",
      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.

      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process.

    "story": [
      "American consumers could soon face higher costs for a range of consumer products after President Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China went into effect on Tuesday.",
      "The 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico, plus an additional 10% tax on imports from China, will drive up the costs of an array of consumer goods, from groceries to automobiles, and could cause more financial strain for inflation-weary consumers, experts say.",
      "Because importers pay the tariffs \u2014 such as Walmart, which imports goods from China and other nations \u2014 U.S. businesses will shoulder the added costs. While some companies may opt to swallow all or part of the expense, some of the costs are likely to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say.",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "The typical American family could face higher annual costs of between $1,600 to $2,000 due to the new tariffs, according to a new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan public policy research center.",
      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers. But some products that are made in the U.S. but which use imported materials could also see higher prices, such as automobiles that are manufactured domestically but rely on parts imported from Canada, Mexico or China.",
      "Consumers could start seeing higher prices for some products fairly quickly, such as gasoline, with some regions expected to see gas prices jump as much as 40 cents per gallon within days, according to GasBuddy energy analyst Patrick De Haan.",
      "But other goods, such as cars, might not reflect higher prices for several months, experts say.",
      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico in 2023. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. imported roughly $40 billion worth of Canadian agricultural products, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "Subject to 25% tariffs, prices on such products could rise substantially, depending on how much of the cost increase businesses pass along to shoppers. Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",
      "Electronics",
      "The tariffs are likely to drive up prices on a range of consumer goods, including laptops and tablets, video game consoles and smartphones, according to an analysis from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).",
      "Computers, phones and other electronics could see prices jump by 11%, according to the Joint Economic Committee analysis.",
      "That's a reality electronics retailer Best Buy acknowledged last year\u00a0as Mr. Trump spoke about relying on tariffs to achieve his economic goals.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Automobiles",
      "Trump on Wednesday gave automakers a one-month exemption from the tariffs, his spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. The move came after calls between Trump and the leaders of the big three automakers \u2014 Ford, GM and Stellantis (the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram).",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referring to the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated during his first term.",
      "But U.S. automakers would feel the pain if tariffs move ahead given their complex supply chains which can involve car parts crossing borders multiple times over the course of assembly, exposing them to the same levies more than once.",
      "The sweeping tariffs could drive up car costs\u00a0by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, which could dent automobile sales, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some automakers could ditch uneconomical product lines as a result of the tariffs. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Gasoline",
      "Fuel prices could quickly reflect the new tariffs, according to De Haan of GasBuddy. Oil, natural gas and electricity imported from Canada will be subject to a 10% levy that could lead to higher prices almost immediately for U.S. motorists.",
      "\"Some U.S. regions will see price impacts rather quickly, while others will see a delay of 1-3 weeks,\" De Haan wrote in a March 4 blog post.",
      "Drivers in the Northeast are likely to see the biggest immediate impact, with gas prices jump by between 20 to 40 cents per gallon by mid-March, he added. \"For a typical 15-gallon fill-up, that's an additional $3-$6 every time you visit the pump,\" he said.",
      "Other regions are also likely to see higher gas prices, with Midwest drivers seeing an increase of 5-20 cents per gallon and Great Lakes motorists likely to pay about 10-25 cents per gallon more due to the new tariffs, he added.",

    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

      "The new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, plus a move to tack an additional 10% levy on to an existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Those costs are borne largely by U.S. importers, usually leading to price hikes for shoppers.",
      "While Barry said the tariffs will lead to price increases, she didn't specify how big they would be.",
      "\"I think it is fair to say... that tariffs at this level will result in price increases. I think it is very difficult to say given the backdrop that we're in, exactly precisely how big that is,\" Barry added later in the call in response to a question from an analyst.",
      "A Walmart executive told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in February that it would not be \"immune\" to the impact of such levies.",

    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",

    "story": [
      "The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that \"to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\"",
      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",
      "Victory for Trump",
      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",

      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy. Shares of Target and Best Buy fell on Tuesday after the retailers warned of higher prices for consumers due to tariffs.",
      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",
      "\"Last month's reprieve was just a temporary break in the downward trend, because a trade war is something the market didn't believe was possible, so as one (or many) start to unfold, the market will begin pricing in the inevitable damage that will be done to our economy,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the market rout on Fox News, saying that the Trump administration is \"focused on Main Street.\"",
      "\"Wall Street's done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine. But we have a focus on small business and consumers,\" he said.",
      "A \"lose-lose situation\"",
      "China's retaliatory tariffs on American beef, corn, soy and other farm products announced Tuesday expanded the potential impact of Mr. Trump's trade tactics, said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong.",
      "\"I don't think China will buy any more U.S. farm products. The orders will go to South America,\" Lun said. \"I think all in all, it's a lose-lose situation. Nobody gains anything.\"",
      "Anxiety over tariffs is also bleeding into the corporate side of the economic equation. Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",
      "Many had hoped Mr. Trump would choose a less painful path on global trade. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Mr. Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.",
      "After the S&P 500 set a record  last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports  on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. Such pessimism is not unwarranted, according to analysts.",
      "\"Inflation is set to surge as the cost of everyday goods rises, squeezing corporate margins and reshaping supply chains across industries,\" warns Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm\u00a0deVere Group which forecasts that inflation in the US could rise by as much as 2.1%, \"putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain a more hawkish stance for longer than markets had anticipated,\" as a result of tariffs.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-strategic-reserve-trump-bitcoin/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",

      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "summary": "A new study finds that long, unproductive meetings can lead to \"meeting hangovers,\" affecting workflow and productivity.",
    "story": [
      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

      "Lee Dudek, the acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration, is facing questions about his appointment to the role from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who serves on the Senate's Finance Committee.",
      "In a March 2 letter to Dudek, Warren highlights a LinkedIn post from before his appointment as acting commissioner, in which he wrote that he had \"bullied agency executives\" to help the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting effort. Dudek added that he shared executive contact information and \"moved contractor money around\" to add resources to his anti-fraud team, according to Warren's letter.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The post, which has since been deleted from LinkedIn, suggests that Dudek may \"have acted against agency policy \u2014 or even illegally \u2014 to facilitate DOGE's efforts to access SSA systems,\" Warren wrote in the letter. Since being appointed as acting commissioner, Dudek has announced a significant restructuring of the agency, including cutting 7,000 jobs, or about 12% of its workforce, which current employees say could hamper\u00a0its mission to provide retirement and disability benefits to almost 70 million Americans.",
      "\"The circumstances of your appointment raise questions about the truthfulness of President Trump's assertion that 'Social Security will not be touched [by DOGE],'\" Warren wrote in the letter. DOGE has \"launched an attack on the agency, closing at least 10 local offices,\u00a0firing scores of personnel and gaining access to SSA internal systems.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "Asked if the dramatic change stems from new policies out of Washington, D.C., Herrera said, \"It has a lot to do with that.\"",
      "Citing muscular presidential powers, Mr. Trump has effectively shut down the American asylum system, allowing U.S. border agents to swiftly expel migrants under the legal premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\" He has also deployed thousands of additional troops to the U.S. southern border and tasked the military with carrying out deportations.",
      "During that recent ride-along with Border Patrol in the El Paso sector, CBS News cameras captured a heavily fortified U.S. border, spotting Border Patrol agents, soldiers, vehicles and barriers. But there were no migrants in sight.",
      "Mr. Trump's crackdown was also on full display when CBS News traveled to the other side of the border.",
      "At a shelter in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Eduardo Medina and his wife Joanna Cortes described how they had brought their three children to northern Mexico last year after fleeing the high levels of crime and violence in the southern state of Michoac\u00e1n.",

NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",

      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",

      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Vice President Kamala Harris will decide whether she will run for governor of California in 2026 by the end of summer, a person familiar with her decision-making process said.",
      "Term limits prevent current California Gov. Gavin Newsom from running again, and the election to replace him will take place next year. Politico first reported the timing on Harris' self-imposed deadline to decide whether to run. Candidates have until early March 2026 to file paperwork ahead of the June 2, 2026, primary.",
      "Another source familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News that she is \"seriously considering\" a run for governor. A gubernatorial bid would likely mean she would not run for president in 2028, which she is also considering.",
      "The field to replace Newsom, who has been governor since 2019, is expected to be sizable, but Harris' entry into the race could dissuade other Democrats from launching bids of their own.",
      "A former Harris adviser said \"she'd be great,\" and has already proven she could lead at the national level and as California attorney general.",
      "\"On a national level, what Newsom has been able to do with that job, there is a lot of upside with what she can do as the governor of the fifth-largest economy with her name ID, when our party is looking for national leadership and California looking for good governance \u2014 especially at a time when California is going through a lot,\" the former adviser said.",
      "Harris, 60, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since her November loss to President Trump. Following the election, Harris and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff first headed back to California, while she took time to decide her next move. Her primary residence is in Los Angeles. As of January, multiple sources said she was expected to work on books about her time in politics and her interest in food and cooking. But discussions were already underway among her allies about a possible run for governor.",

    "summary": "Among the CISA cuts were top recruits tasked with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic cyber attacks.",
    "story": [
      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort\u00a0to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",
      "To help assist fired employers at her former agency, Easterly has created a matching website to connect former CISA alumni and prospective employers.",
      "For his part, Thompson has started a hotline to encourage fired employees at the Department of Homeland Security and its components to share their stories.",
      "After the Trump administration tapped the Office of Personnel Management to fire federal employees en masse, a federal judge temporarily blocked it, citing OPM's lack of authority to fire employees at other agencies. This week, OPM updated its guidance to reflect that firing decisions are made by individual departments and agencies, spurring the rehiring or reinstatement of batches of fired workers in the weeks since. CISA has yet to follow suit.",
      "Asked if she'd return to the agency, Shaw paused. \"I would have to go back,\" she finally said, citing CISA's essential mission and a regular paycheck. \"I mean, they'd have to earn my trust back. But I don't know how you do that.\"",

    "summary": "Hampton Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes after a federal appeals court cleared the way for his firing by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hampton Dellinger, the former head of the office that investigates whistleblower retaliation, has dropped his legal challenge to his firing by President Trump from his role as special counsel.",
      "Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes hours after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Mr. Trump to terminate him as leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "The D.C. Circuit granted a request from the president to halt a lower court order that blocked Dellinger's firing. The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, sided with the former special counsel in his challenge to his removal and said in a ruling Saturday that he must remain in the role.",
      "Dellinger's decision to walk away from the case cuts off its path to the Supreme Court, which has in a pair of recent decisions reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will.",
      "In a letter\u00a0filed Thursday, lawyers for Dellinger told the D.C. Circuit Court that he decided to no longer pursue judicial relief. They said they are still in talks with the federal government over the next steps to bring the litigation to a close, but wrote \"Dellinger's final and public decision means that there is presently no live appeal for this court to address.\"",
      "\"I'm stopping the fight because, yesterday, circuit court judges reviewing the trial court decision in my favor granted the government's request that I be removed from office while the case continues,\" Dellinger wrote in a statement obtained by CBS News. \"This new ruling means that OSC will be run by someone totally beholden to the president for the months that would pass before I could get a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "The ethics watchdog warned that the harm to those dependent on the agency under a future special counsel sympathetic to the Trump administration \"could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.\"",
      "\"I think the circuit judges erred badly because their willingness to sign off on my ouster \u2014 even if presented as possibly temporary \u2014 immediately erases the independence Congress provided for my position, a vital protection that has been accepted as lawful for nearly fifty years. Until now,\" Dellinger said. \"And given the circuit court's adverse ruling, I think my odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.\"",
      "The Justice Department, though, called Dellinger's assertion that there is no longer a live issue before the D.C. Circuit \"plainly incorrect\" because the government is subject to a permanent injunction issued by the district court Saturday. That injunction needs to be dissolved and Dellinger's complaint dismissed in order for the appeal to become moot, it said.",
      "Dellinger continued to take numerous actions under the scope of his former role while the legal battle over his firing played out. He petitioned against the Trump administration's recent mass firings of federal workers\u00a0and, on Tuesday, argued to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative system for federal workers to appeal employment issues, that the Department of Agriculture's firing of over 5,000 probationary workers violated civil service protections.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But on Feb. 7, he received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, Jackson ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel while she considered his request for longer relief.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute during the earlier stages and greenlight the president's firing of Dellinger. But last month, the high court declined to immediately step into the fight and instead put off a decision while the proceedings before the district court moved forward.",
      "Then, on Saturday, Jackson ruled in favor of Dellinger and rejected the Trump administration's claim that the removal protections laid out in the Civil Service Reform Act were unconstitutional.",
      "The Justice Department again sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit, which granted its request to halt the district court's ruling while it considered the appeal.",
      "\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the unsigned order from the three-judge panel said.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, actions that have sparked legal challenges.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, to be reinstated earlier this month. The Justice Department has appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit. Another district judge on Thursday ruled Mr. Trump's firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox   was unlawful.",
      "Thousands of federal workers deemed probationary have been laid off after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to stop the firings, and the White House personnel and budget offices have told agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "A federal judge in California last month\u00a0found that the mass terminations are likely illegal in a separate case brought by labor unions and nonprofit organizations.",
      "Separately, roughly 75,000 workers accepted Mr. Trump's offer to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30 through a \"deferred resignation\" program.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

      "Washington \u2014 References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.",
      "One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public, said the purge could delete as many as 100,000 images or posts in total, when considering social media pages and other websites that are also being culled for DEI content. The official said it's not clear if the database has been finalized.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Trump's executive order ending those programs across the federal government.",
      "",
      "The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months - such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.",
      "But a review of the database also underscores the confusion that has swirled among agencies about what to remove following Mr. Trump's order.",
      "In some cases, photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word \"gay,\" including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.",
      "Several photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion, apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list, seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish - including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.",
      "In addition, some photos of the Tuskegee Airmen, the nation's first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit, were listed on the database, but those may be protected due to historical content.",
      "The Air Force briefly removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen soon after the president's order. That drew the White House's ire over \"malicious compliance,\" and the Air Force quickly reversed the removal.",
      "Many of the images listed in the database already have been removed. Others were still visible Thursday, and it's not clear if they will be taken down at some point or be allowed to stay, including images with historical significance such as those of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "Asked about the database, Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement, \"We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.\"",
      "He noted that Hegseth has declared that \"DEI is dead\" and that efforts to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs erodes camaraderie and threatens mission execution.",
      "In some cases, the removal was partial. The main page in a post titled \"Women's History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters\" was removed. But at least one of the photos in that collection about an all-female C-17 crew could still be accessed. A shot from the Army Corps of Engineers titled \"Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month\" was deleted.",
      "Other photos flagged in the database but still visible Thursday included images of the World War II Women Air Service Pilots and one of U.S. Air Force Col. Jeannie Leavitt, the country's first female fighter pilot.",
      "Also still visible was an image of then-Pfc. Christina Fuentes Montenegro becoming one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps' Infantry Training Battalion and an image of Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves.",
      "It was unclear why some other images were removed, such as a Marine Corps photo titled \"Deadlift contenders raise the bar pound by pound\" or a National Guard website image called \"Minnesota brothers reunite in Kuwait.\"",
      "The database of the 26,000 images was created to conform with federal archival laws, so if the services are queried in the future, they can show how they are complying with the law, the U.S. official said. But it may be difficult to ensure the content was archived because the responsibility to ensure each image was preserved was the responsibility of each individual unit.",
      "In many cases, workers are taking screenshots of the pages marked for removal, but it would be difficult to restore them if that decision was made, according to another official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that were not public.",
      "A Marine Corps official said every one of its images in the database \"either has been taken down or will be taken down.\" The Marines are moving on the directive as fast as possible, but as with the rest of the military, very few civilian or contractor employees at the Pentagon can perform content removal, the official said.",
      "In the Marine Corps, just one defense civilian is available to do the work. The Marine Corps estimates that person has identified at least 10,000 images for removal - and that does not count more than 1,600 social media sites that have not yet been addressed.",
      "Many of those social media sites were military base or unit support groups created years ago and left idle. No one still has the administrative privileges to go in and change the content.",
      "The Marine official said the service is going through each site and getting new administrative privileges so it can make the changes.",
      "On Feb. 26, the Pentagon ordered all the military services to spend countless hours poring over years of website postings, photos, news articles and videos to remove any mentions that \"promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\"",
      "If they couldn't do that by Wednesday, they were told to \"temporarily remove from public display\" all content published during the Biden administration's four years in office.",

      "Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.",
      "In many cases, it is not.",
      "The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end \"the mass poisoning of American children.\" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Martin Makary, President Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods \"with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.\"",
      "\"These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,\" he said.",
      "But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.",
      "To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.",

      "\"The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,\" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.",

      "Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.",
      "KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers \u2014 The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondel\u0113z International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and Unilever \u2014 for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.",
      "None provided answers to those questions.",
      "\"We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,\" Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.",
      "Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.",
      "Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.",
      "Potentially harmful ingredients \"are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,\" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.",
      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says he's suspending security clearances of lawyers at Perkins Coie, which was involved in launching oppo research during the 2016 campaign into any ties between Trump and Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he was moving to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia.",
      "The sanction against Perkins Coie is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Trump and his administration to target a broad cross-section of perceived adversaries, including Justice Department prosecutors, career intelligence officials and, most recently, private-practice attorneys.",
      "\"This is an absolute honor to sign. What they've done is just terrible. It's weaponization \u2014 you could say weaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again,\" Mr. Trump said as he prepared to sign the executive order in the Oval Office.",
      "The order directs the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and other relevant agency heads to \"take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" It does not specify how many lawyers at the law firm would be subject to losing their clearances.",
      "It also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by attorneys at the firm \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the firm said, \"We have reviewed the Executive Order. It is patently unlawful, and we intend to challenge it.\"",
      "The punishment arises from the hiring by Perkins Coie of Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, to conduct opposition research on then-candidate Trump's potential ties to Russia. The arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, who at the time was a well-connected partner at Perkins Coie and top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, but who has since left the firm and started his own practice.",
      "Fusion GPS in return retained former British spy Christopher Steele, whose dossier of research circulated among journalists and government officials in Washington during the campaign. The dossier, which was turned over to the FBI for its review, contended that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him.",
      "But the material has since been largely discredited as containing salacious and unverified rumors linking Trump to Russia, with special counsel John Durham's 2023 report on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation saying that FBI investigators who tried to corroborate Steele's findings were unable to verify a \"single substantive allegation.\" Steele has stood by his work.",
      "The dossier created a political firestorm in January 2017, when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had briefed Trump before he took office on the existence of allegations from the research. The subsequent revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped fund the dossier added to questions about the legitimacy of Steele's research, which Trump as president repeatedly attacked as \"phony\" and inaccurate.",
      "Trump and his allies have long tried to use the dossier's flaws to undermine the entire investigation into connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. But the investigation began weeks before the FBI agents who were working on it came into possession of dossier and was opened based on an entirely different tip \u2014 that a Trump campaign aide claimed to have knowledge that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, well before Russia was known to have hacked Democratic emails.",
      "And though special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not conclude that Russia and the Trump campaign had criminally conspired to tip the election, it did identify a sweeping effort by the Kremlin to intervene on the Republican candidate's behalf, as well as evidence that the campaign welcomed the help.",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired Justice Department prosecutors who participated in special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump. It also said it was stripping security clearances of lawyers who provided legal services for Smith and of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed onto a 2020 letter asserting that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The Perkins Coie executive order also alleges that the firm engages in what the Trump administration describes as unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "That follows a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that calls on the Justice Department's civil rights division to \"investigate, eliminate and penalize illegal\" DEI \"preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\"",

    "story": [
      "Houston, Texas \u2014 The Trump administration is reviving the controversial practice of detaining migrant families with children in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, the latest front in its effort to carry out a deportation effort the president has promised will be the largest in U.S. history.",
      "ICE on Thursday was detaining the first group of migrant parents and children in a detention facility in Texas designed to hold families with minors, according to an internal government report obtained by CBS News. The group includes three children, the report shows.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants have deportation orders and confirmed the Trump administration is refitting two Texas immigration detention centers to hold families who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"We aren't going to ignore the rule of law,\" McLaughlin told CBS News.",
      "The Karnes detention facility is located in Karnes City, Texas, a small town east of San Antonio. The other ICE detention center equipped to house families with minor children is located in Dilley, Texas, another small town south of San Antonio. The Biden administration used those sites to detain migrant adults.",
      "The move by the Trump administration reverses a policy change by the Biden administration, which discontinued the long-term detention of migrant families. It's a practice that was first implemented on a large-scale by the Obama administration, in an attempt to discourage families from crossing the southern border illegally.",
      "Advocates and child welfare experts have long denounced family detention, saying it is harmful to children and their psychological well-being. A 2016 report commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security called for family immigration detention to be phased out.",
      "\"There is no safe way to detain families and no legitimate justification for this inhumane practice,\" said Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center of Youth Law representing migrant children in a federal court case.",
      "The U.S. government has long faced legal, humanitarian and operational challenges when processing migrant parents and children who are in the country without legal permission. In 2015, for example, a federal judge ruled that the government should generally not hold migrant children for longer than 20 days, dramatically limiting family detention in the immigration context.",

      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, says Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",
      "The intelligence the U.S. has been sharing has been critical in helping Ukraine strike Russian military targets, as well as anticipate and block Russian attacks.",
      "\"But it's a pause. It's not an end,\" Kellogg told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan in an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations Thursday. \"But it's sort of of like, okay, we're trying to get your attention.\"",
      "\"That's a pretty major concession to Russia, to constrain Ukraine's ability to target and hit Russian forces,\" Brennan said, pointing out, \"this pressure really seems to be directly impacting, potentially, what they can do on the battlefield.\"",
      "\"Very candidly, they brought it on themselves,\" Kellogg responded, to hisses from the audience.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe acknowledged the intelligence sharing pause Wednesday, a move that followed the contentious White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday. The meeting with President Trump was supposed to culminate in the signing of a rare earth minerals deal but instead ended in recrimination, as Zelenskyy sought to remind the president and Vice President JD Vance of the treaties Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken in the past, while Mr. Trump and Vance berated the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, accusing him of not saying \"thank you\" for U.S. military aid.",
      "Though Kellogg indicated that intelligence sharing could resume, he declined to say when. \"That's up to the president of the United States,\" he told Brennan.",
      "Kellogg also said the Trump administration would be willing to work with Zelenskyy once the minerals agreement is finalized.",
      "\"Sign a document, and then once you sign the document that you want to go forward, that you're serious about it, then I think you can move forward,\" said Kellogg. \"When I was in Kyiv two weeks ago, I was very clear to President Zelenskyy \u2014 the outcome if we didn't have a signed agreement.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now likely to be the administration official who signs the deal with Ukraine. And next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff expects to meet with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he told reporters Thursday.",
      "Witkoff met with Putin for about three and a half hours last month in Russia and returned to the U.S. with \"an indication of where the Russians are\" on peace negotiations, Kellogg said.",
      "\"We want to do the same thing with the Ukrainians, as well,\" Kellogg told Brennan.",
      "Notably, Kellogg denied an earlier statement by Witkoff that the Istanbul protocol, drafted shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, could serve as the basis for a peace deal framework between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "The right-leaning Institute for the Study of War describes the Istanbul protocol as \"entirely incompatible with the current stated U.S. policy\" and argues it \"cannot be the basis or guidepost for negotiations that amount to anything other than capitulation to Russia's pre-war demands.\"",
      "The institute noted that a draft of that agreement would have had Ukraine surrender its sovereignty and would have prevented it from maintaining armed forces sufficient to deter a Russian attack.",
      "\"Steve said it's a departure point. I think that's a good word to use,\" said Kellogg. \"I don't believe for all of us that that is an equitable framework. And I think we have to develop something entirely new,\" he continued.",
      "\"I think Steve made a comment as a general comment, and it is not the Trump administration policy\u00a0 because they haven't made their policy,\" he added.",
      "At this point, Kellogg estimates that the Ukrainians should have enough military aid to continue fighting through the summer.",
      "\"They have an ability with the assets they've got to continue to prosecute the fight, to do it,\" said Kellogg.",
      "Kellogg would not confirm that as part of a peace agreement the U.S. would backstop any European peacekeeping forces by providing security guarantees to Ukraine.",
      "\"That's part of the discussion we're having with the Europeans as well \u2014 when you talk what does [a] backstop look like,\" said Kellogg.",
      "\"What does that look like on the economic side, what do sanctions look like, what do frozen assets, whatever it's going to be? And then we also look at the military side as well,\" he said.",
      "Beyond bringing the conflict to a close, Kellogg also said president seeks a \"reset\" of U.S. relations with Russia.",
      "\"The need to reset relations with Russia to secure Americans' vital national interest, and ultimately, to stop U.S. entanglement in an endless proxy war, are the driving reasons why President Trump's approach and the framing of this war is distinct from the broader, conventional approach that we see publicly to the war,\" said Kellogg.",
      "He acknowledged, however, that existing sanctions against Russia need to be enforced more aggressively to be more effective.",
      "If you ranked U.S. sanctions against Russia on a scale of 1 to 7, he said, \"the problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a 3.\"",
      "\"I think the most important thing is the enforcement of sanctions \u2014 not necessarily the sanctions themselves,\" he added.",

    "summary": "As Russia bombs Ukraine and Trump pushes Zelenskyy for a \"better deal,\" what will it take to end the war Vladimir Putin started?",
    "story": [
      "The CIA chief confirmed Wednesday that the Trump administration had paused not only the flow of military hardware and financial support to Ukraine, but also vital intelligence gathering that has helped Kyiv anticipate and block incoming missile and drone attacks and effectively target Russia's invading forces. The U.S. military's European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on their way \u2014 approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered \u2014 have been paused.",
      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",
      "\"The best way I can describe it is like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across their noses \u2014 we got their attention,\" he said. \"But it's a pause, it's not an end. It's then up to them.\"",
      "Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming. I told them.\"",
      "\"If you take away support like that, of course it's important,\" said Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that's why it was done.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said Vladimir Putin will also have to make concessions to bring about a ceasefire, but those have not been outlined by the White House to date. To even engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S. access to a major share of Ukraine's mineral resources.",
      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Zelenskyy's dressing-down at the White House, Ukrainian officials \u2014 including Zelenskyy himself \u2014 made it clear they were\u00a0still willing to sign an economic agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called Macron's remarks \"a threat to Russia,\" while dismissing European suggestions that it is in fact Russia which poses a threat to security on the continent, calling that \"stupid\" and \"delirious nonsense.\"",
      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",
      "As Europe grapples over how to ensure its own defense from future Russian or other threats, Ukrainians will be hoping the continent's leaders move quickly to boost their own defenses against Russia's current, ongoing assault.",
      "France was quick to confirm it would continue sharing its intelligence with Ukraine after the U.S. cutoff, with Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu saying: \"Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that all the great... warm political will of the European nations will also, as urgently as possible, will translate in upscaling their defense engagement with Ukraine,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News. \"They've given a lot. They have much more limited capacities than the United States, but we hope that they will be able to invest in Ukrainian defense capacities, that they will be able to upscale their defense production, that they will help us also to procure weaponry in order for us to stay strong while Russia has not given up on their plans to just destroy us.\"",
      "She made it clear that Ukraine would also continue working toward an agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are to try to get the message across to the American public. I think that this is also very important, and I'm sure that President Trump really cares about the support that he enjoys back in the United States, and I hope that he hears also his citizens [saying] why this is important, and why it is expected that the United States will stand for democracy, will stand for freedoms.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:54:10 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday said he is pausing 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

    "story": [
      "A former government official who says she was falsely accused of illegally sending funds to New York City to book luxury hotels for undocumented migrants \u2014 and then publicly ridiculed and fired \u2014 said Thursday that just days earlier she had been directed by a member of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to make the payments.",
      "Mary Comans, who was the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, sued the agency and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, on Tuesday.",
      "\"I was fired illegally by the Trump administration for doing my job, for doing exactly what I was directed to do by the Trump political appointees at the Department of Homeland Security and at the DOGE,\" she told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson did not respond for comment, nor did Brad Smith, the DOGE official Comans says she interacted with.",
      "The lawsuit argues she was \"unlawfully terminated\" from her position \"without cause or the due process required by law and the Constitution.\" As chief financial officer, Comans was a member of the \"senior executive service,\" the highest-level civil servant.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that DHS and FEMA publicly disclosed information about her",
      "termination that was protected under the Privacy Act and that she was defamed by the false portrayal about her conduct. At the time of her dismissal, Comans says the agency suggested falsely in a press release that she was a \"deep state activist.\"",
      "Comans joined DHS in 2004, inspired to serve in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. She called herself \"apolitical,\" noting that she served both Republican and Democratic administrations, often deploying to the scenes of natural disasters to help manage the federal government's response.",
      "\"My job is to serve the administration that was elected by the American people,\" she said.",
      "She had served as FEMA's chief financial officer since 2017 before she was abruptly fired on Feb. 11.",
      "During President Trump's first days back in office, Comans said the executive leadership team at FEMA was fielding executive orders as quickly as the president could sign them and \"were implementing them to the letter that he expected.\"",
      "One of the orders Comans carried out required DHS, and by extension FEMA, to freeze money going to nongovernmental organizations that provide services to undocumented immigrants. Payments that continued came from a $650 million Customs and Border Protection program created by Congress to reimburse cities for housing and sheltering migrants that had entered into the country illegally and were awaiting court proceedings. FEMA administered payments issued by the immigration program, but those funds were separate from the billions of dollars the agency spends on disaster relief.",
      "On Feb. 5, Comans says she and her team met with Smith, one of Elon Musk's top lieutenants, who was overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency's work at DHS. According to Comans, Smith instructed them to keep the funds from the CBP program flowing.",
      "Comans said it was \"very clear\" from the conversation with Smith \"that FEMA was doing the right thing in continuing\" the payments.",
      "\"We also received written guidance from the acting general counsel at FEMA that payments to state and locals needed to continue under the normal course of business,\" she said.",
      "Despite those assurances from Smith, on Feb. 10, Musk posted on X that DOGE \"just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President's executive order.\"",
      "Later that day, when she arrived at work, Comans says she met with her boss, acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton. She says Hamilton was also surprised by Musk's tweet and told her she had done nothing wrong. Comans then drafted a report, which CBS News reviewed, that documented her conversations with DOGE.",
      "\"I told him I was going to put together an after-action report detailing each of the conversations, the dates, the actions that FEMA took to show that we were operating within the guidelines provided to use by the Trump administration,\" Comans said. \"He thanked me, hugged me and again reassured me that nobody at FEMA would be fired for making these payments.\"",
      "Comans said she had another conversation with Hamilton that night to tell him that the funds had been recouped.",
      "\"I shared with him that I had successfully reversed the payment and the funds were being returned to Treasury as we speak,\" she said.",
      "The next morning, on Feb. 11, Comans says a colleague walked into Coman's office to tell her that she had been terminated effective immediately.",
      "\"Unfortunately, my colleague had no answers to provide me,\" Comans said.",
      "Her name went viral later that morning after conservative broadcaster Benny Johnson posted on X that Comans was \"fired for illegally funding migrant luxury hotels in NYC against the orders of President Trump.\" The post was spread by other rightwing accounts.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security sent out its press release about the firings shortly after that.",
      "\"Effective immediately, FEMA is terminating the employment of four individuals for circumventing leadership to unilaterally make egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants. Firings include FEMA's Chief Financial Officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist,\" the release said. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS will not sit idly and allow deep state activists to undermine the will and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Musk also shared a post about Comans, writing that her behavior was \"criminal.\"",

Sources said it was possible the signing would be moved to a later date.",
      "\"More Fake News! President Trump is NOT signing an Executive Order on the Department of Education today,\" Leavitt wrote.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump told reporters he's not having second thoughts about such an executive order.",
      "\"No, no, no, no,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I want to bring the schools, I want to bring the schools back to the states.\"",

      "\"Well, I want to just do it,\" the president said. \"I mean, we're starting the process. We're trying to get the schools back into the states. Let the states run the schools. And I'll tell you, you'll see something, it's gonna blow your mind, it'll be run so well.\"",
      "The president also said top administration officials discussed on Thursday which federal entity would be responsible for student loans, when a reporter asked what would happen to student loans if the Education Department is dissolved. He said student loans would be \"brought into either Treasury or Small Business Administration or Commerce.\"",
      "Completely eliminating the department would require congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "Senate Democrats held a news conference on Thursday about the planned executive order, with Majoirty Leader Chuck Schumer saying that \"it's no secret that they're aiming to abolish the Department of Education.\"",
      "Dismantling the Department of Education has long been a goal for Republicans, dating back to the Reagan administration.

    "summary": "President Trump removed Gwynne Wilcox from her position on the National Labor Relations Board soon after taking office.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington ruled Thursday that President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board was unlawful and said she must be allowed to continue in her role.",
      "In a 36-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, said that the Constitution and past decisions make clear that Congress can limit the president's removal power. She ruled that the president's firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB violated federal law that allows for a board member to be removed only for \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and declared her termination void.",
      "\"Under our constitutional system, such checks, by design, guard against executive overreach and the risk such overreach would pose of autocracy,\" Howell wrote in a 36-page decision. \"An American president is not a king \u2014 not even an 'elected' one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.\"",
      "Howell, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote that Mr. Trump \"seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme.\"",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "But soon after returning to a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump replaced Wilcox as chair and fired her from her position on the board in late January. While the National Labor Relations Act requires the president to remove a member \"upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" the email sent to Wilcox on behalf of the president stated that she and another board member have not \"been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of my administration.\"",
      "Wilcox told CBS News last month that she was \"stunned\" when she received a letter from the White House firing her.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, said. She swiftly challenged her firing in federal court.",
      "In her decision, the judge noted that in the 90 years since the NLRB was founded, the president has never removed a member of its board.",
      "\"His attempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal act are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice,\" she said.",
      "The court found that a Supreme Court decision from 1935 binds the outcome of Wilcox's case. That case carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "\"The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards or commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal protections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that \"nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has suggested the president's removal power is absolute.\"",
      "\"The president does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,\" the judge found.",
      "Howell criticized Mr. Trump for portraying himself as a king \u2014 pointing to a social media post from the White House last month that featured an illustration of the president wearing a crown, along with the headline \"long live the king\" \u2014 and said that he misunderstands the role of Article II of the Constitution, which lays out the scope of the president's powers.",
      "\"At issue in this case, is the president's insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive branch, overriding any congressionally mandated law in his way,\" she wrote. \"Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article II, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on presidential authority. The president's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power \u2014 or, more aptly, his aspiration \u2014 is flat wrong.\"",
      "The decision from Howell sets the case on a path to the Supreme Court and could lead it to overturn the 1935 decision in the case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Sarah Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Trump administration believes that certain for-cause removal restrictions for multi-member commissions are unconstitutional and would urge the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.",
      "The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years chipped away at that 90-year-old ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the\u00a0Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance was unconstitutional.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have already indicated that they believe the Supreme Court should reverse Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a\u00a0concurring opinion\u00a0to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warned vaccines could turn \"birds into mutant factories.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal health agencies oppose the use of bird flu vaccines in poultry right now, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, weighing in publicly on it for the first time in his new role. The Trump administration has been considering poultry vaccination as it seeks to combat the outbreak that is fueling a record surge in egg prices.",
      "U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said last month that they were ramping up planning on potentially deploying a vaccine for poultry, with the hopes of putting a draft of the plan before trading partners \"as quickly as possible,\" since it could affect billions of dollars in exports.",
      "\"There's no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity and all three of my health agencies, NIH, CDC, and FDA, the acting heads of those agencies have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News published this week.",
      "Sterilizing immunity means vaccine protection that completely stops infections and spread. Vaccines are rarely able to offer this kind of effectiveness, though the USDA said last month it would step up investments in \"potential new generation vaccines\" with better protection.",
      "Kennedy's remarks mark a sharp turn from the Biden administration, multiple former officials said.",
      "Biden officials from the health and agriculture departments had wrestled extensively with calls to roll out vaccines for animals as outbreaks mounted on farms nationwide. It was concerns from agriculture officials, not human health officials, that ultimately blocked plans to roll out vaccines.",
      "\"At no point did they express a concern or anything other than robust support for an animal vaccination program,\" one former USDA official said of the health agencies.",
      "At the time, Biden-era health officials viewed the ultimate decision as one outside of their expertise and better left to agriculture department experts, two people familiar with the planning said.",
      "Would vaccinating poultry turn birds into \"mutant factories\"?",
      "Kennedy said the new opposition from his health agencies was based on concerns that vaccinating poultry without being able to provide sterilizing immunity would amount to \"turning those birds into mutant factories,\" resulting in worrying genetic changes to the virus.",
      "\"That could actually accelerate the jump to human beings,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Experts say vaccination would need to be managed with strict biosecurity measures \u2014 extra precautions to prevent vaccinated birds from becoming infected \u2014 to reduce the risk of genetic changes in the virus.",
      "\"Creating conditions where the virus can freely mutate increases the likelihood of a strain emerging that can infect humans,\" said Daniel Perez, chair in poultry medicine at the University of Georgia, in an email.",
      "Perez said the risk is higher in large-scale poultry operations, where birds can have weaker immune systems.",
      "But he added that he sees vaccination as a strategic option to curb outbreaks for egg-laying chickens and backyard poultry, alongside other measures like intensive surveillance to detect outbreaks and continued culling of infected flocks of chickens raised for meat.",
      "\"Vaccination can be a useful tool when combined with strict biosecurity. If birds are kept from exposure to the virus, then vaccination can help to contain outbreaks,\" said Perez.",
      "Instead, Perez warned that another idea floated by Trump administration officials could pose a far greater risk: relying on immunity from poultry surviving bird flu infections.",
      "\"We've in fact said, at the USDA, that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,\" Kennedy had said.",
      "Perez said this approach would make surviving birds breeding grounds for worrying mutations.",
      "\"This implies a potentially dangerous misunderstanding of how avian influenza works. Allowing highly pathogenic avian influenza to spread through a poultry flock is extremely risky and counterproductive,\" he said.",
      "The Biden administration opted against vaccinating poultry for different reasons, former officials said.",
      "Agriculture officials had worried it could lead to missed spread of the virus through asymptomatic birds, trigger bans on imports of U.S. poultry products and be logistically challenging to thoroughly administer to massive commercial flocks.",
      "Kennedy's comments come days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released an updated assessment of the virus, finding that the risk remains \"low\" to the general population but higher for people like farm workers or veterinarians who might be exposed to infected animals or contaminated surfaces.",
      "Most confirmed bird flu cases in humans to date have been largely mild, except for a handful of hospitalizations and one death.",
      "The CDC stressed that its assessment of the risk, while low at this time, \"could change, as influenza A viruses can mutate quickly, and therefore have the potential to cause pandemics.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House voted Thursday morning to censure Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas for disrupting President Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "In a 224 to 198 vote, the House approved a censure resolution against Green, with 10 Democrats joining all Republicans in favor of the move. Two members, including Green, voted present.",
      "Green is the 28th lawmaker in U.S. history to be censured by the House. After the vote, he was ordered to stand in the well of the chamber while the resolution, which called his behavior \"a breach of proper conduct,\" was read aloud.",
      "Minutes into Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday, Green stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, warned Green to take his seat and \"maintain decorum,\" but Green refused. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "What does it mean to censure a congressman?",
      "Censure is essentially a formal rebuke by the House for some form of misconduct. The punishment usually requires the censured member to stand in front of the dais in the House chamber while the resolution is read by the presiding member \u2014 Johnson, in Green's case. It does not remove the member from office or impose any other penalties, beyond the reputational damage and historical notoriety that accompanies it.",
      "The practice was relatively rare throughout history, but it has become more frequent in recent years. Three other Democrats \u2014\u00a0Adam Schiff\u00a0of California,\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Jamaal Bowman\u00a0of New York \u2014 were censured in 2023. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar faced the punishment in 2021.",
      "It was most common during the Civil War and Reconstruction, when 13 members were censured for offenses ranging from assault in the Capitol to insulting another member.",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who introduced the resolution to censure Green, said the move was not personal and called it a \"difficult step.\"",
      "\"We cannot ignore the willful disruption intended to stop a proceeding,\" Newhouse, who is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the Capitol riot, said Wednesday. \"Without decorum, without respect, what do we got? What do we have, truly?\"",
      "Newhouse said Green's behavior reflects on all members of Congress and the moment serves as a reminder \"that we all need to raise our level of accountability.\"",
      "\"This is truly a wakeup call for this chamber,\" he said. \"The lack of decorum has reached a new low. When the president of the United States cannot even come into our chamber invited and complete his speech without the interaction that we saw last night, we have to take this action of censure.\"",
      "Before Green spoke during floor debate on the resolution Wednesday, he walked over to Newhouse and shook his hand. Green said he did not hold any ill will toward Johnson, the officers who escorted him out of the president's speech or those who supported his censure.",
      "\"The president indicated that he had a mandate. I said to the president, 'You do not have a mandate to cut Medicaid.' I have constituents who need Medicaid. They will suffer and some will die if they don't get Medicaid,\" Green said of why he heckled Mr. Trump. \"I would do it again.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said Republicans have shown \"selective outrage\" in their condemnation of certain behavior.",
      "\"I can't believe we're having this debate,\" McGovern said Wednesday.",
      "The conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, thought that the censure did not go far enough and is seeking to remove Green from his committee assignment. The group said it will introduce a resolution to strip him of his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, and expects Johnson to bring it up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People's business in lame attempts to derail President Trump's agenda,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the caucus.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",

      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island barred the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance, extending the block he put in place weeks ago in a case brought by a group of 23 states and the District of Columbia while the case moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a preliminary injunction Thursday that prohibits agencies from halting the flow of federal funds awarded to the states through grants, contracts or other financial assistance based on a memo from the Office of Management and Budget issued during President Trump's first days in office.",
      "\"The executive's categorical freeze of appropriated and obligated funds fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government,\" McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, wrote. \"The interaction of the three co-equal branches of government is an intricate, delicate, and sophisticated balance \u2014 but it is crucial to our form of constitutional governance. Here, the executive put itself above Congress.\"",
      "The judge said that the OMB order freezing federal funds across the government was \"without regard to Congress's authority to control spending,\" and found that the Trump administration failed to point to any statutory or constitutional authority to impose the government-wide pause.",
      "\"The court is not limiting the executive's discretion or micromanaging the administration of federal funds,\" McConnell wrote. \"Rather, consistent with the Constitution, statutes, and caselaw, the court is simply holding that the executive's discretion to impose its own policy preferences on appropriated funds can be exercised only if it is authorized by the congressionally approved appropriations statutes.\"",
      "He said that the freeze has impacted an array of programs, including Head Start and other childcare initiatives, as well as law enforcement and public safety agencies that rely on the federal dollars.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the coalition of states challenging the freeze, cheered the decision and reiterated that the power of the purse rests with Congress.",
      "\"The Trump administration's illegal funding freeze jeopardized law enforcement funding, essential health care and childcare services, and other critical programs that millions of Americans rely on,\" James said in a statement.",
      "McConnell had issued a temporary order at the end of January that ordered OMB to keep federal assistance flowing. His decision, as well as a February order finding that the Trump administration failed to comply with that directive, has made him a target of Mr. Trump's supporters. He is one of several federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration at the early stages of cases and faced threats of impeachment by congressional Republicans.",
      "The case before McConnell was brought by the group of states and the District of Columbia in response to the OMB memo issued in late January that called for federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans and other federal assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.",
      "The memo targeted roughly $3 trillion in federal assistance programs.",
      "Shortly after it was issued, OMB walked back the memo amid widespread chaos and confusion over what funds were at risk, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only the memo was rescinded, and the freeze itself would remain in force.",
      "The states brought their challenge to the OMB funding freeze in late January and argued that the directive violated federal law and the separation of powers.",
      "In his decision, McConnell called OMB's pause on federal assistance \"indiscriminate and unpredictable,\" and he said it is \"disingenuous\" to suggest that the challenged pauses stem from independent agency decisions, instead of the OMB directive.",
      "\"Overall, the OMB directive amounted to a command, not a suggestion, that agency defendants shall execute a categorical, indefinite funding freeze to align funding decisions with the president's priorities,\" the judge wrote.",
      "He also noted that there is no evidence Mr. Trump followed the federal law that lays out the procedures for withholding or cutting money appropriated by Congress, the Impoundment Control Act. The law requires the president to send a special message to Congress detailing the request to rescind or withhold funds, which McConnell said Mr. Trump did not do.",
      "McConnell wrote that the Trump administration \"abruptly froze\" billions of dollars in federal funding for an indefinite period of time.",
      "\"It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision \u2014 let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences \u2014 when these funding pauses endanger the states' ability to provide vital services, including but not limited to public safety, health care, education, childcare, and transportation infrastructure,\" he said.",
      "Similar challenges are underway in federal district courts across the East Coast. A judge in Washington, D.C., has also barred the Trump administration from pausing the federal aid.",
      "The OMB funding freeze is among an array of actions taken since Mr. Trump returned to office that is part of his plan to shrink the size of the federal government and spending. He created the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to spearhead the effort. Mr. Trump has said DOGE is led by Elon Musk, though the White House has claimed its acting administrator is Amy Gleason, who has worked for DOGE's precursor entity.",

      "Separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide sued to stop the cuts, saying they would cause \"irreparable harm.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Boston had temporarily blocked the cuts last month. Wednesday, she filed a preliminary injunction that puts the cuts on hold for longer while the suits proceed.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded about $35 billion in grants to research groups last year. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers' salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \"indirect\" costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \"overhead,\" but universities and hospitals argue they're far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Under prior policy, the government negotiated those rates with institutions. As an example, an institution with a 50% indirect cost rate would get another $50,000 to cover indirect expenses for a $100,000 project. The NIH's new policy would cap indirect costs at a flat rate of 15% instead, calculated to save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "Current and former\u00a0health\u00a0officials previously told CBS News they were shocked by the change, and stressed federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years, said last month.",
      "Negotiations over requests to cover those costs are often contentious and involve inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "Dr. David J. Skorton of the Association of American Medical Colleges, one of the plaintiffs, applauded the ruling. \"These unlawful cuts would slow medical progress and cost lives,\" he wrote in a statement, saying the NIH-funded research \"benefits every person and community in America.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/athena-moon-lander-tips-over-intuitive-machines-mission/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/butterfly-populations-declining-us-science-study/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",

      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",

      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",

    "story": [
      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",
      "\"Knowing where the air is really moving tells you a lot about what your vehicle is doing, how efficient it is, and how you can make it better,\" Ed Haering, principal investigator for the Schlieren photography, said in a 2023 NASA news release.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:12:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of following U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs, and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, key industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs go into effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could again delay the import duties. And even if the tariffs go back into effect in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston in a March 5 research note.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain models source a greater share of components from Canada and Mexico than others, manufacturers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer, we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means that even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the affect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When will price hikes take effect?",
      "The car buying process is often lengthy, requiring months of research before new buyers can drive their purchase off the lot.",
      "While prices won't skyrocket overnight if tariffs go into effect, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. Because of that, car buyers should start looking now, they added.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "He's not encouraging consumers to make impulse purchases, though.\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about the used car market?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market for better deals, which can in turn drive up used car prices.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law school told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food, you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now \u2014 you'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "In February, Border Patrol recorded roughly 8,500 apprehensions of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the lowest level in at least 25 years, according to government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "Asked if the dramatic change stems from new policies out of Washington, D.C., Herrera said, \"It has a lot to do with that.\"",
      "Citing muscular presidential powers, Mr. Trump has effectively shut down the American asylum system, allowing U.S. border agents to swiftly expel migrants under the legal premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\" He has also deployed thousands of additional troops to the U.S. southern border and tasked the military with carrying out deportations.",

      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",
      "Persistent inflation could deter the Fed from moving to nudge down interest rates and lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, experts note. About 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the central bak to cut rates at its next meeting on March 19.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that he is \"strongly considering\" imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it agrees to a ceasefire and peace deal that would halt Moscow's three-year war with Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on his social media platform, Truth Social, appears to be in response to drone and missile attacks launched on Ukrainian energy facilities Friday. The president said that because Russia is \"absolutely 'pounding'\" Ukraine, \"I am strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease fire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached.\"",
      "\"To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The president's threats of tariffs and sanctions are the first indication he is weighing adverse action against Russia since his tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House one week ago. But Mr. Trump told reporters\u00a0 in the Oval Office on Friday that he is \"finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don't have the cards.\"",
      "\"I find that in terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia \u2014 which is surprising \u2014 because they have all the cards,\" he said.",
      "The president acknowledged that Ukraine is taking \"tremendous punishment\" from Russia's air assaults but appeared to defend Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling reporters that he is \"doing what anybody else would do.\"",
      "\"I think he wants to get it stopped and settled and think he's hitting it harder than he's been hitting them,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin. \"I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now. He wants to get it ended, and I think Ukraine wants to get it ended.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy were on track last week to sign a key rare earth minerals agreement and hold a news conference at the White House, but the Ukrainian leader's visit ended abruptly after an Oval Office meeting between the two and top U.S. and Ukrainian officials became openly contentious.",
      "The president told Zelenskyy at the meeting that he should reach a ceasefire deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused Ukraine's leader of being \"disrespectful\" and not sufficiently grateful for U.S. support of its efforts to combat Russia's aggression.",
      "In the wake of the meeting, Mr. Trump paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing.",
      "But negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine appear to be resuming, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House national security adviser Michael Waltz set to head to Saudi Arabia next week for discussions with a Ukrainian delegation, Waltz said Friday.",
      "\"We had initial engagement with the Russians, the Ukrainians had a great opportunity to bind our economies together through that mineral deal,\" Waltz told reporters at the White House. \"Unfortunately that didn't go so well, but we think we're going to get things back on track.\" Mr. Trump also said NATO Secretary General Rutte would be coming for a visit next week.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters Wednesday that the goal is to \"get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire.\"",
      "Separately, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a speech Thursday that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place \"and will not hesitate to go 'all in,' should it provide leverage in peace negotiations,\" according to Reuters.",
      "Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said the first step toward achieving peace is for Russia to stop its attacks.",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to pursue the path to peace, and it is Ukraine that strives for peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,\" he wrote on social media Friday.",

The \"spunky and super fluffy 6-month-old\" has not yet been put front and center for visitors at the zoo, but he's already left a major impression on those who have been around him for for one very distinct reason.",

    "summary": "Brad Sigmon said he chose to die by bullets because he considered the other choices offered by the state to be worse.",
    "story": [
      "A South Carolina man is facing execution by firing squad\u00a0Friday \u2014 the first execution of its kind in the U.S. since 2010 and just the fourth firing squad execution since the death penalty resumed in the country 49 years ago.",
      "When the clock strikes 6 on Friday evening, 67-year-old Brad Sigmon is scheduled to walk into the death chamber, be strapped into a chair and have a target placed over his heart, unless the governor or the U.S. Supreme Court grants him a last-minute reprieve. He could say last words before a hood is placed over his head and three volunteers armed with rifles fire bullets designed to shatter on impact.",
      "Sigmon, who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat and kidnapped her after she refused to come back to him, said he chose to die by bullets because he considered the other choices offered by the state to be worse.",
      "His lawyers said he didn't want to pick the electric chair, which would \"cook him alive,\" or a lethal injection, whose details are kept secret in South Carolina. He also feared an injection of pentobarbital into his veins would send a rush of fluid into his lungs and drown him. On Thursday, Sigmon asked the U.S. Supreme Court to delay his execution because the state doesn't release enough information about the lethal injection drug.",
      "The death row inmate's only remaining choice was a firing squad, an execution method with a long and violent history in the U.S. and around the world. Death in a hail of bullets has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America's Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
      "The three previous firing squad executions in the U.S. took place in Utah.\u00a0Idaho,\u00a0Oklahoma and\u00a0Mississippi have also legalized firing squads, CBS News' Anna Schecter reports.",
      "\"He knows what the firing squad is going to do to his body \u2014 he knows it's going to break his bones, he knows it's gonna pulverize his organs,\" said Gerald \"Bo\" King, Sigmon's attorney. \"And it's a measure of how impossible the choice was here.\"",
      "In recent years, some death penalty proponents have started to see the firing squad as a more humane option: If the shooters' aim is true, death is nearly instant, whereas lethal injections require getting an IV into a vein. Electrocution appears to burn and disfigure. And inmates have been seen to writhe and struggle when the latest method, nitrogen gas, is used to suffocate them as it is pushed through a mask.",
      "Ronnie Gardner was the last prisoner to be executed by firing squad, in Utah in 2010. His brother doesn't agree the method is more humane.",
      "\"This will be gruesome and barbaric,\" Randy Gardner said. He said he didn't witness his brother's death but carries his autopsy photos in an envelope. He pulled several out to show an Associated Press reporter who will witness Friday's execution.",
      "The chamber inside which Sigmon will die is just a short walk from South Carolina's death row, where the prisoner has lived for the past 23 years.",
      "When the curtain opens Friday evening, Sigmon's lawyer, family members of the victims and three members of the news media will watch from behind glass recently upgraded to be bullet resistant.",
      "The shooters will be 15 feet away \u2014 the length from the backboard to the free-throw line on a basketball court.",
      "Moments after the hood is placed over Sigmon's head, three trained volunteers will shoot at the same time.",
      "Each will be armed with .308-caliber, Winchester 110-grain TAP Urban ammunition often used by police marksmen. The bullet is designed to shatter on impact with something hard, like an inmate's chest bones, sending fragments meant to destroy the heart and cause death almost immediately. Gardner said this ammunition will make Sigmon's execution \"so much worse\" than his brother's.",
      "A short time later, a doctor will confirm Sigmon is dead. At most, the process will take five minutes \u2014 a quarter of the time needed for a lethal injection.",
      "Why some states are turning to firing squad executions",
      "South Carolina turned to the firing squad as it struggled to find alternate methods to execute condemned inmates. By the beginning of this decade, the state's supply of lethal injection drugs was gone and no company would sell more except anonymously, which was not allowed at the time. Judges would not set execution dates if the electric chair was the only method. Thirteen years elapsed between executions, and cases of death row inmates started to pile up.",
      "A Democratic lawmaker in South Carolina suggested a firing squad if the state was going to keep capital punishment. Supporters cited U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote in a 2017 dissent that \"in addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.\"",
      "Sigmon has been close to death before. He had execution dates set three times, but each time it was when the state didn't have lethal injection drugs and judges halted his death warrant because he couldn't choose that method.",
      "If the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't intervene, Sigmon has one last chance at survival: His lawyers asked Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to commute his death sentence to life in prison. They said Sigmon is a model prisoner trusted by guards and works every day to atone for the killings he committed after succumbing to severe mental illness.",
      "Sigmon will share his final meal with some fellow prisoners on death row and plans to give away the money in his commissary accounts, his supporters said.",
      "The prison warden will be on a call with McMaster and the South Carolina Attorney General's Office just before the execution starts. If the lawyers report no outstanding appeals and the governor refuses clemency, Sigmon will be brought into the death chamber.",
      "According to the\u00a0Death Penalty Information Center, Sigmon is one of 32 inmates on death row in South Carolina. A total of 46 inmates have been executed in the state since 1976 and no clemencies have been granted, according to the center.",

Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",

      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",

      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Vice President Kamala Harris will decide whether she will run for governor of California in 2026 by the end of summer, a person familiar with her decision-making process said.",
      "Term limits prevent current California Gov. Gavin Newsom from running again, and the election to replace him will take place next year. Politico first reported the timing on Harris' self-imposed deadline to decide whether to run. Candidates have until early March 2026 to file paperwork ahead of the June 2, 2026, primary.",
      "Another source familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News that she is \"seriously considering\" a run for governor. A gubernatorial bid would likely mean she would not run for president in 2028, which she is also considering.",
      "The field to replace Newsom, who has been governor since 2019, is expected to be sizable, but Harris' entry into the race could dissuade other Democrats from launching bids of their own.",
      "A former Harris adviser said \"she'd be great,\" and has already proven she could lead at the national level and as California attorney general.",
      "\"On a national level, what Newsom has been able to do with that job, there is a lot of upside with what she can do as the governor of the fifth-largest economy with her name ID, when our party is looking for national leadership and California looking for good governance \u2014 especially at a time when California is going through a lot,\" the former adviser said.",
      "Harris, 60, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since her November loss to President Trump. Following the election, Harris and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff first headed back to California, while she took time to decide her next move. Her primary residence is in Los Angeles. As of January, multiple sources said she was expected to work on books about her time in politics and her interest in food and cooking. But discussions were already underway among her allies about a possible run for governor.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:13:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Among the CISA cuts were top recruits tasked with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic cyber attacks.",
    "story": [
      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort\u00a0to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",
      "To help assist fired employers at her former agency, Easterly has created a matching website to connect former CISA alumni and prospective employers.",
      "For his part, Thompson has started a hotline to encourage fired employees at the Department of Homeland Security and its components to share their stories.",
      "After the Trump administration tapped the Office of Personnel Management to fire federal employees en masse, a federal judge temporarily blocked it, citing OPM's lack of authority to fire employees at other agencies. This week, OPM updated its guidance to reflect that firing decisions are made by individual departments and agencies, spurring the rehiring or reinstatement of batches of fired workers in the weeks since. CISA has yet to follow suit.",
      "Asked if she'd return to the agency, Shaw paused. \"I would have to go back,\" she finally said, citing CISA's essential mission and a regular paycheck. \"I mean, they'd have to earn my trust back. But I don't know how you do that.\"",

      "The surviving roommates, who are identified in court documents as B.F. and D.M., exchanged text messages between 4:22 a.m. and 4:24 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 13, the new documents show. \u00a0According to the documents, D.M. placed unanswered phone calls to all four victims between 4:19 a.m. and 4:27 a.m.",
      "\"No one is answering,\" D.M. sent to B.F., according to the filing. \"I'm rlly confused rn.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Education could be headed for some major changes, with President Trump expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the agency.",
      "Although the timing of such a move is unclear, reports that is in the works are already raising questions for millions of parents, students and taxpayers about the future of the Education Department and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "In 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:",
      "Disbursing billions in student loans each yearOperating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which allows students to apply for loans, grants and other college aidProviding funding to help poor and disabled students enrolled in K-12 schoolsEnsuring equal access to education through its Office of Civil RightsOperating the Pell grant program, which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7,400 per year to attend collegeFunding public charter schoolsOverseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agenciesCollecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",

      "Operating the Pell grant program, which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7,400 per year to attend college",
      "Funding public charter schools",
      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA has relied on food companies for decades to determine whether their ingredients are safe.",
    "story": [
      "Joseph Shea, who sells athletic wear in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, wonders and worries about the food he eats.",
      "The chemical ingredients with mystifying names. The references on product labels to unspecified natural or artificial flavors. The junk food that fits his budget but feels addictive and makes him feel unwell.",
      "Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.",
      "In many cases, it is not.",
      "The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end \"the mass poisoning of American children.\" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Martin Makary, President Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods \"with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.\"",
      "\"These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,\" he said.",
      "But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.",
      "To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.",
      "Though pharmaceutical companies are required to share research on humans with the FDA, the agency is largely blind to what food-makers know about their products.",
      "\"The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,\" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.",
      "As a result: The FDA's oversight of food additives is much weaker than its oversight of prescription drugs.",
      "\"There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food,\" Califf testified.",
      "Food is a big business. American consumers spend almost $1.7 trillion annually on food and beverages, according to Circana, a research and advisory firm.",
      "Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.",
      "KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers \u2014 The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondel\u0113z International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and Unilever \u2014 for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.",
      "None provided answers to those questions.",
      "\"We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,\" Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.",
      "Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.",
      "Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.",
      "Potentially harmful ingredients \"are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,\" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.",
      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

      "Two vessels capsized off Yemen late Thursday, said Tamim Eleian, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, or IOM. Two crewmembers were rescued, but 181 migrants and five Yemeni crewmembers remain missing, he told The Associated Press. At least 124 men and 57 women were on board, the news statement said.",

      "\"These latest shipwrecks are a sobering reminder of the grave dangers migrants endure in search of a better future,\" said Abdusattor Esoev, IOM's Chief of Mission in Yemen. \"Smugglers continue to gamble with human lives, pushing people onto dangerous journeys despite clear weather warnings.

      "The State Department's\u00a0travel advisory for Turks and Caicos Islands is a Level 2, advising Americans to exercise increased caution if they visit.",
      "The primary reason for the Level 2 advisory is crime, the State Department says. The warning says most crime happens in Providenciales, the most populated island in the British territory.",
      "\"Police may have limited investigatory resources,\" the advisory says.",

      "Level 3: Reconsider travel",

      "Level 1 is the lowest advisory and indicates there is some risk in any international travel. Level 2 means there are \"heightened risks to safety and security,\" which could apply to specific areas of the country.",
      "Level 3 advises Americans to reconsider traveling to the nation because of \"serious risks to safety and security.\" Level 4 is the highest advisory level indicating there is a \"greater likelihood of life-threatening risks.\" The department advises Americans to write a will and leave DNA samples if they decide to travel to a Level 4 nation in preparation for possible worst-case scenarios.",
      "Some nations could have multiple levels, with parts of the country more of a concern. For example, the advisory for Mexico, as of March 7, has specific levels for each state within the country, ranging from Level 1 to Level 4.",
      "In each advisory, the State Department explains the factors contributing to the level designation, identifies possible areas of more risk and gives advice on what to do if you decide to travel to that country.",
      "Examples of countries with each travel advisory level",
      "Here are examples of countries in each advisory level, as of March 7:",
      "Level 1: Canada, Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Argentina and multiple Caribbean islands, including Aruba and St. Lucia, are among the Level 1 countries.",
      "Level 2: Popular European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany, have Level 2 advisories. Other examples are mainland China, South Africa, Morocco, Peru and The Bahamas.",
      "Level 3: Countries with Level 3 advisories include Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala and Jamaica. Most of the Level 3 nations include specific higher risk areas that the State Department says to avoid.",
      "Level 4: The State Department has designated more than a dozen nations as Level 4, advising Americans not to travel to them. They include Russia and Ukraine due to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Others at Level 4 include Syria, Iraq, Sudan and South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "How often does the State Department review travel advisories?",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that he is \"strongly considering\" imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it agrees to a ceasefire and peace deal that would halt Moscow's three-year war with Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on his social media platform, Truth Social, appears to be in response to drone and missile attacks launched on Ukrainian energy facilities Friday. The president said that because Russia is \"absolutely 'pounding'\" Ukraine, \"I am strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease fire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached.\"",
      "\"To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The president's threats of tariffs and sanctions are the first indication he is weighing adverse action against Russia since his tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House one week ago. But Mr. Trump told reporters\u00a0 in the Oval Office on Friday that he is \"finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don't have the cards.\"",
      "\"I find that in terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia \u2014 which is surprising \u2014 because they have all the cards,\" he said.",
      "The president acknowledged that Ukraine is taking \"tremendous punishment\" from Russia's air assaults but appeared to defend Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling reporters that he is \"doing what anybody else would do.\"",
      "\"I think he wants to get it stopped and settled and think he's hitting it harder than he's been hitting them,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin. \"I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now. He wants to get it ended, and I think Ukraine wants to get it ended.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy were on track last week to sign a key rare earth minerals agreement and hold a news conference at the White House, but the Ukrainian leader's visit ended abruptly after an Oval Office meeting between the two and top U.S. and Ukrainian officials became openly contentious.",
      "The president told Zelenskyy at the meeting that he should reach a ceasefire deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused Ukraine's leader of being \"disrespectful\" and not sufficiently grateful for U.S. support of its efforts to combat Russia's aggression.",
      "In the wake of the meeting, Mr. Trump paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing.",
      "But negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine appear to be resuming, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House national security adviser Michael Waltz set to head to Saudi Arabia next week for discussions with a Ukrainian delegation, Waltz said Friday.",
      "\"We had initial engagement with the Russians, the Ukrainians had a great opportunity to bind our economies together through that mineral deal,\" Waltz told reporters at the White House. \"Unfortunately that didn't go so well, but we think we're going to get things back on track.\" Mr. Trump also said NATO Secretary General Rutte would be coming for a visit next week.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters Wednesday that the goal is to \"get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire.\"",
      "Separately, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a speech Thursday that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place \"and will not hesitate to go 'all in,' should it provide leverage in peace negotiations,\" according to Reuters.",
      "Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said the first step toward achieving peace is for Russia to stop its attacks.",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to pursue the path to peace, and it is Ukraine that strives for peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,\" he wrote on social media Friday.",

In the interview, Mr. Trump said he sent the letter \"yesterday,\" but the exact timing remained unclear.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said in a clip from the interview, which was shared by the network ahead of its full airing this weekend, Fox said.",
      "\"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted \"to get that letter,\" adding that \"the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Iran's state-run media said Friday that no letter had been received from Mr. Trump, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French news agency AFP on Friday that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while heavy U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium,\" marking a progression in the country's nuclear program since Mr. Trump was reelected.",
      "In 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from a negotiated deal with Iran and other world powers that was aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program. Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for entirely peaceful purposes, as tension has continued to rise with the U.S. over its sanctions, and with Israel over its war against the Iranian-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.",
      "Last August, Khamenei said there was \"no harm\" in engagement with the U.S., but more recently he said negotiations would not be \"intelligent, wise or honorable.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",
      "\"Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,\" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.",
      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",
      "More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.",
      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.",

      "Those comments sparked outrage from politicians in France and the U.K. \u2014 the only two countries that have thus far said they might send troops to help maintain peace under a ceasefire in Ukraine.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis, 88, has been in a Rome hospital for 3 weeks, but he was well enough as he recovers from pneumonia to record a first message for his supporters.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 The voice of Pope Francis was heard by the public on Thursday night for the first time since he was admitted to a hospital three weeks earlier. The message was recorded from the 88-year-old pope's room at the Gemelli Polyclinic hospital in Rome, according to the Vatican.",
      "\"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square,\" Francis said in the message played out to those who have been praying for him in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "That Francis was able to speak to record the message was an encouraging sign, but his frailty could be heard in the recording. Francis' voice sounded weak and breathless.",
      "The pope was admitted on February 14 with a bad case of bronchitis that devolved into bilateral pneumonia, or pneumonia in both lungs. It would be a serious prognosis for anyone, but especially for someone of the pope's age \u2014 and even more so for a man who had part of one lung removed due to a respiratory infection as a young man in his home country of Argentina.",
      "In a clear setback, the Vatican said Francis suffered two episodes of acute respiratory failure on Monday. At one point, doctors had to intervene by aspirating mucus from his airways. He's been alternating between high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation since then and, according to the Vatican's twice-daily updates, resting well.",
      "Francis has been adamant about sharing an unprecedented level of detail when it comes to his health, going against centuries of secrecy surrounding pontiffs as they near the end of their lives \u2014 as well as the old Italian adage that \"a pope is always well until he dies.\"",
      "The Vatican said again Friday morning that Francis' condition was stable, but that his prognosis remained \"guarded,\" meaning he's still deemed to be in danger.",
      "The pope has been able to undergo physical therapy, both in the form of breathing exercises and for his mobility. The Vatican has consistently reported on his ability to get out of bed, sit in a chair, read daily newspapers and carry out many of his official duties from his hospital room.",
      "Several times during this hospitalization \u2014 which has been the longest of the four during his papacy \u2014 the Vatican has commented on the pope making phone calls to the Catholic community in the war-torn Gaza Strip. He has spoken regularly with the parish there since the war was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "For three Sundays in a row, the pontiff has been absent from his Angelus appearances in St. Peter's Square. His audio message came a day after Ash Wednesday, marking the start of the Lenten season leading up to Easter.",
      "For two weeks, Cardinals have been leading nightly recitations of the Rosary to pray for the ailing pontiff. Vatican sources tell CBS News that it is premature to say when Francis might be discharged from the hospital.",
      "The Vatican announced weeks ago that Francis would not be celebrating this year's Easter Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica this year, due to his ongoing recovery.",

The call from Zelenskyy to halt aerial bombardments on energy facilities builds on growing rhetoric from Kyiv, Washington and Moscow on halting the war just over three years after it was sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said the first steps to establishing real peace should be stopping both Russian and Ukrainian aerial and naval attacks. It may have become harder for Ukraine to anticipate and thwart those attacks this week in the wake of President Trump's decision to pause both intelligence sharing and the provision of military support after a contentious meeting with Zelenskyy a week ago.",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to go the way of peace, and it is Ukraine that wants peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,\" he wrote in a post on social media.",
      "The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched at least 58 missiles and nearly 200 drones, damaging energy facilities across the country from Kharkiv in the east to Ternopil in the west.

      "The Kremlin responded to earlier calls by Zelenskyy for a halt to aerial attacks by ruling out any temporary ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy's allies abroad have voiced support for his truce proposal, which includes elements similar to a vague proposal put forth by France days ago. On Friday, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who recently hosted the Ukrainian leader, also gave the idea his backing.",

      "Russia is \"targeting facilities linked to Ukraine's military-industrial complex,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "The Ukrainian air force said it had deployed French-mad Mirage fighter jets \u2014 delivered to Ukraine just last month \u2014 for the first time to repel the aerial onslaught. The jets, along with air defense units, shot down 34 of the missiles and 100 drones, the air force said.",
      "DTEK, the largest private energy supplier in Ukraine, said its facilities in the Black Sea region of Odesa were targeted for a fourth night in a row. It said gas facilities in the central Poltava region had \"ceased operations\" after being struck in the overnight attack.",

Senator Natasha Akpoti Uduaghan accused the legislative body's president, Godswill Akpabio, of making unwanted advances toward her in an interview with Nigerian media last week and filed a petition against him.",

      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korea suspended the training flights of air force aircraft and all live-fire drills following its fighter jets' accidental bombing of a civilian area, officials said Friday, posing a potential setback to its upcoming annual military training with the United States.",
      "On Thursday, two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly released four MK-82 bombs each on a civilian area in Pocheon, a city near the tense border with North Korea. The bombing, which injured nearly 30 people, two of them seriously, occurred when South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill in connection with their broader Freedom Shield command post exercise set to begin Monday.",
      "This year's Freedom Shield exercise is the allies' first major joint training since President Trump returned to office in January and comes amid concerns about North Korea's booming military cooperation with Russia.",
      "South Korea and the U.S. announced details of the exercises on Thursday, but that was overshadowed by the news of bombing, which drew intense public criticism in South Korea.",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries halted all live-fire exercises across South Korea. Military officials said South Korea's air force also stopped the flights of all its aircraft except surveillance planes and others needed for emergency situations.",

      "But if they fail to resume the paused training by Monday, when they kick off the Freedom Shield exercise with the U.S. military, that would hurt the workings of the early parts of the exercise, observers say.",
      "Possible issues with U.S.-South Korean joint exercises",
      "Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said the suspension of flight training would particularly cause \"really a big problem in examining the two countries' operational plans.\" He said flying warplanes would be essential to determining their actual capabilities, discussing the size of reinforcements of U.S. aircraft from abroad and modifying the allies' operational plans.",
      "Initial investigations found the pilot of one of the KF-16s entered wrong coordinates for a bombing site. Officials said the pilots of the two jets had more than 200-400 hours of flying time. But Lee said they likely piloted KF-16s only two to three years.",
      "The South Korean and U.S. militaries have already begun field exercises in connection with the Freedom Shield, and Thursday's live-fire drill was one of them. Col. Ryan Donald, spokesperson for the U.S. military in South Korea, confirmed that American servicemembers were participating in Thursday's live-fire training but said no U.S. air force aircraft were still involved.",
      "\"We take this incident very seriously. We are coordinating closely with the ROK Ministry of Defense and are committed to a thorough and transparent investigation,\" Donald said in a statement, using the acronym of South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "The incident happened as North Korea was ramping up its fiery rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea, as it views their joint drills as invasion rehearsals. North Korea's state news agency warned Friday that the U.S. and South Korea \"will have to pay dearly for their stupid and reckless war drills.\"",

      "The decision by the Seoul Central District Court would allow Yoon to stand trial while not being physically detained. The hearings in his separate impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court concluded in late February and the court is expected to rule soon on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said it accepted Yoon's request to be released from jail because the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted in late January. The court said the investigative agency that detained Yoon before his formal arrest didn't have legal rights to investigate the criminal rebellion charges.",
      "Yoon's defense team welcomed the court's decision and urged prosecutors to release him immediately. The presidential office also welcomed the court's decision, saying it hopes Yoon will swiftly return to work.",
      "However, South Korea law allows prosecutors to hold a suspect temporarily while they pursue an appeal.",
      "Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, told Agence France-Presse Yoon \"will be released only if the prosecutor waives the right to appeal or does not file an appeal within the prescribed period.\"",
      "Prosecutors didn't immediately respond when AFP requested a comment.",
      "Investigators have alleged that the martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon's martial law decree, which involved the dispatch of troops and police forces to the National Assembly, evoked traumatic memories of past military rules among many South Koreans. The decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to get into an assembly hall to allow a vote and then voted unanimously to overturn it.",
      "Yoon later argued his decree was only meant to inform the people of the danger of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which undermined his agenda and impeached top officials, and said he dispatched troops to the assembly only in order to maintain order. But some top military and police officers sent to the assembly have told Constitutional Court hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to obstruct a vote on his decree or detain politicians.",
      "If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon's impeachment, he would be officially thrown out of office and a national election would be held to choose his successor within two months.",
      "Massive rallies by opponents and supporters of Yoon have filled the streets of Seoul and other major South Korean cities. Whatever the Constitutional Court decides, experts say it will likely further polarize the country and intensify its conservative-liberal divide.",
      "Yoon is the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office. South Korean law gives a president immunity from most criminal prosecution, but not for grave charges like rebellion or treason.",
      "By law, a president in South Korea has the power to put the country under martial law in wartime and similar emergency situations, but many experts say South Korea wasn't in such conditions when Yoon declared martial law.",

      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",
      "\"The best way I can describe it is like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across their noses \u2014 we got their attention,\" he said. \"But it's a pause, it's not an end. It's then up to them.\"",
      "Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming. I told them.\"",
      "\"If you take away support like that, of course it's important,\" said Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that's why it was done.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said Vladimir Putin will also have to make concessions to bring about a ceasefire, but those have not been outlined by the White House to date. To even engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S. access to a major share of Ukraine's mineral resources.",
      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Zelenskyy's dressing-down at the White House, Ukrainian officials \u2014 including Zelenskyy himself \u2014 made it clear they were\u00a0still willing to sign an economic agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called Macron's remarks \"a threat to Russia,\" while dismissing European suggestions that it is in fact Russia which poses a threat to security on the continent, calling that \"stupid\" and \"delirious nonsense.\"",
      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",
      "As Europe grapples over how to ensure its own defense from future Russian or other threats, Ukrainians will be hoping the continent's leaders move quickly to boost their own defenses against Russia's current, ongoing assault.",
      "France was quick to confirm it would continue sharing its intelligence with Ukraine after the U.S. cutoff, with Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu saying: \"Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that all the great... warm political will of the European nations will also, as urgently as possible, will translate in upscaling their defense engagement with Ukraine,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News. \"They've given a lot. They have much more limited capacities than the United States, but we hope that they will be able to invest in Ukrainian defense capacities, that they will be able to upscale their defense production, that they will help us also to procure weaponry in order for us to stay strong while Russia has not given up on their plans to just destroy us.\"",
      "She made it clear that Ukraine would also continue working toward an agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are to try to get the message across to the American public. I think that this is also very important, and I'm sure that President Trump really cares about the support that he enjoys back in the United States, and I hope that he hears also his citizens [saying] why this is important, and why it is expected that the United States will stand for democracy, will stand for freedoms.\"",

High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Phil Goff questioned whether the U.S. president \"really understands history\" during a panel discussion about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The comments were \"deeply disappointing\", said a spokesman for New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, adding: \"They do not represent the views of the NZ government and make his position as High Commissioner to London untenable.\"",
      "Peters later said he would have fired Goff if he made the same remarks about any other world leader.",
      "\"It's seriously regrettable,\" Peters told reporters.",
      "Goff, a former foreign minister, compared recent Ukraine peace efforts with the 1938 Munich Agreement \u2014 a pact between European powers that allowed Nazi Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia.

      "Authorities in northern Mexico on Wednesday found about 70 pounds of fentanyl hidden inside boxes of sliced cactus, a quintessential Mexican food staple known as nopales.",
      "Mexican law enforcement said they seized some 275,000 pills of the lethal drug in the border state of Sonora, on its way to Arizona, and that they arrested a 29-year-old man. The drugs were valued at about $6.5 million. Authorities found both pills and the drug in powder form.",
      "The seizure took place at a military checkpoint on the Mexican highway connecting the northern states of Sinaloa and Sonora, where officers searched a trailer carrying packets of nopales.",
      "It's just the latest in a cat-and-mouse game between drug smugglers and authorities around the world, as traffickers find increasingly outlandish ways to sneak drugs into other countries. Packets of cocaine and fentanyl have been found tucked away in hair extensions, stowed inside car mufflers, baked into bread, and hidden inside avocados and bananas. Some organizations have used submarines to transport illicit drugs across international borders.",
      "The seizure also comes during a tense moment between Mexico and the United States, as Mexico scrambles to satisfy President Donald Trump's demands to stop the flow of fentanyl and migrants north, which he has used to justify the 25% tariffs he put in place on Tuesday, though migration north and fentanyl overdoses had already sharply dipped before Trump took office. President Trump has made similar demands of Canada, but officials say very little fentanyl flows over that border.",

The journalist described the room as decorated with Victorian furnishings, oil paintings of herself and Dean as children and \"butterflies everywhere\" \u2014 many of which she noted were mementos from fans.",
      "Dolly Parton poses for a portrait session in 1978 in Los Angeles, California (Harry Langdon/Getty Images)",

After playing the first side of the record, Parton asked if Nash wanted to hear the second side. After Nash agreed, Parton told her, \"Well, before that,\" she said, \"Carl is here \u2014 he\u2019s working outside \u2014 and I want him to come in and fix the fire.

      "Nash recalled that Dean was initially reluctant to join the two, writing that she overheard him tell Parton \"I don\u2019t want to do no interviews.\" After being reassured by Parton, Dean entered the living room and Nash caught her first glimpse of the singer's elusive spouse. Nash described him as appearing \"shy and uncomfortable in the presence of a stranger.\"",
      "\"He loves me good and all, but I\u2019m really not his favorite singer.\"",
      "However, she noted that Dean was \"friendly and polite\" when he was introduced to her. As Dean tended to the fire, Nash observed that he was \"ruggedly handsome\" and \"looked at his wife as if she were the only woman in the world.\"",
      "Dean died Monday in Nashville at the age of 82. (Dolly Parton Instagram)",
      "As their interview continued, Parton invited Nash to stay for dinner and try some of her \"world-famous spaghetti,\" saying she would tell Dean that Nash was a \"friend.\" \u00a0Nash noted that the invite was a rarity since the couple \"rarely socialized and never entertained.\"",
      "In Nash's essay, she recalled that Dean excused himself from joining them for dinner since he had a cold. However, he continued to return to the living room from time to time to fix the fire as Parton and Nash talked late into the evening.",

      "She continued, \"With each successive visit, he was more at ease, more likable and charming. At one point, he asked me if I\u2019d gone to school for journalism. I told him I had, in New York City. He then, in an offhand way, began asking me about New York politicians.

      "Over the years, Parton provided glimpses into their lives during interviews and has occasionally shared throwback photos of herself with Dean on social media. In 2021, she shared a throwback snap of the two, writing, \"Find you a partner who will support you like my Carl Dean does!\"",
      "On Valentine's Day in 2022, the 10-time Grammy Award winner marked the occasion by posting an image of herself with her longtime love.

      "While the pop star has \"publicly distanced\" herself from the legal back-and-forth, she could be called to testify after being dragged into the situation by Baldoni's lawsuit.

      "\"Yes, she just wrapped the first-ever billion-dollar tour and is arguably at the pinnacle of her popularity; however, last year, she isolated a lot of fans with her political affiliation (pro-Harris, anti-Trump) and there's a certain market value she has to keep in mind: vanilla wins,\" Eldridge noted.",

So, too, is the case with Swift and Lively. If your best friend is 12 months away from trial but is losing another round of PR points every 12 minutes, it might be best to be more local than vocal.

The jury may be starstruck at first to see Taylor Swift testify, but that will quickly evaporate once she starts testifying and her credibility and veracity are on display,\" Lovell noted. \"Remember, she\u2019s not a party but a witness, so her celebrity factor will be limited to her witness testimony and whether or not she\u2019s telling the truth or otherwise being accurate.

Depositions are commonplace in civil litigation with the parties seeking them only having to establish that the deponent may have relevant information about the case. If Ms. Swift moves to quash the deposition subpoena, Mr. Baldoni will have to demonstrate that she possesses relevant information to the claims or defenses in the case.\"",

      "Why should you store your driver's license in Apple Wallet?",
      "Storing your Apple ID in your Apple Wallet may be more secure than carrying a physical card that can be lost easily. Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name. To display things such as your address, date of birth and so on, you must sign in with Face ID or Touch ID.",
      "Information is only ever transferred from your Apple Wallet via NFC, which uses an encrypted Bluetooth data connection. This means nothing can be easily or quickly copied. Whenever you have to hand your phone over to a police officer or TSA agent, they won't see your personal information without authentication from you.",

You hold the device near the reader, and a screen will appear telling you exactly which information you will share.

For example, a security guard who needs to check your ID at a venue entrance would have a reader that shows your ID photo and confirms if you're over 21. They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",
      "At the time of publishing, police agencies do not accept digital IDs as driver's licenses, so you'll need to have your physical ID when driving. However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs.

Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tony's story is a chilling reminder that even the most diligent savers can fall victim to sophisticated scams. These vishing schemes, carefully orchestrated like a theatrical play, exploit our trust and leverage real security alerts to gain access to our accounts. Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities. By understanding their methods and taking preventative steps, we can make it harder for them to succeed.",

      "Companies that handle massive amounts of user data are often the least careful with it. Last year, the National Public Data breach\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. The company\u2019s entire business model was built around collecting data from public sources to create detailed user profiles for people in the U.S. and beyond. Now, another breach has surfaced, this time affecting DISA Global Solutions, an employee screening provider.",

      "DISA Global Solutions, a company specializing in employee screening services, recently\u00a0disclosed a major data breach affecting over 3.3 million individuals. The Texas-based firm serves more than 55,000 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, offering background checks, drug and alcohol testing and compliance solutions.",
      "The breach began on Feb. 9, 2024, when an unauthorized party gained access to part of DISA\u2019s network. Shockingly, the intrusion went undetected for more than two months until the company discovered the \"cyber incident\" on April 22, 2024. Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems. Adding to the concern, nearly a year passed before the public was notified, which raises serious questions about DISA\u2019s cybersecurity measures and response time.",

According to filings with the attorneys general of Maine and\u00a0Massachusetts, the compromised information included Social Security numbers, financial account details (such as credit card numbers), driver\u2019s licenses and other government-issued identification documents.",
      "Given DISA\u2019s role in employee screening, the breach likely exposed data collected from background checks and drug tests, potentially including employment histories, criminal records and even health-related information. The notification to affected individuals \u2013 more than 360,000 were Massachusetts residents and 15,198 from Maine \u2013 underscored the breadth of the incident, affecting a staggering 3,332,750 people nationwide.",

      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "A groundbreaking development has come from researchers at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University in Japan. They've created a biohybrid hand, a fusion of lab-grown muscle tissue and mechanical engineering, capable of gripping and making gestures. This innovation paves the way for a new generation of robotics with diverse applications.",

      "While soft robots and advanced prosthetics are becoming increasingly common, the combination of living tissue and machines is still relatively rare. The field of biohybrid science is in its infancy, with only a few examples, such as artificial fish powered by human heart cells or robots using locust ears for hearing. This new biohybrid hand represents a significant step forward in the practical application of this technology.",

      "So, how did they do it? The team started by growing muscle fibers in the lab. Recognizing that these delicate tissues wouldn't be strong enough on their own, they bundled them into what they call \"multiple tissue actuators,\" or MuMuTAs. \"Our key achievement was developing the MuMuTAs,\" said Shoji Takeuchi from the University of Tokyo.",
      "Takeuchi is the co-author of a study describing the creation that was published in the journal\u00a0Science Robotics. Shoji explained that creating MuMuTAs was their key achievement.

      "Challenges and future directions",
      "Takeuchi and his team acknowledge that their creation is currently a proof of concept. During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

      "The Zacks Investment breach first came to light in late January 2025 when a hacker known as \"Jurak\" claimed on BreachForums that they had gained access to Zacks' systems as early as June 2024.",
      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make.

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

      "Jeff and Rachel Lobman did not expect to receive backlash when they put up a sign reading \"Jewish students deserve to be safe on campus\" in the yard of their home in a suburb of Philadelphia. When their son was home from college for winter break, the Lobmans posted the sign to symbolize their solidarity with Jewish college students who experienced antisemitism in the wake of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "The sign held a double meaning for the family. In addition to its message against antisemitism, the color pink resonated with the Lobmans, as they are passionate advocates for breast cancer research.",
      "Lower Merion School District (LMSD) Board member Anna Shurak, who happens to be the Lobmans\u2019 next-door neighbor, took issue with the sign. According to the Lobmans, before Shurak reached out asking them to remove the sign, she blocked it with a wheelbarrow and dirt. In response, the Lobmans elevated the sign, but Shurak then used a Philadelphia Eagles flag to block it a second time.",

      "South Carolina keeping information secret about how it conducts lethal injections led him to decide on the firing squad, which he acknowledges will be a violent death, his lawyer said. On Thursday, Sigmon\u2019s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to delay his execution because the state doesn't release enough information about the lethal injection drug.",
      "Sigmon said he carried out the brutal slayings because he was angry that victims Gladys and David Larke had been evicted from a trailer they owned. They were in separate rooms of their Greenville County home and Sigmon went back and forth attacking them until they were dead, investigators said.",

      "\"Bryan C. Kohberger, by and through his attorneys of record\u2026 hereby moves this Court to strike the death penalty as a sentencing option in his case because Mr. Kohberger\u2019s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reduces his culpability, negates the retributive and deterrent purposes of capital punishment, and exposes him to the unacceptable risk that he will be wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death,\" Anne Taylor wrote in a newly unsealed, 28-page court filing.",
      "She argued that repetitive behaviors such as rocking in place or Kohberger's failure to make eye contact would be perceived by jurors as \"strange, out-of-control, and even disrespectful of such a solemn proceeding\" or interpreted as guilt or shame.

The decree lasted only six hours, as enough lawmakers managed to get into an assembly hall and voted to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon later argued his decree was only meant to inform the people of the danger of the opposition Democratic Party, which undermined his agenda and impeached top officials, and said he dispatched troops to the assembly only in order to maintain order. But some top military and police officers sent to the assembly have told Constitutional Court hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to obstruct a vote on his decree or detain politicians.",
      "If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon\u2019s impeachment, he will be officially thrown out of office and a national election will be held to choose his successor within two months.

      "The memo was sent to heads of various departments and offices with the subject line \"Managing the 2025 regular budget liquidity crisis.\" According to the memo, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued a directive to manage cashflow \"conservatively\" and to suspend hiring. It also contained a warning to the department heads, telling them to prepare to work with 80% of their allocated budgets.",

Insiders were allegedly surprised by the personnel freeze, though they doubt there will be any concrete pause to hiring.",
      "In addition to the memo, Secretary-General Guterres sent an invitation to all secretariat personnel to participate in a virtual town hall later this month. The invitation did not state an official topic for the town hall, but Dujarric confirmed to Fox News Digital that \"the secretary-general will address the financial situation of the U.N.\"",

      "While the U.N. has been able to get by on its assumption that it could find ways to bail itself out, it may have exhausted those methods, according to Dugan. Additionally, Dugan said the U.N.\u2019s assumption that it can use its power on the world stage as leverage in negotiations with the U.S. has proven to be \"preposterous\" in recent years.",
      "The U.N. may very well have a reason to worry after President Donald Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress in which he listed numerous examples of \"appalling waste\" identified by DOGE. However, the possibility of other countries that provide major funding to the international body reassessing their spending as well could be causing further concern.",
      "However, Dujarric denied the memo was a \"direct result of the political situation in the U.S.\" and that the U.N. has \"faced a liquidity crisis\" for decades, as \"not all member states pay in full\" or \"on time.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration announced it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to Columbia due to \"inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday announced that it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University \"due to the school\u2019s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"",
      "The move comes just days after the administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified Columbia that it was going to conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the university's federal grants and contracts.",
      "The task force includes staffers from the Justice Department, Health and Human Services Department, Education Department and the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "In a statement explaining the cancellation of certain federal grants Friday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon implied that Columbia had not complied with federal antidiscrimination laws.",
      "\u201cSince October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses \u2014 only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,\u201d she said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cUniversities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the announcement, Columbia committed to engaging with the Trump administration on the issue in the hopes of restoring the lost federal funds.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing the announcement from the federal agencies and pledge to work with the federal government to restore Columbia\u2019s federal funding. We take Columbia\u2019s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to\u00a0combatting antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff,\" a spokesperson for the university told NBC News.",
      "In a post on X later Friday, McMahon said that she had a \"productive meeting\" with the university's interim president Katrina Armstrong.",
      "\"Had a productive meeting with Columbia\u2019s interim president Katrina Armstrong today. Look forward to working together to protect all students on their campus. The Trump Administration will not allow the continued harassment and threats of violence against students,\" the education secretary wrote.",
      "This comes after Columbia and other universities became the site of large pro-Palestinian protests following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The Biden administration investigated Columbia and other universities multiple times for alleged violations of antidiscrimination laws.",
      "First, in 2023, the Department of Education opened investigations into Columbia and six other colleges and universities for potential violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",
      "Last May, the Education Department again launched an investigation into Columbia, that time looking into anti-Palestinian discrimination.",
      "On Friday, Leo Terrell, senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights and the head of the Justice Department Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, said in a statement that canceling these federal funds \"is one of the tools we are using to respond to this spike in anti-Semitism.\"",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" he added.",
      "After the Trump administration's announcement, Brian Cohen, the executive director of The Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life at Columbia and Barnard said he hoped the move would be a \"wake up call\" for campus leadership.",
      "\u201cColumbia has an antisemitism crisis, and for months, I have worked with faculty, staff, students, parents, and alumni to urge the administration to act quickly to address this crisis and avoid lasting damage to the University,\" Cohen said in a statement. \"I hope this federal action is a wake-up call to Columbia\u2019s administration and trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously so that these grants can be restored, the vital work of the University can continue, and that Columbia can become, once again, a place where the Jewish community thrives.\u201d",
      "Republicans have long-criticized universities and colleges for allowing pro-Palestinian protests to foment in response to the war in Gaza. On the campaign trail last year, Trump called protesters \"pro-Hamas radicals\" and called for them to be deported.",
      "And even the Biden administration criticized several university presidents after they sidestepped questions from House Republicans during a hearing about antisemitism on college campuses several months after the Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "That hearing led to calls for the three university presidents who participated \u2014 Claudine Gay of Harvard University, Elizabeth Magill of the University of Pennsylvania and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0\u2014 to resign. Eventually, Gay and Magill did step down.",
      "During Trump's first term, his administration cut public funding for education only once, when it withheld $4 million in grants from Chicago Public Schools, allegedly over the school system's poor handling of sexual assault allegations."

    "story": [
      "The United States added 151,000 jobs in February as employers in a range of industries continued making hires, while the federal government slashed its workforce by 10,000.",
      "The fresh employment data reported Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics missed expectations for 170,000 new roles, but last month's job gains exceeded the revised 125,000 posted in January. The unemployment rate climbed slightly to 4.1% from 4.0% the month before.",
      "The BLS data painted a mixed picture of the labor market. Health care employers added 52,000 roles in February, financial services firms added 21,000, and transportation and warehousing companies added 18,000. But Friday's report may not fully capture the extent of President Donald Trump's sweeping policy changes.",
      "\"The survey period for this report is around the 12th of the month,\"  Mark Hamrick, Bankrate senior economic analyst, said in a statement Friday. \"Much has happened since then,\" he said, nodding to the 62,000 federal job cut announcements flagged Thursday by the consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, all but dismissed the BLS report as \u201ca snapshot of a prior age, before the shift in federal government policies undermined confidence.\u201d",
      "Still, analysts broadly sounded a note of measured relief.",
      "\"There were fears that today\u2019s jobs report would reveal some deeply unsettling news around the health of the labor market,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a statement Friday. \"Yet, while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labor market is cooling.\"",
      "The sharp decline in government roles, which comes as Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency effort pursues deep cuts to the federal workforce, more than wiped out the 5,000 jobs added there in January. It's the first time that federal employment has fallen since June 2022.",
      "Some Wall Street firms have estimated the potential job losses triggered by DOGE could ultimately total 500,000, though Barclays analysts have argued that the broader economic impact may be limited. Federal payrolls account for just 1.5% of overall jobs, and even knock-on effects to contractors wouldn\u2019t dramatically alter the labor market picture, they said.",
      "The number of people working part time for economic reasons swelled by 460,000 to hit 4.9 million, the highest level since the pandemic, the BLS found. At the same time, the number of \u201cdiscouraged\u201d workers \u2014 those who want jobs but believe none are currently within reach \u2014\u00a0shrank by 128,000.",
      "Less than two full months into office, Trump has whipped up storm clouds for the otherwise solid economy he inherited, promising to overhaul it to address voters\u2019 widespread discontent.",
      "Wall Street traders and analysts have increasingly sounded alarms about the impact of policy uncertainty on the economy. But market reaction to Friday's report was relatively muted. Stocks are likely to close down for the week, having fully erased the gains accrued since Trump won re-election in November.",
      "\u201cWe are likely to see some headwinds as we move through the year,\u201d Sarah House, Wells Fargo senior economist, said Thursday ahead of the BLS report. \u201cIt\u2019s not just tariffs we\u2019re contending with but also slower immigration. That\u2019s going to affect labor force growth, and then we now have pretty aggressive efforts to curtail government spending.\u201d",
      "Consumer confidence has taken a downturn as households shift more focus from spending toward saving. Meanwhile, the combination of Trump\u2019s still-evolving tariff agenda and the massive job cuts sought by Musk, his multibillionaire adviser, have raised the twin specters of higher unemployment and higher prices, with increasing invocations of stagflation.",
      "In the run-up to Friday\u2019s BLS numbers, two unofficial reports showed a job market that was throttling back: Job cut announcements in February reached their highest one-month level since the depths of the pandemic in mid-2020, the Challenger report found.",
      "Earlier this week, the private sector payrolls processor ADP tallied 77,000 net gains in February, far fewer than the 148,000 forecast. The decline included recent tech layoffs in the information services sector and losses in education and health services \u2014 jobs that often rely on federal grants.",
      "\u201cHere you might see some uncertainty as policies are being digested and assessed,\u201d Nela Richardson, ADP chief economist, said in a call with reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what this represents, but we are seeing a measurable decline in hiring in key sectors of the economy.\u201d",
      "With uncertainty rising, major retailers warn that they\u2019re likely to ask customers to pay for some of the cost increases from Trump\u2019s tariffs. Target and Best Buy raised alarms about that likelihood this week, days before the White House offered temporary reprieves for some of the duties it announced. Walmart, too, has warned it won\u2019t be entirely \u201cimmune\u201d from the new import taxes on America\u2019s top trade partners.",
      "The BLS report showed Friday that retailers shed 6,000 jobs, but the sector's average employment levels have held steady over the past year."

      "\u201cBased on the fact that Russia is absolutely \u2018pounding\u2019 Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",
      "While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, however, Trump said the U.S. was \"doing well\"  with Russia and that he was \"finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\"They don\u2019t have the cards,\" Trump said of Kyiv. \"In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia which is surprising, because they have all the problems, and they\u2019re bombing the hell out of 'em right now.\"",
      "Asked if he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of the U.S., Trump said he doesn't think so and wants to put an end to the war and reach a settlement. Trump said he would talk \u201cat length\u201d with Putin about Ukraine, maintaining that Russia would never have invaded had he remained in office and blaming Biden.",
      "Trump also addressed his administration's decision to halt military aid and intelligence help to Ukraine and was asking what Ukraine will do if they run out of resources.",
      "\"I have to know that they want to settle. I don\u2019t know that they want to settle. If they don\u2019t want to settle, we\u2019re out of there because we want them to settle and I'm doing it to stop death,\" said Trump, who then suggested that Europe needs to ramp up its contributions to Ukraine, \"I watched over the last week or so what\u2019s going on in Europe. This thing could end up in World War III if we don\u2019t get it settled.\"",
      "National Security Adviser Mike Waltz chimed in and said that he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio plan to meet with a Ukrainian delegation next week in Saudi Arabia \"to get these talks back on track\" to reach a cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump's sanctions threat against Russia comes a week after an intense Oval Office clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy scuttled hopes for a much-anticipated rare earth minerals deal. The meeting added to growing concerns that U.S. policy toward Russia was softening and set off a scramble in Europe about who would fill the void if the U.S. pulled its support of Ukraine.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday seemed to preview additional sanctions on Russia in remarks before the Economic Club of New York. He said that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place and is prepared to go \u201call in\" if it would \"provide leverage in peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cPer President Trump\u2019s guidance, sanctions will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Bessent also accused the Biden administration of imposing \"weak sanctions\" on Russia's energy sector, which he said played a \"major factor in the Russian war machine's continued financing.\" Bessent charged that Biden took a softer approach to sanctions due to \"worries about upward pressure on U.S. energy prices during an election season.\"",
      "Bessent also claimed that the Biden administration lifted U.S. sanctions on Russia in January, but it's unclear what he was referring to. Ten days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Treasury Department implemented sweeping sanctions on Russia's energy sector and there's no evidence that the U.S. eased sanctions.",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a post on Telegram Friday, Zelenskyy called for a truce in the air and at sea after Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine overnight against the country\u2019s energy infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIn total, the Russians launched nearly 70 missiles, both cruise and ballistic, as well as almost 200 attack drones,\" Zelenskyy said. \"All of this was directed at infrastructure that ensures normal life. Repair and restoration work is already underway wherever needed. Unfortunately, there is also damage to residential buildings.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to take the path to peace, and Ukraine has wanted peace from the very first second of this war. The goal is to force Russia to stop the war,\" he said.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was able to defend its airspace using F-16 aircraft and Mirage-2000 jets provided by France. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reassured Ukraine that Europe will continue to defend it against Russian aggression even if the U.S. chooses not to continue its assistance."

      "About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.",
      "The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.",
      "In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.",
      "Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.\u201cThere\u2019s no longer improvement,\u201d Heggins said, as he began to cry. \u201cMy son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.\u201d",
      "The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.",
      "The DHA previously said the new contracts would \u201cimprove health care delivery, quality, and access\u201d for U.S. beneficiaries.",
      "This situation has become untenable.",

      "In a statement to NBC News, DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues.Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.",
      "\u201cThis situation has become untenable,\u201d said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.",
      "Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.",
      "Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.",
      "\u201cThere are times where I\u2019m like, what am I going to do?\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of providers\u2019 records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.",
      "The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.",
      "The company said it has been \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.",
      "\u201cWe have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.\u201d",
      "TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.",

      "Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are \u201calways slightly slower\u201d in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.",
      "\u201cThis time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,\u201d the officials said. \u201cAdditionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about people who are suicidal,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It\u2019s very hard to transfer therapists. It\u2019s really hard to open up again.\u201d",
      "Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "\u201cIt might spiral someone down to a deep depression,\u201d Wise said.",
      "In Clarksville, Tennessee, Jenne Nesbitt-Decker, owner and chief financial officer of Mariposa Behavioral Health Services, a small clinic that treats children and teens who have autism, said she has had\u00a0to cut the number of available appointments in half to make up for the lack of payments and the loss of one provider who quit.",
      "If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.",
      "There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association\u2019s acting director of government relations.",
      "\u201cThat exacerbates an already difficult problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families? That\u2019s really troubling.\u201d",
      "The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.",
      "His son\u2019s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.",
      "While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.",
      "\u201cIf my insurance won\u2019t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,\u201d he said.",
      "Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife\u2019s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.",
      "\u201cIt would be incredibly difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.\u201d"

    "summary": "Speaker Johnson is seeking to pass a bill with GOP votes alone. The government will shut down one week from today unless the House and Senate can agree on a funding package.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Friday he will bring a \u201cclean\u201d stopgap funding bill to a House vote next week to avert a government shutdown, as Democratic leaders blasted the emerging legislation by warning that it could cut money for health care, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits.",
      "That leaders from the two parties haven\u2019t agreed on a path to keep the government open yet raises the chances of a shutdown at the end of next Friday, when federal funding expires.",
      "Johnson hasn\u2019t yet unveiled the measure, known as a continuing resolution or CR, but has said it would keep the government\u2019s lights on through the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.",
      "Bipartisan talks have hit a wall and Johnson is seeking to pass the bill with only Republican votes. But he has a razor-thin 218-214 majority, and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has already said he will vote against the stopgap bill. That means Johnson cannot afford another GOP defection.",
      "The speaker is also grappling with some of the near-term spending changes requested by the White House \u2014 like higher immigration enforcement funding and cuts to the IRS \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear which provisions will make it into the bill. And Democrats want guardrails to prevent President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk from unilaterally slashing agencies and spending directed by Congress.",
      "Johnson said the bill would hit the floor \u201cearly next week, probably on Tuesday.\u201d He added Friday on Fox News that once it passes the Republican-controlled House, \u201cwe\u2019ll see if there are grown up Democrats in the Senate.\u201d",
      "In the Senate, the bill would require at least seven Democrats to pass the 60-vote threshold. If Congress can\u2019t send a stopgap bill to the president\u2019s desk by March 14, the government would shut down less than two months into Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Congress had passed a short-term funding bill last December, but it only funded the government through March 14.",
      "What\u2019s unclear is if any vulnerable House Democrats, facing tough reelections bids in 2026, will break with their leadership and support Johnson\u2019s eventual bill, which is backed by Trump. If enough House Democrats vote for it, it could pressure a handful of Senate Democrats to sign on as well.",
      "For now, the two parties appear far apart just seven days before funding expires.",
      "As Johnson appeared on Fox News, the top three House Democratic leaders \u2014 Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar \u2014 sent a letter to their rank-and-file members accusing Republicans of bringing forward a \u201cpartisan continuing resolution that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is not acceptable,\u201d the leaders wrote.",
      "\u201cWe cannot back a measure that rips away life-sustaining healthcare and retirement benefits from everyday Americans as part of the Republican scheme to pay for massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors like Elon Musk. Medicaid is our redline.\u201d",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, quickly shot back at the letter from Democrats: \u201cHouse Democrats admitted they wanted a government shutdown, and now they\u2019re following through.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the top four House and Senate appropriators are working on a parallel track and said they are nearing a deal on top-line spending numbers for the 12 appropriation bills for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.",
      "It\u2019s not clear at the moment what will become of those negotiations given that there are less than seven months left in the fiscal year and the legislative calendar is being crowded out by other items.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s imminent,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Wednesday of the potential deal. \u201cLet\u2019s get the process started. We all want to make sure that money that is appropriated goes to where it\u2019s been intended to go. I want to get to full-year appropriations bills.\u201d",
      "She also reiterated Democratic opposition to Johnson\u2019s continuing resolution.",
      "\u201cThe first thing to do, in my view, is to make sure that there isn\u2019t a full-year CR,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure the other side has the votes, but that\u2019s up to them.\u201d",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said one possibility is to pass Johnson's stopgap bill to buy negotiators more time, continue negotiating a longer-term deal, and later pass individual appropriations bills.",
      "\u201cThe speaker is very insistent that we go all the way\u201d with a CR, \u201cso I agree with that decision. \u201cObviously, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t keep negotiating,\u201d Cole told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday.",
      "He ruled out the possibility of passing a weeklong or weekslong continuing resolution that would keep pressure on Congress to get a broader funding deal that would serve as a framework for the 12 bills.",
      "\u201cI want to do all 12; I\u2019m crystal clear about that. But we can\u2019t have a situation where we have a government shutdown threatened every two weeks. We have other things to do. Obviously, we have a reconciliation bill to do,\u201d Cole continued.",
      "\u201cI mean, the speaker\u2019s told us, \u2018Keep negotiating.\u2019 We prefer a deal,\u201d he said."

      "Donald Tusk added that Poland would also drastically expand its arsenal, saying the country \u201cmust pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons.\"",
      "Tusk unveiled the plans in a speech to the Polish Parliament on the same day that President Donald Trump, after weeks of weakening U.S. support for Ukraine and traditional European allies, threatened to impose expanded \u201clarge scale\u201d sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it reaches a peace agreement with Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats,\" Tusk said.",
      "Many of Poland's leaders were shocked when Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago. Once behind the so-called Iron Curtain under Communism and controlled by the Soviet Union, Poland is a longtime enemy of Russia.",
      "Tusk told lawmakers he also wants to increase the size of the Polish army to 500,000, from its current level of around 200,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the need to have an army of half-a-million in Poland, including the reservists,\u201d he said.",
      "Polish women may also be required to undergo military training, Tusk said, but \u201cwar is still to a greater extent the domain of men.\"",
      "That said, there are more than 7,000 women currently on active duty in the Polish army, according to government figures. And there is a long history of Polish women fighting for their country on the front lines, including as guerrilla fighters during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Germans.",
      "Currently, the Ukrainian army has 800,000 soldiers and is fighting a Russian force that numbers around 1.3 million, Tusk said.",
      "As a member of NATO, which was set up after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, Poland has been one of the most dependable U.S. allies as well as a stalwart supporter of Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.",
      "But the Polish government has become increasingly worried about the country\u2019s security since Trump made the false claim that the Ukrainians had started the war with Russia and then halted U.S. military aid\u00a0and\u00a0intelligence help\u00a0to Ukraine.",
      "Trump also has a history of questioning the U.S.'s traditional responsibilities as a member of the U.S.-led alliance.",

    "summary": "USDA pest experts were abruptly fired last month \u2014 swept up in the Trump administration\u2019s frenzied and turbulent efforts to drastically shrink the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Jonah Ulmer was the federal government\u2019s foremost authority on tiny invasive pests that most Americans have never heard of \u2014 but which can decimate crops across the U.S.",
      "Known as thrips and psyllids, the gnat-sized insects often sneak into the country on imported flowers and produce \u2014 and it was the job of Ulmer and his colleagues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify and quarantine highly destructive species that appear on perishable goods during the inspection process required at U.S. ports of entry.",
      "But Ulmer was abruptly fired last month \u2014 swept up in the Trump administration\u2019s frenzied and turbulent efforts to drastically shrink the federal workforce. He's one of at least 145 workers in plant protection alone who were terminated, including entomologists, soil conservationists and tree climbers who hunt for pests, according to a list of terminated job titles obtained by NBC News.",
      "Overall, nearly 6,000 probationary workers \u2014 new employees who\u2019d been on the job less than a year or workers who\u2019d been promoted\u00a0\u2014 were eliminated from USDA, including other highly trained scientists and technical staff stationed across the country to help customs officers screen imported items, identifying and quarantining those infested with dangerous pests.",
      "As the national taxonomist for thrips and psyllids, Ulmer knew there wasn\u2019t a single person left at the agency with the expertise that he had \u2014 and he knows the consequences of making a mistake can be dire.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t ever be wrong. You always have to be right,\u201d Ulmer told NBC News. \u201cThe one that you identify as a nonquarantine pest, and it comes in the country and wreaks havoc? The impacts of that could be millions or billions of dollars in economic damage.\u201d",
      "A court this week ordered USDA to temporarily reinstate for at least 45 days probationary employees whom it fired, but it\u2019s not clear when they\u2019re going back to work \u2014 or for how long, especially since President Donald Trump has made his intention to gut the federal workforce very clear.",
      "The USDA did not respond to requests for comment. But the terminations have dealt a serious blow to the federal inspection process required for imported food, plants and other organic matter \u2014 a program that the agency calls \u201cessential\u201d to preventing infestations and disease outbreaks from crippling America\u2019s trillion-dollar agricultural economy.",
      "The cutbacks could have severe, sweeping economic consequences for American farmers and consumers alike. Though USDA inspections \u2014 which are conducted jointly with U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2014 are continuing at ports of entry, the loss of both staff and expertise raises the risk that harmful pests and diseases will slip into the U.S. unnoticed, industry representatives and agriculture experts said.",
      "\u201cMaybe a year from that we can\u2019t grow peppers or cucumbers in the U.S. because we have these pests,\u201d said Christine Boldt, executive vice president of AFIA, a trade group that represents flower importers. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that those threats don\u2019t happen overnight \u2014 they happen over time.\u201d",
      "So far, Boldt says that she\u2019s received assurances from USDA and CBP officials that inspection staffing in Miami \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest entry point for cut flower imports \u2014 hasn\u2019t been altered.\u00a0\u201cBut they say afterwards, \u2018Every day that could change,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "The most significant pest that Ulmer handled was the Asian citrus psyllid. Only 3 to 4 millimeters long, the insect carries a plant disease that has devastated Florida\u2019s iconic citrus industry. Another type of invasive pest known as the chilli thrip loves to devour strawberries, cotton and pepper plants, and it is notoriously difficult to contain once it invades a crop. \u201cThey develop pesticide resistance really rapidly,\u201d Ulmer said. \u201cSo the best option is prevention and quarantine.\u201d",
      "Unfamiliar species also show up all the time, prompting Ulmer and his colleagues to comb through the vast Smithsonian insect collection or rush to their labs to perform dissections on tiny specimens.\u00a0Last year in California, citrus growers were hit by new species of invasive fruit flies that reproduce inside the pulpy flesh, rendering the fruit inedible.",
      "\u201cYour fruit has to be stripped and destroyed \u2014 it\u2019s a significant financial impact,\u201d said Casey Creamer, president and CEO of California Citrus Mutual, a trade group for citrus growers, who stressed the importance of maintaining USDA staffing and expertise to protect the industry. \u201cNobody wants to open up a piece of citrus fruit and find larvae.\u201d",
      "The USDA also fired one of the federal government\u2019s only experts in invasive land snails and slugs, which can be enormously detrimental to crops.",
      "",
      "\u201cThey will indiscriminately eat most things \u2014 soybean, corn, or specialty crops like strawberries and blueberries,\u201d said Morgan Bullis, the snail and slug expert who lost her job as a national taxonomist last month. Slugs can also transmit diseases like rat lungworm to humans when they crawl over produce like lettuce.",
      "Every single day, Ulmer and Bullis would flag dangerous pests that needed to be quarantined \u2014\u202fand were specifically sent to their national lab because regional identifiers weren\u2019t sure if the strange bug that fell out of a flower or slithered over a wooden pallet posed a true threat.",
      "\u201cWhen we had these first rumors about the probationary terminations, they told us not to worry, because we are so critical to the American economy, they couldn\u2019t even believe that we would be hit,\u201d a USDA official said, requesting anonymity out of fear of retribution.",
      "The loss of agency expertise and staff also threatens to increase costs for importers because of inspection delays \u2014 and could ultimately raise prices of ordinary goods for U.S. consumers.",
      "The USDA inspections are highly time sensitive, as the inspections must be completed before agricultural goods are allowed through.\u00a0Fewer USDA pest experts and staff could mean inspection delays and thousands of dollars of additional storage, shipping and refrigeration fees for importers, according to Michael Lahar, manager of regulatory affairs for A.N. Deringer, a U.S. customs broker.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to do the best they can, but it\u2019s going to result in slowdowns. Slowdowns are going to result in extra costs. Extra costs are going to trickle down to the average American,\u201d Lahar said. \u201cSo when you go into the supermarket, and you want to buy a dozen roses for your sweetheart to bring home, they\u2019re going to be more expensive.\u201d",
      "Ulmer started at the USDA in October, replacing a national expert who had been at the agency for more than 16 years before retiring.",
      "He was stationed at his laboratory on Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 one of the busiest times of the year given the influx of cut flowers \u2014 when he was abruptly notified that he was being terminated. He was in the midst of categorizing a new type of destructive psyllid that had just started showing up at U.S. ports on exotic flowers shipped from southern Africa.",
      "While workers were told they were fired for \u201cperformance\u201d issues, Ulmer and many other workers said that they had received praise for their work and never had performance-related complaints. And since their division is largely funded through their user fees that importers pay, staff cuts don\u2019t mean big savings for taxpayers.",
      "Ulmer is still waiting to receive any word about if or when he will be reinstated at the USDA, and he has no expectation that he\u2019ll still have a job after the 45-day period is over.",
      "But right now, he is eager to get back to his lab and start working through the big pile of insect identifications that he knows will be waiting for him.",
      "\u201cThe insects don\u2019t care what the current political environment is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to keep coming.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Celebrated Canadian author Louise Penny announced Friday that she will be boycotting the U.S. due to President Donald Trump's plan to put tariffs on all goods from Canada.",
      "In a statement posted to her official Facebook account, the murder mystery novelist called Trump's actions \"an unprovoked trade war against Canada,\" and said she does not feel she can enter the U.S. \"until that economic sword, that could throw hundreds of thousands of Canadians (as well as Americans) into poverty, is removed completely.\"",
      "Trump imposed tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico Tuesday, before walking some of them back two days later. The president is now threatening to implement tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber as early as Friday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday slammed Trump's tariffs as \"a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "The novelist called her decision not to travel to the U.S. \"painful,\" adding that she has made many personal and professional friends stateside.",
      "\"But\u2026enough,\" she wrote. \"What is happening is not just a potential economic catastrophe for Canada and so many other nations, it is a moral wound.\"",
      "Penny also announced that she will no longer do in-person events in the U.S., ending a 20-year stint of touring the country. The creator of the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache novels was planning a launch event for the 20th installation of the series, \"The Black Wolf,\" at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., but will now be hosting it in Ottawa at the National Arts Centre on Oct. 28.",
      "\"Please understand this decision is not meant to punish Americans,\" she wrote in her statement. \"This is about standing shoulder-to-shoulder with my fellow Canadians.\"",
      "The author said she hopes Americans will still attend her Canadian events, where they \"will be welcomed with open arms.\"",
      "Penny is best known for her Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series, which was turned into the 2022 Amazon Prime miniseries \"Three Pines.\" The eight-episode series featured British-American actor Alfred Molina as Gamache, a charismatic and talented inspector solving crimes in Quebec.",
      "The author also co-wrote the 2021 political mystery thriller \"State of Terror\" with Hillary Clinton. The book kicks off with a new U.S. president choosing a political enemy as secretary of state and avalanches into a series of terrorist attacks from political adversaries that the administration must address.",
      "A representative for Louise Penny did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Friday announced that it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University \"due to the school\u2019s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"",
      "The move comes just days after the administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified Columbia that it was going to conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the university's federal grants and contracts.",
      "The task force includes staffers from the Justice Department, Health and Human Services Department, Education Department and the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "In a statement explaining the cancellation of certain federal grants Friday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon implied that Columbia had not complied with federal antidiscrimination laws.",
      "\u201cSince October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses \u2014 only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,\u201d she said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cUniversities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the announcement, Columbia committed to engaging with the Trump administration on the issue in the hopes of restoring the lost federal funds.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing the announcement from the federal agencies and pledge to work with the federal government to restore Columbia\u2019s federal funding. We take Columbia\u2019s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to\u00a0combatting antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff,\" a spokesperson for the university told NBC News.",
      "In a post on X later Friday, McMahon said that she had a \"productive meeting\" with the university's interim president Katrina Armstrong.",
      "\"Had a productive meeting with Columbia\u2019s interim president Katrina Armstrong today. Look forward to working together to protect all students on their campus. The Trump Administration will not allow the continued harassment and threats of violence against students,\" the education secretary wrote.",
      "This comes after Columbia and other universities became the site of large pro-Palestinian protests following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The Biden administration investigated Columbia and other universities multiple times for alleged violations of antidiscrimination laws.",
      "First, in 2023, the Department of Education opened investigations into Columbia and six other colleges and universities for potential violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",
      "Last May, the Education Department again launched an investigation into Columbia, that time looking into anti-Palestinian discrimination.",
      "On Friday, Leo Terrell, senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights and the head of the Justice Department Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, said in a statement that canceling these federal funds \"is one of the tools we are using to respond to this spike in anti-Semitism.\"",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" he added.",
      "After the Trump administration's announcement, Brian Cohen, the executive director of The Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life at Columbia and Barnard said he hoped the move would be a \"wake up call\" for campus leadership.",
      "\u201cColumbia has an antisemitism crisis, and for months, I have worked with faculty, staff, students, parents, and alumni to urge the administration to act quickly to address this crisis and avoid lasting damage to the University,\" Cohen said in a statement. \"I hope this federal action is a wake-up call to Columbia\u2019s administration and trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously so that these grants can be restored, the vital work of the University can continue, and that Columbia can become, once again, a place where the Jewish community thrives.\u201d",
      "Republicans have long-criticized universities and colleges for allowing pro-Palestinian protests to foment in response to the war in Gaza. On the campaign trail last year, Trump called protesters \"pro-Hamas radicals\" and called for them to be deported.",
      "And even the Biden administration criticized several university presidents after they sidestepped questions from House Republicans during a hearing about antisemitism on college campuses several months after the Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "That hearing led to calls for the three university presidents who participated \u2014 Claudine Gay of Harvard University, Elizabeth Magill of the University of Pennsylvania and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0\u2014 to resign. Eventually, Gay and Magill did step down.",
      "During Trump's first term, his administration cut public funding for education only once, when it withheld $4 million in grants from Chicago Public Schools, allegedly over the school system's poor handling of sexual assault allegations."

      "President Donald Trump warned that he may implement tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber as early as Friday, in what amounts to the latest broadside by his administration in the brewing trade war between the United States and Canada.",
      "Trump has whipsawed on tariffs in recent days, imposing sweeping levies on Tuesday before paring back some of them, including goods from Mexico and Canada covered under the countries' USMCA trade agreement.\u00a0Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed the new tariffs as \u201cvery dumb\u201d earlier this week.",
      "Trump, however, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, said there is more to come on tariffs, and possibly soon, over policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers.",
      "\u201cCanada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products,\u201d Trump said, and cited what he said was Canada\u2019s roughly 250% tariff on dairy products \u201cwhich is taking advantage of our farmers\u201d and which he promised to match.",
      "\u201cWe may do it as early as today, or we\u2019ll wait until Monday or Tuesday,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to charge the same thing. It\u2019s not fair. It never has been fair, and they\u2019ve treated our farmers badly.\u201d",
      "Trudeau this week said he expected the trade war to be ongoing \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d as tensions between the two leaders rise. Trump has referred to Trudeau as a \u201cgovernor\u201d repeatedly, under the implication that Canada could become the 51st state.",
      "Trump took questions from reporters on other pressing economic policy decisions, touting the one-month reprieve that he had offered automakers and explaining his comments warning of potential \"disturbances\" in the economy.",
      "Asked why he had called on Congress to overturn the bipartisan CHIPS and Sciences Act, Trump said the incentives it provided were no longer needed for companies to set up business in the U.S., making it \u201ca waste of money.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Trump said of the landmark bill that was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump called the legislation \u201ca horrible, horrible thing\u201d in a joint address to Congress and directed House Speaker Mike Johnson to \u201cget rid of\u201d it, and use \u201cwhatever is left over \u2026 to reduce debt. Congressional Republicans have largely indicated they do not plan to move forward with Trump's demand.",
      "Responding to a question about the prospect of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, after threatening sanctions on Russia earlier today after a bombing campaign by Moscow, Trump said he has faith that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to bring to a close the multiyear war.",
      "\u201cI believe him,\u201d Trump said of Putin."

      "Twenty-three people \u2014 mostly unvaccinated children \u2014 have been hospitalized in West Texas.",
      "A 6-year-old in Texas died last week, and on Wednesday, Lea County health officials reported a suspected measles death in an adult.",

But at least one of the photos in that collection about an all-female C-17 crew could still be accessed. A shot from the Army Corps of Engineers titled \u201cEngineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month\u201d was deleted.",

      "Also still visible was an image of then-Pfc. Christina Fuentes Montenegro becoming one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps\u2019 Infantry Training Battalion and an image of Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves.",
      "It was unclear why some other images were removed, such as a Marine Corps photo titled \u201cDeadlift contenders raise the bar pound by pound\u201d or a National Guard website image called \u201cMinnesota brothers reunite in Kuwait.\u201d",
      "Why the database?",
      "The database of the 26,000 images was created to conform with federal archival laws, so if the services are queried in the future, they can show how they are complying with the law, the U.S. official said. But it may be difficult to ensure the content was archived because the responsibility to ensure each image was preserved was the responsibility of each individual unit.",
      "In many cases, workers are taking screenshots of the pages marked for removal, but it would be difficult to restore them if that decision was made, according to another official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that were not public.",
      "A Marine Corps official said every one of its images in the database \u201ceither has been taken down or will be taken down.\u201d The Marines are moving on the directive as fast as possible, but as with the rest of the military, very few civilian or contractor employees at the Pentagon can perform content removal, the official said.",
      "In the Marine Corps, just one defense civilian is available to do the work. The Marine Corps estimates that person has identified at least 10,000 images and stories for removal online, and after further review, 3,600 of those have been removed. The total does not count more than 1,600 social media sites that have not yet been addressed.",
      "Many of those social media sites were military base or unit support groups created years ago and left idle. No one still has the administrative privileges to go in and change the content.",
      "The Marine official said the service is going through each site and getting new administrative privileges so it can make the changes.",
      "On Feb. 26, the Pentagon ordered all the military services to spend countless hours poring over years of website postings, photos, news articles and videos to remove any mentions that \u201cpromote diversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d",
      "If they couldn\u2019t do that by Wednesday, they were told to \u201ctemporarily remove from public display\u201d all content published during the Biden administration\u2019s four years in office."

      "She politely shut him down. \u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that.\u201d",
      "Sara then walked out of the ceremony and sat in a car to process the situation with her mom, Kathy, and sister, Lisa.",
      "She assured her family she was fine and mentioned her pod conversation with Ben about BLM as one of the reasons she couldn\u2019t marry him. She said she often wondered if their relationship was just \u201csurface, fun, carefree love\u201d and worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Ben remained at the ceremony with his friends. Together, they prayed for him and Sara. Ben said he wanted to unpack everything with Sara, but the couple did not communicate the rest of the episode.",
      "Instead, Sara further explained her decision to the cameras. She said the two were \u201cnot a good fit\u201d and that she could not continue the \u201ccycle\u201d of them trying to sort through their different values.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ben said that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Sara\u2019s choice while she offered more insight into their relationship",
      "She said that she had to \u201cconstantly give him the benefit of the doubt\u201d when they disagreed.",
      "Sara added, \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential.\u201d Even though they didn\u2019t get married, she said she still believed love is blind and that she was proud of herself.",
      "What happened at the reunion?",
      "Fans will find out if Sara and Ben reconciled after their abrupt breakup at the reunion, which arrives March 9 at 9 p.m. ET/ 6 p.m. PT on Netflix."

      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",

Virginia\u2019s father hugged Devin and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a very good man. I\u2019m disappointed also, but I think you\u2019re a great guy.\u201d",
      "She explained her decision in a confessional.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn\u2019t get to. We just didn\u2019t get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn\u2019t get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",
      "\u201cWould you get engaged with me?\u201d he asked.",

      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Nicolle later takes Joey and Monica's engagement photos and appeared to come around \u2014 but Joey was still doubtful, as he says in Episode 13.",
      "In the finale, Joey and Monica chose not to get married. Monica felt that Joey wasn't completely ready and he agrees at the altar.",
      "\"If Joey had told me with his words, \u2018I am 100% in. It is you. I know it\u2019s you. I\u2019m certain.\u2019 I feel like it could have been a lot different,\u201d\u00a0she said in a confessional.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appeared to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "But by the finale, her tune had changed. Sara decided not to marry Ben \u2014 who seemed shocked and, in his words, \"devastated\" by her decision. Sara cited their differing values and political beliefs as one of her reasons.",
      "Ben wanted to continue dating but Sara seemed to balk. \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential,\" she said.",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",

    "story": [
      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller's relationship appeared to be smooth sailing from the moment they connected in the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods.",
      "The connection was instantaneous once the duo met and soon realized they attended the same high school. Despite finding themselves in a bit of a love triangle with fellow show contestant Brittany Dodson, Buckley and Miller got engaged sight unseen in the pods.",
      "The newly engaged couple quickly put their relationship to the test in the real world and sought to answer the question: Is love really blind?",
      "As the couple heads to the altar during the final installment of shows from this season, let's take a look back at their \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d journey.",
      "What happened between Virginia and Devin in the pods?",
      "Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had chemistry with Virginia, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, early on in the dating experiment. The pair quickly discovered that they\u2019d attended the same high school, albeit a few years apart. Luckily, the age difference didn't seem to phase the pair.",
      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to keep choosing the wrong guy,\u201d she said, adding that she hasn't had many good examples of healthy relationships in her life.",
      "Virginia called Devin \u201cquite refreshing\u201d and said she'd never dated a \u201cnice guy\u201d before. In a confessional interview, Devin called Virginia a \u201ckind, loving, genuine person.\u201d",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a letter for Virginia to declare his love. At the end, he asked if she would marry him, and the two got engaged.",
      "What happened in Honduras?",
      "Devin and Virginia appeared to be on cloud nine while vacationing in Honduras.",
      "\u201cYou make love so easy,\u201d Devin told his new fianc\u00e9 while they were strolling on the beach. \u201cI love that,\u201d she replied.",
      "After spending more time together, Virginia declared that she felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with Devin and he agreed.",
      "What happened when Virginia and Devin moved in together?",
      "The couple got to know each other more once they returned home from the group vacation and soon moved into an apartment together.",
      "While talking about financial assets, Virginia said she'd like to get a prenuptial agreement and Devin said he'd \u201cnever really thought about that.\u201d",
      "The topic of a prenup came up yet again when Virginia met Devin\u2019s family. They seemed taken aback by the idea and worried that Virginia might already have one foot out the door. Still, Virginia politely stuck to her belief that a prenup is simply \u201cthe modern way of doing things.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Devin agreed to sign the prenup, noting that it was pretty straightforward.",
      "The couple differed on their political views",
      "Politics were somewhat of a point of contention for Devin and Virginia. In Episode 10, they had a serious conversation about their political views after Virginia encouraged Devin to open up about serious topics that could impact their marriage.",
      "Devin said he wasn't \u201csuper big into politics\u201d and didn't have a \u201cstrong stance on it.\u201d He then explained that his family typically has conservative views.",
      "Virginia was open to differing political opinions, but noted that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if Devin was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.",
      "Did Virginia and Devin get married?",
      "As she prepared to walk down the aisle on their wedding day, Virginia reflected on her feelings for Devin.",
      "\u201cI feel very confident about my connection with Devin and I feel his love, and I feel very secure in our relationship. I love Devin and I absolutely see a future with Devin. He\u2019s all the things that I didn\u2019t even know I needed. And I\u2019m just blessed and really fortunate to be here,\u201d she said.",
      "Devin reiterated his fianc\u00e9's sentiments, saying, \u201cI'm happy that I get to marry the love of my life. I do think I hit the jackpot. She's one in a million, just a smart, loving, kind human being. But also on the outside, she's very beautiful.\u201d",
      "When the time came to take the plunge, Devin said \u201cI do\u201d before Virginia expressed her hesitations.",
      "\u201cI love you so much, but I'm just not ready,\u201d she declared, much to the surprise of her father, who expressed shock at his daughter's revelation.",
      "Devin began crying and Virginia said, \u201cI'm just not ready. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\u201d After walking away, Virginia's father hugged Devin, saying, \u201cYou're a very good man. I'm disappointed also, but I think you're a great guy.\u201d",
      "What did Virginia and Devin say about the wedding?",
      "In a confessional interview, Virginia elaborated on her decision to not get married, saying she felt \u201creally bad\u201d for hurting Devin and his family. She explained that she felt the need to \u201cprotect\u201d Devin throughout their relationship, despite his hesitation to talk about certain topics like politics.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn't get to. We just didn't get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn't get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, Virginia revealed that Devin got a check for a wedding present, but failed to tell her about the gift. Instead, found out from his mother.",
      "\u201cI was just waiting to see if he would bring it up but he didn't. It made me not so trusting of him,\u201d she said.",
      "Although Virginia knew Devin would be hurt, she felt comfortable with her decision.",
      "\u201cIf my truth in that moment was to not get married, then that was my truth in that moment. I don't regret my decision,\u201d she said.",
      "In his own confessional interview, Devin said he felt \u201ckind of lost\u201d and was struggling to understand Virginia's decision.",
      "\u201cEven though I didn\u2019t get married today,\u00a0I still do believe that love is blind, because I felt that love for Virginia regardless of everything that happened,\u201d he said."

      "What happened between Taylor and Daniel in the pods?",
      "When Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, started talking with Daniel, a 30-year-old Sales Account Executive, they had instant chemistry.",
      "Daniel spoke about his sister, who is blind, and said he hopes to be \u201clike her\u201d and love people for who they are rather than what they look like.",
      "Taylor loved that sentiment and appreciated the fact that Daniel wanted to find the mother of his future children.",
      "Taylor and Daniel's love seemed that much more destined when they discovered their shared love of Christmas. Soon enough, they exchanged Christmas ornaments and stockings during dates.",
      "Taylor opened up about her father, who had been battling cancer recently, and said she was nervous she would get a call saying she had to go home. Daniel reassured her, saying that even if that happened, \u201cI hope that you would feel ok leaving and I would find you.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen the doors first opened and I saw Daniel, I thought, \u2018He\u2019s so familiar to me.\u2019 But I couldn\u2019t place it. Is he familiar cause I\u2019ve pictured\u00a0his face through a wall 15 million times? Is he familiar cause I\u2019ve heard his voice? I have this overwhelming feeling that when the doors opened last night, that was not the first time that he saw me,\u201d she explained.",
      "Taylor elaborated on the matter, saying that she had received an Instagram follow request a few months before that might have been Daniel. If that was true, it's possible that Daniel knew what Taylor looked like all along.",
      "Taylor confronted Daniel about the matter in person, but he denied following her on social media. Producers allowed her to go through her phone and consult a followers app that tells you who has followed you. She was unable to find a follow request from Daniel and admitted that she felt bad bringing it up.",
      "Daniel reassured Taylor that it was ok, saying, \u201cI\u2019d love to go to Honduras with you. If you have reservations about that, I\u2019d love to go back home with you. Either way, wherever you go, I\u2019m in,\u201d he said.",

They enjoyed a drama-free trip to Honduras and continued to strengthen their connection when they moved in together. But, they hit their first obstacle when Monica\u2019s older sister, Nicolle, expressed some concerns. She said Joey\u2019s wasn\u2019t her sister\u2019s usual type.

Monica said she was nervous after arriving at the venue and shared that it had been \u201cuncomfortable\u201d for her during the experiment to \u201ctrust in (Joey\u2019s) words rather than see his emotions.\u201d She explained that he wasn\u2019t romantic or affectionate, which made her hold back. It was a sentiment that Monica revealed during her final date with Joey the previous episode, the first time viewers learned that she had some concerns.",
      "While Joey prepared for their big day, he also expressed his doubts. He said he worried Nicolle, Monica's sister, was not being \u201cgenuine\u201d when they met a second time. \u201cShe basically said you have my blessing but not my support,\u201d he recalled.",

We just didn\u2019t get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn\u2019t get to it,\u201d Virginia said.

After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",

He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier.

Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house.

Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3.

The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",

Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back.

They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\"",
      "Tom Sandoval",
      "Episode 10 began with the sole remaining Traitor successfully recruiting a new ally before the two secretly escaped to the turret to weigh their options for the next murder. They agreed that Tom Sandoval was close to figuring out their identities and needed to go. When the \"Vanderpump Rules\" star spotted a letter from the Traitors, he immediately let out a maniacal chuckle. \"I knew it!\" he said before reading that he had been eliminated from the game. \"I was expecting this. Who's the most threatening of the guys? Obviously me,\" he theorized. He added, \"I've enjoyed this so much and I didn't realize I was going to be so good at it. It's kind of f---ing cool.\" Tom then applauded himself for how he played the game and how the other players perceived him. \"Overall, I was a pleasure to work with, for the most part, and valued, respected and that's all I could ask for,\" he concluded.",
      "Danielle Reyes",
      "Danielle Reyes played Season 3 of \"The Traitors\" like she had nine lives to spare. But in the finale, her luck ran out. Episode 11, titled \"The Day of Reckoning Is Upon Us,\" immediately resolved the cliffhanger from the previous episode. After a split vote between the \"Big Brother\" star and Lord Ivar Mountbatten, the other players voted again to determine who would go home. After misreading an expression from Dolores Catania, Britney Haynes voted to send Danielle home, accidentally betraying her closest ally. Clearly hurt by Britney's mistake, Danielle shared kind words with the cast before she left. But when she mentioned Britney, she simply said, \"Wow.\" Danielle continued, \"I said I was going to come into this game and play for my family, by any means necessary. And, of course, I'm definitely a Traitor.\" In her last confessional, Danielle said she felt \"stupid\" and \"embarrassed\" that Britney eliminated her.",
      "Britney Haynes",
      "As the last Traitor standing, Britney Haynes tried her best to make it to the end. But Danielle's departure made the others suspicious that she had been working with her fellow \"Big Brother\" alum. At the final roundtable in Episode 11, Dylan Efron said that Britney was the only player left that he doubted. She countered by arguing that Dylan was also close with Danielle and made some shady moves. But, her attempt to rally the votes did not work. Britney became the final player banished from the game. As she left, Britney said, \"Think of me when the wind blows. I hope you freeze.\" She was not allowed to reveal her identity as a Traitor. In her last confessional, she said, \"I felt like my case against Dylan was so strong. I was coming in hot with the facts, which were all very valid facts by the way. But Dylan's a little too smart. Danielle kept him around way too long.\" She concluded, \"Whether I lived or died, I wanted to at least set this place on fire on my way out.\"",
      "Who won the Traitors Season 3?",
      "At the end of the finale, the final four players gathered with Cumming in front of the castle. They all voted to end the game and revealed their were Faithfuls. The group hugged and celebrated winning $204,300 together. \u201cIt\u2019s the most Faithfuls to ever win,\u201d Gabby Windey said. \u201cAnd honestly, it feels so good!\u201d",

To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",
      "While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, however, Trump said the U.S. was \"doing well\"  with Russia and that he was \"finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\"They don\u2019t have the cards,\" Trump said of Kyiv. \"In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia which is surprising, because they have all the problems, and they\u2019re bombing the hell out of 'em right now.\"",
      "Asked if he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of the U.S., Trump said he doesn't think so and wants to put an end to the war and reach a settlement.

The meeting added to growing concerns that U.S. policy toward Russia was softening and set off a scramble in Europe about who would fill the void if the U.S. pulled its support of Ukraine.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday seemed to preview additional sanctions on Russia in remarks before the Economic Club of New York. He said that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place and is prepared to go \u201call in\" if it would \"provide leverage in peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cPer President Trump\u2019s guidance, sanctions will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Bessent also accused the Biden administration of imposing \"weak sanctions\" on Russia's energy sector, which he said played a \"major factor in the Russian war machine's continued financing.\" Bessent charged that Biden took a softer approach to sanctions due to \"worries about upward pressure on U.S. energy prices during an election season.\"",
      "Bessent also claimed that the Biden administration lifted U.S. sanctions on Russia in January, but it's unclear what he was referring to. Ten days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Treasury Department implemented sweeping sanctions on Russia's energy sector and there's no evidence that the U.S. eased sanctions.",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "\u201cIn total, the Russians launched nearly 70 missiles, both cruise and ballistic, as well as almost 200 attack drones,\" Zelenskyy said. \"All of this was directed at infrastructure that ensures normal life. Repair and restoration work is already underway wherever needed. Unfortunately, there is also damage to residential buildings.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to take the path to peace, and Ukraine has wanted peace from the very first second of this war. The goal is to force Russia to stop the war,\" he said.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was able to defend its airspace using F-16 aircraft and Mirage-2000 jets provided by France. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reassured Ukraine that Europe will continue to defend it against Russian aggression even if the U.S. chooses not to continue its assistance."

      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "\u201cWe will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats,\" Tusk said.",

And there is a long history of Polish women fighting for their country on the front lines, including as guerrilla fighters during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Germans.",
      "Currently, the Ukrainian army has 800,000 soldiers and is fighting a Russian force that numbers around 1.3 million, Tusk said.",
      "As a member of NATO, which was set up after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, Poland has been one of the most dependable U.S. allies as well as a stalwart supporter of Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.",
      "But the Polish government has become increasingly worried about the country\u2019s security since Trump made the false claim that the Ukrainians had started the war with Russia and then halted U.S. military aid\u00a0and\u00a0intelligence help\u00a0to Ukraine.",
      "Trump also has a history of questioning the U.S.'s traditional responsibilities as a member of the U.S.-led alliance.",
      "Even as Trump was threatening Moscow with sanctions Friday, he complained that he was \u201cfinding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.\u201d",
      "More than 7 million Ukrainians fled across the border into Poland in the early days of the war. And, as of February, nearly a million Ukrainian refugees remained in Poland, according to the latest statistics."

      "Romania\u2019s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, detained all six on Wednesday for forming a criminal group, which was initially set up in 2023 and had links to Russia.",
      "Police said the group was formed to allegedly undermine the \u201csovereignty and independence\u201d of the Romanian state by \u201cpolitically undermining the country\u2019s defense capacity.\u201d",
      "Investigations supported by Romanian intelligence services revealed that the group allegedly sought \u201cthe removal of the current constitutional order, the dissolution of political parties,\u201d and the installation of a new government formed by its members, police said.",
      "\u201cIn order to achieve their destabilizing objectives, representatives of the group actively requested support from officers within the Embassy of the Russian Federation,\u201d said Romania\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the SRI.",
      "The group had \u201ca military-type structure\u201d that aimed to negotiate withdrawal from NATO, which Romania joined in 2004, as well as the adoption of a new Constitution, country name, flag and anthem, police said.",
      "\u201cThe members of the criminal group would have repeatedly contacted agents of a foreign power, located both on the territory of Romania and the Russian Federation,\u201d police said.",
      "Two of the suspects allegedly traveled to Moscow in January this year, where police allege they had contact with individuals who supported the organization\u2019s \u201cefforts to take over state power in Romania,\u201d police added.",
      "Police raids and diplomatic expulsions raise tensions with Moscow",
      "On Wednesday, authorities raided eight homes in the municipality of Bucharest and the counties of Ilfov, Giurgiu, and Maramures, which police said yielded \u201cseveral pieces of evidence\u201d that were seized.",
      "The raids came the same day\u00a0Romania expelled two military diplomats from the Russian embassy\u00a0in Bucharest as tensions soar between Moscow and Bucharest.",
      "Romania\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the decision related to Russia\u2019s military, air and naval attach\u00e9, Victor Makovskiy, and his deputy, Evgeni Ignatiev, over alleged \u201cactivities that contravene the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.\u201d The ministry did not provide further details.",
      "\u201cThe two Russian diplomats carried out intelligence-gathering actions in areas of strategic interest and took actions to support the group\u2019s anti-constitutional actions,\u201d the SRI added in its statement Thursday. There was no immediate comment from Russia.",
      "On Wednesday, the Russian embassy described the expulsions as \u201cunfounded and unfriendly\u201d and said the embassy \u201creserves the right to take retaliatory measures.\u201d",
      "Russian state news agency TASS on Tuesday reported claims from Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency that the EU was seeking to interfere in Romania\u2019s upcoming presidential election. The SVR said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had asked Bucharest to bar Romanian presidential candidate\u00a0Calin Georgescu, who emerged as the frontrunner in last year\u2019s canceled election, from participating in the rerun in May.",
      "Georgescu has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d and called Ukraine \u201can invented state,\u201d but he claims not to be pro-Russian.",
      "The Constitutional Court made the\u00a0unprecedented move to annul the election\u00a0two days before the Dec. 8 runoff after Georgescu\u2019s\u00a0surprise first-round win. The far-right populist had polled in single digits and declared zero campaign spending, after which allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Moscow has denied interfering in the Romanian election process.",
      "Georgescu under investigation by prosecutors",
      "Romanian prosecutors\u00a0launched a criminal investigation against Georgescu\u00a0last week, accusing him of supporting fascist groups, \u201cincitement to actions against the constitutional order,\u201d and false declarations regarding electoral campaign financing and asset disclosures. On Thursday, a court in Bucharest also rejected an appeal by Georgescu that challenged judicial control measures imposed on him.",
      "Georgescu, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, said on Monday outside a court in Bucharest that it is \u201ca political case\u201d against him.",
      "The European Court of Human Rights on Thursday also rejected a complaint lodged by Georgescu on Dec. 16 after the election was annulled, in which he claimed the cancellation was unlawful and based on unsubstantiated accusations. The decision was final, the court said.",
      "In a separate case last week, Romanian authorities conducted 47 searches in five counties reportedly linked to some of Georgescu\u2019s associates, which uncovered a large cache of lethal weapons \u2014 including grenade launchers and guns \u2014 and several million dollars (euros) in cash of various currencies.",
      "Prosecutors said the allegations against the suspects included \u201cfalse statements regarding the sources of financing\u201d of an electoral campaign, illegal possession of weapons and initiating or establishing an organization \u201cwith a fascist, racist or xenophobic\u201d character.",
      "The first round of the rerun of the election is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate gets more than 50% of ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18.",
      "It isn\u2019t yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has talked with aides about favoring NATO members that spend a set percentage of their GDP on defense, sources told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is considering a major change\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S.\u2019 participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three current and former senior U.S. officials\u00a0and one congressional official.",
      "Trump has discussed with aides the possibility of calibrating America\u2019s NATO engagement in a way that favors members of the alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic\u00a0product\u00a0on defense, the officials said.",
      "As part of the potential policy shift, the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold, the officials said. If\u00a0Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5,\u00a0which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all\u00a0of them.",
      "The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S. may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials said. His administration has already signaled to America\u2019s European allies that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in Europe, and one option now under consideration is to reposition some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.",
      "Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, \u201cPresident Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, said Trump\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, \u201cgave very reassuring answers\u201d on the administration\u2019s commitment to NATO and Article 5.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.",
      "NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said in January after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "According to NATO\u2019s most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members\u2019 defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations\u00a0\u2014 Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. \u2014 spent more than 3% on defense.\u00a0Poland\u00a0had the highest percentage,\u00a0dedicating 4.12% of its GDP to defense.",
      "The potential shift in how the U.S. participates in NATO comes as Trump is pushing European allies to do more to aid Ukraine\u00a0in its war with Russia\u00a0and to play a major role in maintaining peace in the country if a\u00a0deal to end the war is reached.",
      "\u201cI was contacted by several European ambassadors concerned about rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday. Trump didn\u2019t announce anything at his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not given pause by everything about President Trump\u2019s statements and actions on foreign policy, you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d",
      "Trump threatened to withdraw\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0from NATO during his first term and has questioned the merits of Article\u00a05\u00a0for the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0The article was designed to protect European nations from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has been triggered just once, after the\u00a09/11\u00a0attacks on the U.S.",
      "Ukraine has sought NATO membership, but the Trump administration has said that would not be part of any negotiated peace deal."

      "He thanked the two women who testified against the \u201cparticularly cowardly and deceitful\u201d Zou and said there is evidence that he \u201cmay have potentially attacked as many as 50 other women in the same awful nature.\u201d",
      "Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact the force.",
      "During the trial, a call to police from one of the women led to questions over the quality of the interpreter made available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of severe regret that the victims didn\u2019t necessarily get that best translation at the time,\u201d Southworth added.",
      "Zou moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2017 to study mechanical engineering at Queen\u2019s University before heading to UCL in 2019 for a master\u2019s degree and then a Ph.D.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine may have enough weapons to fight Russia unaffected for a few weeks at least, but President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to stop sharing intelligence will cost civilian lives almost immediately, dismayed Ukrainians said Thursday.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to halt intelligence came as European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy, convened a\u00a0summit in Brussels as they attempt to cope with an upended landscape in which the Trump administration appears to be treating them with hostility while seemingly warming to the Kremlin.",
      "Miles away from these high-powered meetings, ordinary Ukrainians may have to confront the real-world consequences of the White House\u2019s U-turn.",
      "As Washington turns off the tap on its $65 billion of military aid, Ukraine will also now have to do without American intelligence that has helped it to anticipate Russian attacks and troop movements, and avoid nightly barrages from Russian drones on its cities and infrastructure.",
      "Viewed from the homes and apartments of Kyiv, it seems like \u201ca very petty decision by our alleged ally,\u201d said Myroslava Yeremkiv, 33, who manages donations at a nongovernmental organization in the capital. \u201cThe United States has the power at least to protect and save the lives of civilians from Russia\u2019s brutal and terrorizing attacks \u2026 and you just choose not to.\u201dThe White House cut off this intel feed following the disastrous Oval Office meeting last week between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. Though Trump\u2019s team hinted that the pause is a negotiating tactic to ensure Zelenskyy is \u201cready for peace,\u201d it has nonetheless shocked military and intelligence experts worldwide.",
      "That feeling is no less deeply felt in Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThis looks like a thug tactic \u2014 blackmailing and trying to break Ukrainian society into submission before negotiations,\u201d Yeremkiv said, calling it a \u201cvery weak and pathetic decision.\u201d",
      "In some of the first practical consequences of that rupture, U.S. shipments of weapons and equipment already en-route to Ukraine were halted Monday night, a U.S. defense official told NBC News. So immediate was that order, that planes carrying vital aid for the Ukrainian war effort turned around in the sky, they added.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope that in the near future we can restore sharing of this information,\u201d said Oleksandr Musiienko, head of the Kyiv-based Center for Military and Legal Studies. \u201cWe will lose some types of information about flying warplanes from Russian airfields, about launching their terrorist attacks,\u201d added Musiienko, who also serves in the country\u2019s Territorial Defense Forces. \u201cThis means that we do not have enough security and defense for our civilians.\u201dThe U.S. is not the only country providing military aid and intelligence. But it is by far Ukraine\u2019s largest single contributor of both. It will \u201cbe extremely difficult to fully compensate for this loss with our own capabilities or those of Europe,\u201d according to Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukraine government-backed think tank.",
      "Despite Moscow having the upper hand, Ukraine has slowed or even halted Russia\u2019s grinding winter advances. Kyiv has managed to shoot down most of the hundreds of Russian drones fired almost nightly at civilian targets in cities. That\u2019s partly down to $64 billion in American military assistance and $66 billion provided by all other countries combined, fueling Ukraine\u2019s fighting spirit that confounded predictions of swift Russian victory.",
      "At the European Union summit Thursday, Zelenskyy thanked the Europeans, who unlike Trump have committed to Kyiv\u2019s unconditional defense, which they see as a bulwark against wider Russian aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we are not alone,\u201d he told his fellow leaders.",
      "Some of this money covers intelligence, with U.S. know-how helping the Ukrainians to wield American-supplied materiel such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, and the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.Away from the battlefield, the decision to pull the plug \u2014 and\u00a0pull it so publicly \u2014 will send shock waves\u00a0through America\u2019s intelligence partners around the world, former officials said.",
      "\u201cThe signal it sends is atrocious,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is not a dependable ally.\u201d",
      "This message will also be heard loud and clear in Moscow.",
      "\u201cEvery day that passes without a solution can be costly for Ukraine, particularly if Russia decides to exploit this weakness,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst who is the head of intelligence at the Le Beck consultancy.",
      "\u201cThe spat is public. Russia knows about this, so they will try to take advantage.\u201d",
