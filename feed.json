      "The Florida Panthers have signed Canadian singer Michael Buble \u2014 for a good cause",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- The Florida Panthers have signed Canadian singer Michael Buble \u2014 for a good cause.",
      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",
      "The program is the brainchild of Panthers hockey operations president and general manager Bill Zito and his wife Julie Zito.",
      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",
      "The program formally launched in March and has been backed by famed artist Romero Britto along with NFL players \u2014 and South Florida natives \u2014 Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa, among others.",
      "Julie Zito is a cancer survivor, Bill Zito lost his mother and sister to cancer, and the Zito family recently lost a close friend to cancer as well. The couple got the inspiration for the artwork element of the initiative from the Cows on Parade public art project in Chicago; donors to the Panthers' project can decorate their panther statuette in any way they'd like.",
      "The team is hoping to raise at least $1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in all of our families and all of our friendships,\" said Zito, who joined the Panthers in 2020. \"It makes me more determined not to achieve a goal for the goal\u2019s sake, but to achieve a goal to bring people together.\u201d",

      "King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States",
      "TORONTO -- King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- The Chinese government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban international students from Harvard would harm America's international standing, and one university in Hong Kong looked to capitalize on the uncertainty by promising to take them in.",
      "Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard University\u2019s international student population. The university enrolled 6,703 international students across all of its schools in 2024, according to the school\u2019s data, with 1,203 of those coming from China.",
      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\u201cBut with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\u201d the CCTV commentary said.",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

      "\"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",

Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",

He was included in Billboard's 2012 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list recognizing rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans say Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream.",

      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",
      "In high school, he started a band with his friends and got signed with Victory Records right when they graduated. They toured for a few years, during which he made connections in the music industry that would help his foray into the business side.",
      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he demanded a second opinion at a Thursday court hearing.",

      "A county-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Carwyle found the defendant incompetent, Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge as he stood near his client with glass separating them. But Krauss said Carwyle, as is his right, would like an evaluation from a different psychiatrist.",

      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted, he could get up to three years in prison. If Carwyle is found incompetent again, the judge could order him to be sent to a state mental hospital for treatment and ongoing evaluation.",
      "Other than asking for the protective order for Aniston, prosecutors have not given their position on Carwyle's competency status, and did not speak at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Aniston became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "The music agency Sound Talent Group says three of its employees died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood on Thursday",
      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",
      "\u201cNo words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\u201d the band wrote.",
      "A representative for the band referred to their social post when asked about Williams\u2019 death.",
      "Parts of Shapiro\u2019s 1985 Cessna 550 Citation littered a large area, including fragments under the power lines and a section of wing on a road behind the homes, said Elliot Simpson of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",
      "And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego\u2019s University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.",

      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",
      "Inclusive pronouns and language \u201ccomplicate the language,\u201d she insists. Asked about author J.K. Rowling\u2019s anti-trans stance, her response is calmly dismissive: \u201cHer opinion counts no more than a baker\u2019s or a cleaning lady\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Bambi still stands \u2014 proud, elegant, unbowed \u2014 in a life spanning World War II to \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d",
      "When she first stepped onstage, the world had no words for someone like her. So she danced anyway. Today, the words exist. So do the rights. And the movements she helped inspire.",
      "\u201cI never wore a mask,\u201d she says softly, but firmly. \u201cExcept when I was a boy.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kid Cudi is the latest celebrity being called to testify at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2032 sex trafficking trial in New York.",
      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "His latest album, \u201cInsano,\u201d arrived last year. Soon after its release, \u201cInsano (Nitro Mega),\u201d a partner record that featured Wiz Khalifa, Pusha T, Steve Aoki and more, arrived.",
      "On May 9, Cudi released his latest single, \u201cNeverland.\u201d A short film of the same name, directed by Ti West and produced by Monkeypaw Productions, will premiere at Tribeca Film Festival this June.",
      "Also in May, Cudi officially launched his new apparel label, WZRD.",
      "Daring fashion has been a longtime passion for Cudi; the rapper has partnered with brands such as BAPE and Adidas. He collaborated with the late designer Virgil Abloh, and in 2021 channeled Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain by wearing an Abloh-designed Off-White floral dress on stage at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",

The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",

We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "Some of Spike Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival",
      "CANNES, France -- There\u2019s no sufficient way of explaining what it\u2019s like to be around Spike Lee, but his new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d comes pretty close.",
      "The main character, played by Denzel Washington, is a Knicks fan who won\u2019t tolerate Celtics green in his house. A framed jersey of Jalen Brunson hangs in his Brooklyn apartment. There are movie references peppered throughout, of \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Smell of Success.\u201d Yankee Stadium plays a pivotal setting. In one scene, Nicholas Turturro even yells directly into the camera: \u201cBoston sucks!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not counting on Boston for box office!\u201d Lee says with a roaring cackle during an interview on a rooftop terrace in Cannes. \u201cWe might as well just write that off.\u201d",
      "Some of Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival. The premiere of \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cHigh to Low,\u201d came shortly before the Knicks begin their Eastern Conference finals matchup with the Indiana Pacers. Everywhere Lee has gone at the French Riviera festival, he\u2019s gone in blue and orange, including a pinstripe suit on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a film by a New Yorker who loves New York. But if you\u2019re not that, it doesn\u2019t detract from you enjoying it. You could be from \u2026 (Lee raises an eyebrow) \u2026 Indiana,\u201d Lee says before letting out a maniacal roar. \u201cWait a minute, we got to write off another market, too!\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d which A24 releases in theaters Aug. 22 before it streams on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5, was one of the most eventful premieres of Cannes. Washington was surprised with a Palme d\u2019Or. (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t acting,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. Only three or four people knew.\u201d) Washington also got in an angry tangle with a photographer on the red carpet after his arm was grabbed.",
      "\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve told that photographer: \u2018Do not touch Denzel Washington or it\u2019s going to be a (expletive) problem,\u2019\u201d Lee says, laughing. \u201cThe headline, \u2018Man on Fire,\u2019 hoooooo! That was a good headline.\u201d",
      "Lee then picks up the digital recorder lying in front of him and says in a calm, professional voice: \u201cLadies and gentleman, this is a public service announcement. Do not put your hands on Mr. Denzel Washington. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Thank you very much.\u201d",
      "But Lee, 68, has been more than happy to mix it up in Cannes. Before an interview, he taunted European journalists about his adopted Premier League team, Arsenal. At the press conference earlier in the day, he quoted Yoda for his primary message to film students: \u201cThere is no try, only do.\u201d Said Lee: \u201cAre you faking the funk or are you serious?\u201d",
      "Lee, who last debuted 2018\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d in Cannes, tried to avoid saying anything too pointed about President Donald Trump. But couldn\u2019t help himself when asked about the moral decisions that mark \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we can talk about American values considering who is president,\u201d Lee told reporters.",
      "Lee was also on an apology tour at the festival. Four years ago, he was the head of the jury that awarded Julia Ducournau\u2019s \u201cTitane\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or. Only Lee, confused by the French-language ceremony, accidentally revealed the winner too soon. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a big one,\u201d said Lee, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going down in the history of Cannes.\u201d",
      "Just ahead of Lee's interview with The Associated Press, Ducournau, in Cannes with her \u201cTitane\u201d follow-up, \u201cAlpha,\u201d crossed the terrace to warmly embrace him. Recalling \u201cTitane,\u201d Lee said, \u201cA car impregnates a woman? You gotta win. You got my vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has been referred to as a remake of \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d but the degree to which it\u2019s a Spike Lee joint surprised festivalgoers. Washington plays David King, a wealthy record label executive whose son, along with the son of his friend and driver (Jeffrey Wright), is kidnapped for ransom. The kidnapper, played by A$AP Rocky, accidentally releases the wrong young man, leaving King with the decision to fork over the $17.5 million ransom for a young man who\u2019s not his son.",
      "The film is, in part, an ode to Kurosawa, whom Lee discovered as a film student at NYU. He credits his \u201cRashomon\u201d as the basis of \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d He met Kurosawa briefly once and has an autograph from the Japanese master signed with a paint brush. \u201cI got to shake his hand,\u201d says Lee.",
      "\u201cI grew up with my mother taking me to musicals,\" he says. \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d was one. If you listen to that great song by Rogers and Hammerstein with Julie Andrews singing it. What did Coltrane do to it? That\u2019s my analogy. What Coltrane did to \u2018My Favorite Things,\u2019 I think that\u2019s what we did with this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is less driven as a Kurosawa homage than by Lee\u2019s own obsessions: New York, music, the moral dilemmas of a Black entertainer and, yes, that Boston sucks. Above all, it\u2019s another Lee protagonist forced to do the right thing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad you said that. I never thought about that connected to the decisions David King has to make,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBut what you see is the turmoil he\u2019s going through. He\u2019s going through it. A moral decision. Money on one hand, a life on the other.\u201d",
      "More than any recent film of his, you can sense Lee having fun. Back in New York. Back with Denzel. \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Lee and Washington\u2019s fifth film together but the first in 19 years after 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d \"It\u2019s not like we had to catch up,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe never lost a step.\u201d",
      "But Lee suspects \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d marks the end of their collaboration \u2014 one of cinema\u2019s greatest actor-director pairings, spanning \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d and \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what he says,\u201d Lee shrugs, citing Washington\u2019s retirement plans. \u201cAnd then the other day he\u2019s doing a film with the guy from \u2018City of God,\u2019 so. Denzel put that on himself: \u2018I\u2019m doing this thing and then I\u2019m retiring.\u2019 I\u2019ll believe it when he hangs it up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d reaches a blistering crescendo when King confronts Rocky\u2019s kidnapper in a basement recording studio. A kind of rap battle ensues that Lee gives much of the credit to Washington for. The actor improvised many of his lyrics, drawing heavily from Nas. (\"That was not scripted,\" says Lee. \u201cWe had to pay for that!\u201d)",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand. Denzel is such a powerful force. Not a derogatory term, but he\u2019s a beast. If you got somebody who don\u2019t got it, Denzel is going to slaughter them. SLAUGHTER,\" Lee explains. \u201cRocky is from Harlem, uptown. So I knew that he\u2019s not going to punk out. He\u2019s going to stand there, feet planted to the ground, as a heavyweight fight, blow to blow to blow.\u201d",
      "For Lee, the scene is a summation of what he loves about moviemaking and what delights him so much courtside at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see a championship fight, and that\u2019s what it is. That is, in boxing terms, a slugfest,\u201d says Lee. \u201dThat makes great cinema. It makes great sports. You\u2019ve got conflict. It\u2019s a battle, and they\u2019re slugging it out.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Rapper and actor Kid Cudi is expected to testify at the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sex trafficking trial, taking the witness stand either Wednesday or Thursday to tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs was enraged when she left him for a period of time in 2011 and began dating Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi. She said Combs left a large bruise on her back where he kicked her as she left his Los Angeles home for the last time that year.",
      "Prosecutors have contended in court filings that Combs was so upset that he arranged to have Cudi's convertible firebombed.",
      "A prosecutor said at the end of Tuesday's court session that Mescudi will be the third witness after a federal agent finishes testifying about what investigators found last year when they raided Combs\u2019 home in Florida.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his fame and fortune to oversee a two-decade-long racketeering enterprise that controlled Cassie and others through threats and violence.",
      "His lawyers say evidence in the case reflects domestic violence, not anything amounting to a criminal racket or sex trafficking.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi several times in 2011 to work on music. She said her relationship with Cudi began late in the year and she got a burner phone so the two could communicate without Combs learning about it.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in so-called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that involved sexual performances with male escorts that Combs watched and sometimes participated in. It was during one of those \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that Combs picked up her regular phone and noticed communications that revealed Cassie was seeing Cudi, Cassie said.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie's mother, Regina Ventura, testified that she received an email in December 2011 from Cassie saying that Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Afterward, Regina Ventura said, she received a demand from Combs for $20,000. Scared for her daughter's safety, she went to the bank and sent Combs the money, only to have it returned by Combs days later.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother's Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and stayed for three or four days. She said she broke up with him.",
      "\u201cIt was just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much danger, too much uncertainty of, like, what could happen if we continued to see each other.\u201d",
      "Cassie said she told her family she was going to Los Angeles after the holidays to \u201cget to work.\u201d But instead, she said, she traveled after New Year's to meet Combs in Arizona, where he had gone to visit a college with his son. They resumed their relationship.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country, Combs told her that Cudi's car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi's friends there to see it, Cassie said.",

      "Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet",
      "PARIS -- Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet.",
      "The bust taken in 1988 from P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by a financial anti-corruption unit, Paris police said in an Instagram post Monday.",
      "There was no immediate word on whether the bust would be returned to the grave or what other investigation might take place.",
      "Morrison, the singer of Doors classics including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cBreak on Through,\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d was found dead in a Paris bathtub at age 27 in 1971.",
      "He was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the city's cemetery that is the final resting place of scores of artists, writers and other cultural luminaries including Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein and Edith Piaf.",
      "The 300-pound bust made by Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin was added to the grave in 1981 for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death.",
      "\u201cI think it would be incredible if they put the bust back onto where it was and it would attract so many more people, but the cemetery wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold that many people,\u201d Paris tour guide Jade Jezzini told The Associated Press. \u201cThe amount of people who would rush in here just to see the bust to take pictures of it, it would be incredible.\u201d",
      "Known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants, theatrical stage presence and mystical manner, Morrison has inspired generations of acolytes who congregate at his grave to reflect and sometimes to party, including a major gathering for the 50th anniversary of his death. The site has often been covered with flowers, poetic graffiti and liquor bottles left in tribute.",
      "He was undergoing a cultural renaissance when the bust was stolen in the late 1980s, which peaked with the 1991 Oliver Stone film \u201cThe Doors,\u201d in which Val Kilmer, who died in April, played Morrison.",
      "London artist Sam Burcher recently returned to the now more subdued grave site that she first visited 40 years ago when the sculpture of Morrison was still in place.",
      "\u201cThe bust was much smaller than all of these grand tombs.

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",

      "She said that she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for \u201cstrategic areas\u201d where it can help as the United States cuts foreign aid.",

      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",

      "There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year \u2014 including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas \u2014 and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses.",
      "Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.",
      "Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.",
      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "\u201cThere's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,\u201d Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. \u201cSNAP is about helping families in need get healthy food into their diets, but there's nothing nutritious about the junk we're removing with today's waiver.\u201d",
      "Six other states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia \u2014 have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or, in some cases, expanding access to hot foods for participants, according to the USDA.",
      "The push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the SNAP program has been key focus of Rollins and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Rollins called Monday's move \u201ca historic step to Make America Healthy again.\u201d",
      "Details of Nebraska's waiver, which takes effect Jan. 1, weren't immediately available. Anti-hunger advocates criticized it, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens and increases stigma for people already facing food insecurity.",
      "The waiver \u201cignores decades of evidence showing that incentive-based approaches \u2014 not punitive restrictions \u2014 are the most effective, dignified path to improving nutrition and reducing hunger,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "SNAP is a roughly $100 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans and is run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and administered through states.",
      "The program is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used \u201cfor any food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for everything from bottled water and soda to chips, ice cream and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "Until now, USDA rejected the waivers, saying there were no clear standards to define certain foods as good or bad. In addition, the agency had said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly, and would not necessarily change recipients' food purchases or reduce health problems such as obesity.",

      "Investigators are combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",
      "The facility was closed for the day.",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

    "story": [
      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s always on to the next fight,\u201d he said.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",
      "Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been grappling with a response to the U.S. cuts as well as reduced outlays from other traditional Western donors who are putting more money toward defense and less toward humanitarian aid.",
      "Matthew Kavanagh, the director of Georgetown University\u2019s center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said other countries have used the \u201cU.S. disruption\u201d \u2014 the cut in aid \u2014 \u201cas cover to do their maneuvering, with many countries in Europe reducing aid.\u201d",

      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",
      "Tedros calls the treaty \u201ctruly historic\u201d and said it \u201ccan make the world safer\u201d by boosting collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics.",
      "The treaty\u2019s effectiveness will face doubts when the U.S. \u2014 which poured billions into speedy work by pharmaceutical companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 is sitting out, and because countries face no penalties if they ignore it, a common issue in international law.",
      "Kavanagh said passage of the treaty \u201ccould be a significant victory \u2014 evidence that the U.S. government may no longer be indispensable in global health\u201d and could offer an opportunity for developing nations in the \u201cglobal South\u201d over the longer term.",
      "In the run-up to the assembly, WHO has been cleaning house and cutting costs. Its management has presented a budget for the next two years at just under $4.3 billion, which is 22% less than originally planned \u2014 largely in response to Western funding cuts.",
      "At a meeting on its budget last week, Tedros \u2014 a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister \u2013 announced a shake-up of top management that included the exit of key adviser Dr. Michael Ryan from the job as emergencies chief.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",

      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",

      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",

      "\u201cThe road to membership is not easy, so my message today is to stay on the course and to take next steps necessary towards the opening of the negotiations,\" Kallas said. \u201cNorth Macedonia faces era-defining choices for its citizens and its future.\u201d",
      "Key among those steps is a constitutional amendment to formally recognize a Bulgarian minority \u2014 a condition set by EU neighbor Bulgaria to lift its veto of North Macedonian membership. The issue has become a political flashpoint in North Macedonia, where the conservative government insists that EU accession should not be affected by bilateral disputes.",
      "Although the European Union has not accepted any new members since Croatia's accession in 2013, the war in Ukraine and concerns for broader European stability have refocused efforts to advance membership bids.",
      "\u201cThe integration of the Western Balkans into the EU is the best recipe for peace and security,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cWe are ready to support North Macedonia in strengthening the rule of law, fighting corruption, and modernizing public administration.\u201d",
      "North Macedonia and Albania began membership talks with the EU in 2022 after years of delays, largely driven by Bulgaria\u2019s veto over cultural and historical disagreements with Skopje. Albania has since moved ahead in the process.",
      "Mickoski reiterated his position that Bulgaria must first approve North Macedonia\u2019s membership before any constitutional change.",
      "\u201cWe belong in the EU not because someone owes it to us, but because we\u2019ve built a democracy based on European values,\u201d the prime minister. \u201cWe expect fair treatment and consistent leadership from the Union.\u201d",
      "Kallas\u2019 visit to Skopje was part of a broader two-day tour of the Western Balkans. Six regional countries are at various stages of EU accession. Montenegro and Albania lead the process, while Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, and North Macedonia lag behind.",

      "The protesters gathered outside the Serbian government building in downtown Belgrade demanding that the authorities revoke measures brought so far against protesting university professors and deans, and abolish plans to change education laws they say would scrap the autonomy of the state-run universities.",
      "University students, backed by their professors, have led massive protests that started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in Serbia's north in November, killing 16 people. Many in Serbia blamed the tragedy on alleged widespread government corruption that they say fueled negligence and flawed work on the station building renovation.",
      "The populist government of President Aleksandar Vucic has accused the students and university professors of allegedly working for unspecified Western powers to oust the government and \u201cdestroy\u201d Serbia.

    "story": [
      "Human rights organizations, politicians and experts have sharply criticized a law approved by El Salvador\u2019s Congress this week that seeks to limit foreign influence and corruption",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Human rights organizations, politicians and experts have sharply criticized a law approved by El Salvador's Congress as a censorship tool designed to silence and criminalize dissent in the Central American nation by targeting nongovernmental organizations that have long been critical of President Nayib Bukele.",
      "The law proposed by Bukele was passed Tuesday night by a Congress under firm control of his New Ideas party, and bypassed normal legislative procedures. Bukele first tried to introduce a similar law in 2021, but after strong international backlash it was never brought for a vote by the full Congress.",
      "Bukele said the law is intended to limit foreign influence and corruption. It comes after the government took a number of steps that have fueled concerns that the country may be entering a new wave of crackdowns. Critics warn that it falls in line with measures passed by autocratic governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China.",
      "Here are more details about the root of the criticism:",
      "Anyone \u2014 individual or organization, local or foreign \u2014 who acts in the interest of a foreign entity or receives foreign funding to operate in El Salvador is required to register under the law. Every payment, whether in cash, goods, or services, made to such groups will be subject to a 30% tax. The final law passed does not specify how the money from the tax will be used.",
      "While the United States also has a law that requires individuals working on behalf of foreign entities and governments to register, Bukele's is far broader in scope and grants him greater powers. It is fairly common in poorer countries in Latin America to depend on international aid dollars, as it\u2019s often difficult to raise money in their own countries.",
      "Analysts say a broad definition of a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in the law could cover:",
      "\u2014 Human rights organizations",
      "\u2014 Community associations",
      "\u2014 Independent media outlets",
      "\u2014 Foreign-funded startups or businesses",
      "\u2014 Religious groups",
      "\u2014 International aid agencies",
      "The law creates a new government body called RAEX, or Registry of Foreign Agents, which will have wide powers, including setting requirements for registration, approving or denying applications, revoking or refusing to renew registrations and to demand documents or information at any time.",
      "Some NGOs can apply for exceptions, but RAEX will decide who can operate in the country. Around 8,000 NGOs operate in El Salvador and often depend on foreign donations due to lack of funds available in the Central American nation.",
      "Some of those groups have long been at odds with Bukele and have criticized some of his actions, including waiving key constitutional rights to crack down on the country's gangs and seeking reelection despite clear constitutional prohibitions.",
      "The rules NGOs will have to follow:",
      "\u2014 They must register with RAEX and report the source and purpose of all donations.",
      "\u2014 They must keep complete accounting records, use the banks for transactions and follow anti-money laundering laws.",
      "\u2014 They cannot operate without registering.",
      "\u2014 They cannot engage in political activities or actions seen as threatening public order or national security.",
      "\u2014 They cannot use foreign donations for undeclared activities or share information on behalf of foreign donors without labeling it as such.",
      "Violations of the rules can lead to fines between $100,000 to $250,000, and possible closure.",
      "Critics say Bukele revived the law because he has now consolidated power across all branches of government. His political alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump has emboldened him.",
      "Bukele announced the law shortly after a protest near his home ended in a violent crackdown by police and two people being arrested.",
      "It comes after a number of moves by Bukele that have raised concerns that the self-described \u201cworld's coolest dictator\u201d is cracking down on dissent.",
      "\u2014 Just two days before the law passed, the government arrested an anti-corruption lawyer with the human rights organization Cristosal \u2013 one of Bukele's most outspoken critics \u2013 on corruption charges.",
      "\u2014 The government arrested the heads of bus companies for defying an order from Bukele posted on his social media.",
      "\u2014 Journalists with the investigative news organization El Faro said they had to flee the country after receiving word the government was preparing orders for their arrest after they published reports on the president's links to gangs.",
      "\u2014 Opposition lawmaker Claudia Ortiz called the law \u201can authoritarian tool for censorship\u201c and said it hands the president excessive levels of control. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that exemptions will only be given to groups that align with the government, while those who expose corruption or abuse will be punished,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2014 Lawyer Roxana Cardona of the NGO Justicia Social y Controlar\u00eda Ciudadana said: \u201cThe Foreign Agents Law seeks to suppress organizations that promote civic participation or support marginalized groups the state ignores.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Eduardo Escobar, director of Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, added: \u201cThis is part of the government\u2019s increasing repression. It affects constitutional rights like freedom of expression and freedom of association.\u201d",

      "Venezuelans are again finding themselves as pawns in their country\u2019s political game",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- As Venezuelans head to a Sunday election, they are again being used as political pawns. Opposition factions are urging abstention while the ruling party aims to tighten its grip on power \u2014 all while both sides appeal to the U.S. government for decisions that would have a greater impact on people\u2019s lives than the vote\u2019s results.",
      "The election for members of the National Assembly, governors and other regional offices will be the first to allow broad voter participation since last year\u2019s presidential contest, which President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence to the contrary.",
      "The contest comes as the opposition\u2019s most recognizable figure, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, remains in hiding to avoid arrest and most other leaders are in exile or prison due to the government's repressive measures unleashed after the July election.",
      "\u201cWe lost confidence in voting. On July 28, they made fun of us,\u201d said Carmen Medina, who sells plastic jewelry in the capital, Caracas. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to vote.\u201d",
      "A nationwide poll conducted between April 29 and May 4 by the Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed that only 15.9% of voters expressed a high probability of voting Sunday. Of those, 74.2% said they would vote for the candidates of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela and its allies, while 13.8% said they would vote for contenders associated with two opposition leaders who ignored Machado\u2019s call to boycott the elections.",
      "Sociologist Roberto Brice\u00f1o, director of the independent Laboratory of Social Sciences research group, said many Venezuelans no longer see their vote as a tool to \u201cgenerate change or improve the country\u2019s dire situation.\u201d After July\u2019s election, he said, people are living with a \u201cpersistent sadness about the future\u201d as \u201cthey feel they did their part\u201d to get someone other than Maduro elected.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s most recent economic troubles pushed year-over-year inflation in April to 172%, bringing the price of food and other basic goods for a family to $409 a month, according to a group of economists. Meanwhile, the value of the monthly minimum wage, paid to state employees in Venezuelan bolivares, dropped to $1.36, which they supplement with a roughly $100 monthly government bonus and second or third jobs.",
      "The latest chapter in the 12-year crisis even prompted Maduro to declare an \u201ceconomic emergency\u201d last month.",
      "At the heart of the recent challenges of the oil-dependent economy is the status of a U.S. government-issued permit that determines the activities of energy giant Chevron Corp. in Venezuela.",
      "The company has become responsible over the past two years for about 20% of Venezuela\u2019s oil production and a regular infusion of U.S. dollars that ultimately helped the government maintain an artificially low currency exchange rate. That rate is crucial to Venezuelans as it determines the prices of food, goods and services.",
      "Chevron\u2019s permit, formally known as a general license, was granted by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. But under Donald Trump, the White House rescinded it in February, giving Chevron time to wind down its operations in the South American country and meeting one of Machado's appeals.",
      "The U.S.'s decision to either stick to the rescission, or fulfill Maduro\u2019s wish to extend Chevron\u2019s wind-down period beyond its May 27 expiration date, will have a greater, more immediate effect on Venezuelans than the result of Sunday's poll.",
      "That is because Maduro\u2019s government controls seemingly every aspect of the country, including health and social services, utilities and education. It also deploys its repressive apparatus against opponents by, for instance, disqualifying a candidate after the election or appointing a ruling-party loyalist to oversee the elected offices held by opposition members, rendering them powerless.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Machado supporter, on Wednesday posted on X that Chevron's oil license will expire as scheduled, contradicting statements from Trump\u2019s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, who after meeting with Maduro\u2019s negotiators Tuesday said it would be extended by 60 days.",
      "Asked for clarity on Rubio and Grenell\u2019s differing positions, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said \u201cSecretary Rubio, as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, is representing the Administration\u2019s position.\u201d",
      "The ruling party-loyal National Electoral Council will oversee Sunday\u2019s election for state legislators, 285 members of the unicameral National Assembly and all 24 governors, including the newly created governorship purportedly established to administer Essequibo, a region long under dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana.",
      "Earlier this month, the Electoral Council moved to remove the QR code that previously appeared on the tally sheets that every electronic voting machine used in an election printed after polls closed. The tally sheets are considered the ultimate proof of election results, and their QR codes were used by Machado\u2019s team to show that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez defeated Maduro by a more than 2-to-1 margin in July.",
      "Some opposition factions, including Machado\u2019s, are using social media to urge people to not vote Sunday, arguing that casting votes legitimizes Maduro\u2019s government. But voters have grown accustomed to opposition leaders promoting boycotts on and off for years without delivering the promised change.",
      "The strategy is destined to fail again without unanimity.",
      "\u201cThe government has co-opted some opposition (parties) and there\u2019s other opposition that are just tired of this strategy that\u2019s never worked,\u201d said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for 30 years. \u201cSo, what you are going to have is a partial boycott, which means the government is going to cruise to victory and can say, \u2018We had elections, the opposition didn\u2019t participate.' It\u2019s going to backfire on the opposition.\u201d",

      "ISLAMABAD -- The death toll from a school bus bombing in southwestern Pakistan rose to eight on Friday after three more critically wounded children died, according to the country\u2019s military, which blamed rival India for allegedly supporting rebels behind the attack.",
      "The victims included two soldiers who were aboard the bus when it was attacked Wednesday in Khuzdar, a city in Balochistan province, where a separatist insurgency has raged for decades. A total of 53 people, including 39 children, were wounded in the attack.",
      "The children were going to their Army Public School when the bombing happened.",
      "Military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said that several of the wounded children remain critical. He said an initial investigation suggested the bombing was carried out by insurgents from the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which was designated a terrorist organization by the United States in 2019, on India's instructions.",
      "Sharif said Pakistan had evidence that India is orchestrating \u201cterrorists attacks inside Pakistan\" and the international community should take its notice. India has not responded to the allegation and Pakistan has presented no proof to back up its claim.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing.",
      "Tensions between India and Pakistan remain high after the two sides earlier this month engaged in a four-day border conflict before agreeing to a cease-fire.",

    "story": [
      "The British government has signed a deal to transfer the Chagos Islands\u2019 sovereignty to Mauritius",
      "LONDON -- Bernadette Dugasse was just a toddler when her family was forced to leave her birthplace. She didn\u2019t get a chance to return until she was a grandmother.",
      "Dugasse, 68, has spent most of her life in the Seychelles and the U.K., wondering what it would be like to set foot on the tropical island of Diego Garcia, part of the remote cluster of atolls in the middle of the Indian Ocean called the Chagos Islands.",
      "Like hundreds of others native to the islands, Dugasse was kicked out of her homeland more than half a century ago when the British and U.S. governments decided to build an important military base there.",
      "After years of fighting for the right to go home, Dugasse and other displaced islanders watched in despair Thursday as the U.K. government announced it was formally transferring the Chagos Islands\u2019 sovereignty to Mauritius.",
      "While political leaders spoke about international security and geopolitics, the deal meant only one thing for Chagossians: That the prospect of ever going back to live in their homeland now seems more out of reach than ever.",
      "\u201cWe are the natives. We belong there,\u201d said Dugasse, who has reluctantly settled in Crawley, a town south of London. \u201cIt made me feel enraged because I want to go home.\u201d",
      "Dugasse was born on the Chagos Islands, which had been under the administration of Mauritius, a former British colony, until 1965, when Britain split them away from Mauritius.",
      "Mauritius gained independence in 1968, but the Chagos remained under British control and were named the British Indian Ocean Territory.",
      "Dugasse was barely 2 years old when her family was deported to the Seychelles in 1958 after her father, a laborer, allegedly broke a work contract. They were never allowed back. Throughout the 1960s, many other islanders who thought they were leaving temporarily \u2013 for a holiday, or medical treatment -- would be told they cannot return to the Chagos.",
      "It turned out that Britain was evicting the entire population of the Chago Islands -- about 1,500 people descended from African slaves and plantation workers \u2013- so the U.S. military could build a base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "By 1973, all Indigenous Chagossians were forced to leave. Thousands of islanders and their descendants are now spread around the world, most living in Mauritius, the U.K. and Seychelles. Most want to return home.",
      "Britain\u2019s government has acknowledged that its removal of islanders was wrong, and has granted many citizenship and set aside some funds to improve their lives. But it continues to bar Chagossians from returning and living in their homeland, citing defense and security concerns and \u201ccost to the British taxpayer.\u201d",
      "Although the British government this week finalized a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos to Mauritius, ending a long contested colonial legacy, there is no upside for Chagossians.",
      "Dugasse and other islanders say they were completely excluded from political negotiations, and that Mauritius\u2019 government is unlikely to grant them any right to return. Under the deal, which still needs Parliament's approval, Britain will lease back the Diego Garcia military base for at least 99 years. That means the island will be off-limits for the foreseeable feature.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a Mauritian passport. I don\u2019t want to affiliate myself with Mauritius,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our own culture. We have our own identity. We are unique Indigenous people.\u201d",
      "Dugasse and another Diego Garcia native, Bertrice Pompe, sought to bring legal action against the British government over the deal to transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritian control. They only managed to halt the signing of the deal by a few hours Thursday.",
      "Pompe said it was a \u201cvery sad day\u201d but she wasn\u2019t giving up.",
      "\u201cThe rights we\u2019re asking for now, we\u2019ve been fighting for for 60 years,\u201d Pompe said outside a London courthouse. \u201cMauritius is not going to give that to us. So we need to keep fighting with the British government to listen to us.\u201d",
      "Human Rights Watch and other groups have urged Britain\u2019s government to recognize the Chagossians\u2019 right to return home, calling its failure to do so a \u201ccontinuing colonial crime against humanity.\"",
      "Dugasse \u2014 who received British citizenship but said she got no other compensation \u2014 has been allowed back to Diego Garcia just twice in recent years. Both times the visits were only possible with special permission from the U.K. government.",
      "She described the island as a \u201cmini-America,\u201d populated by American service members and Filipino staffers. She visited the church where her parents were married and where she was baptized, but found her village cemetery and school in ruins.",
      "And when she collected seashells and white sand from the beach, officials told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring those home.",
      "\u201cI told them no \u2014 (the shells and the sand) are mine, not yours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were allowed there for only nine days, and every day I cried.\u201d",
      "Dugasse said her elderly mother, who lives in the Seychelles, would like to die on Diego Garcia. She doesn't think that's possible \u2014 and she is pessimistic that any of her children or grandchildren will get a chance to see where their family came from.",
      "\u201cAre we Chagossians always going to be nomads, going from place to place?\" she asked. \"Most of the natives are dying. What will happen? It\u2019s time for us to set foot home.\u201d",

      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic, closing in on half a century of enmity.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Enrichment remains the key point of contention. Witkoff at one point suggested Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later began saying all Iranian enrichment must stop. That position on the American side has hardened over time.",
      "Asked about the negotiations, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said \u201cwe believe that we are going to succeed\u201d in the talks and on Washington's push for no enrichment.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians are at that table, so they also understand what our position is, and they continue to go,\" Bruce said Thursday.",
      "One idea floated so far that might allow Iran to stop enrichment in the Islamic Republic but maintain a supply of uranium could be a consortium in the Mideast backed by regional countries and the U.S. However, Iran's Foreign Ministry has maintained enrichment must continue within the country's borders and a similar fuel-swap proposal failed to gain traction in negotiations in 2010.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel has threatened to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities on their own if it feels threatened, further complicating tensions in the Mideast already spiked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Araghchi warned Thursday that Iran would take \u201cspecial measures\u201d to defend its nuclear facilities if Israel continues to threaten them, while also warning the U.S. it would view it as being complicit in any Israeli attack. Authorities allowed a group of Iranian students to form a human chain Thursday at its underground enrichment site at Fordo, an area with incredibly tight security built into a mountain to defend against possible airstrikes.",
      "Yet despite the tough talk from Iran, the Islamic Republic needs a deal. Its internal politics are inflamed over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past.",
      "Iran\u2019s rial currency plunged to over 1 million to a U.S. dollar in April. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue as a further collapse in the rial could spark further economic unrest.",
      "Meanwhile, its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d sits in tatters after Iran's regional allies in the region have faced repeated attacks by Israel during its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government during a rebel advance in December also stripped Iran of a key ally.",
      "The Trump administration also has continued to levy new sanctions on Iran, including this week, which saw the U.S. specifically target any sale of sodium perchlorate to the Islamic Republic. Iran reportedly received that chemical in shipments from China at its Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas. A major, unexplained explosion there killed dozens and wounded over 1,000 others in April during one round of the talks.",

      "In New Zealand\u2019s Parliament, every legislator has the chance to advance a proposed law, no matter how unpopular, thanks to an unusual lottery where bills are selected by random draw from a cookie tin",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Under the scrutiny of a black-robed official and before a hushed audience, a decorative cookie tin rattles like a bingo drum. Inside: the future of New Zealand \u2019s laws.",
      "The ceremonial lottery at Parliament, where bills are drawn randomly from what\u2019s known as \u201cthe biscuit tin\u201d in local parlance, is a way to ensure every New Zealand legislator has the chance to advance a proposed law, no matter how unpopular their bid. When a rare empty slot opens on Parliament\u2019s agenda, the battered metal cookie tin is produced from a glass case and its solemn and silly rite is hastily arranged.",
      "Inside the faded vessel with a peeling label might be an ambitious social initiative considered too risky for partisan support, a sensible but dull measure to tweak a statute, or a lawmaker\u2019s controversial hobby horse that their party wishes they\u2019d stop talking about. The tin doesn\u2019t judge.",
      "The quaintly patterned container, bought from a Wellington department store by a Parliament staffer in the early 1990s, might seem like a gag but the ritual selection of bills from it is a serious affair. Where decisions governing which bills are debated by legislators in Parliament are often determined by backroom brokering and subject to political gatekeeping, the cookie tin strikes an egalitarian note.",
      "\u201cWe ate the biscuits, got some bingo tokens numbered one through to 90, I think, and that is the way that the random numbers are drawn now, rather than any kind of computer system,\u201d said David Wilson, the Clerk of New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives. \u201cWhich has become quite an iconic part of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Most laws that pass through New Zealand\u2019s Parliament need never enter the ballot. They\u2019re part of the government\u2019s legislative agenda, advanced by senior legislators from ruling parties who already know their proposals will succeed by vote.",
      "But on one day each fortnight that Parliament sits, bills drawn from the cookie tin are debated. On Thursday, with spaces for three new bills suddenly available, Wilson presided over a ballot in Parliament\u2019s library.",
      "A small crowd of staffers and lawmakers watched as the clerk\u2019s colleagues tipped numbered bingo tokens representing each bill into the cookie tin with a flourish, shook the vessel, and drew. Spectators could find out by email which bills had won the lottery, Wilson said.",
      "\u201cI just think they quite like the performance of it,\u201d he said.",
      "All lawmakers who aren\u2019t ministers are permitted to enter one bill at a time into the ballot. It\u2019s drawn by someone who isn\u2019t affiliated to a political party including school students or visitors celebrating birthdays.",
      "So-called members\u2019 bills \u2013 and ballot or negotiation systems to select which will advance \u2013 are a feature of Westminster parliamentary democracies worldwide. But Wilson did not know of another country with such an unusual ceremony.",
      "The ritual began pragmatically, a bid to end a practice that wearied officials before. Once, lawmakers would race to the clerk\u2019s office to submit bills when a spot on the agenda became free, sometimes queuing overnight.",
      "It prompted the purchase of the cookie tin and a tradition that blends dry procedural necessity and New Zealand\u2019s cheerful cultural irreverence. Visitors to Parliament can buy mugs and socks printed with the tin\u2019s distinctive blue pattern at the gift shop.",
      "The lottery has produced some of New Zealand\u2019s most notable modern laws. Bills legalizing marriage equality and voluntary euthanasia were once drawn from the cookie tin and eventually enacted after their sponsors launched sweeping public campaigns to sway the opinions of their peers.",
      "That was the hope of two lawmakers whose measures were selected from the ballot Thursday and who said they would campaign to rally cross-party support.",
      "Arena Williams will seek a law change forcing greater transparency about the fees associated with international money transfers, which she said would especially benefit working people who send money to their families abroad. It was the second of her measures selected from the tin, improbably good luck for a lawmaker of fewer than five years.",
      "Meanwhile, a \u201cdelighted\u201d Tim van de Molen, whose law would prohibit the improper use or disposal of military decorations, was celebrating his first cookie tin victory after seven and a half years in Parliament.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a quirky part of our system that I think is typically Kiwi,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty basic sort of system, but she\u2019ll be right. It does the job.\u201d",

      "North Korea has begun steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for a failed launch of its second naval destroyer this week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Friday it began steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident that he said was caused by criminal negligence.",
      "The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged when a transport cradle on the ship's stern detached early during a launch ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, state media said. Satellite imagery on the site showed the vessel lying on its side, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Friday that the severity of the damage was \u201cnot serious\u201d and could be repaired in about 10 days. It said the hull on the starboard side was scratched and some seawater had flowed into the stern section, though it denied an earlier assessment that the bottom of the hull had been left with holes.",
      "The extremely secretive nature of North Korea makes it almost impossible to verify the assessment. North Korea has a history of manipulating or covering up military-related setbacks, policy fiascoes and other mishaps, though it has periodically acknowledged some of such events in recent years.",
      "Observers believe North Korea\u2019s admission of the failed launch was likely meant to show Kim\u2019s resolve to advance his naval capabilities and boost discipline.",
      "The North\u2019s Central Military Commission summoned Hong Kil Ho, manager of the Chongjin shipyard, as it begun its investigation of the failed launch, KCNA reported.",
      "\u201cNo matter how good the state of the warship is, the fact that the accident is an unpardonable criminal act remains unchanged, and those responsible for it can never evade their responsibility for the crime,\u201d the commission said, according to KCNA.",
      "Kim, who was present at the failed launch, had blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators and ordered that the warship be repaired before a high-level ruling Workers' Party meeting in late June.",
      "The damaged ship is assessed as the same class as North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month with great fanfare and said to be capable of carrying various weapons including nuclear missiles. Analysts say it is the North's biggest and most advanced warship to date and was likely built with Russian assistance.",
      "The North Korea-focused 38 North website had assessed last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the destroyer in Chongjin with a method it has rarely used. The report said the ship was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, while the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo used a floating dry dock.",

      "The remark was seen as utterly out of touch with the realities of ordinary people struggling to make ends meet and to afford rice to eat.

      "He acknowledged current measures aren't working and blamed \"structural problems\u201d of the government's rice policy.",
      "Experts say last summer's panic buying just worsened longstanding problems. A sharp rise in tourism and an increase in dining out have raised demand.",

      "Koizumi on Thursday announced plans to switch to voluntary government contracts for rice to better control prices and to lift a cap on the next sale.",
      "One problem may be a lack of enough milling capacity to turn the stocks of brown rice kept in reserves into the pure white rice that Japanese prefer. But others have accused some wholesalers of hoarding rice to keep prices higher.",
      "So far, the government has done little to investigate and resisted releasing reserves, fearing prices would fall, Kazuhito Yamashita, research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies.",
      "Japan could have avoided the problem by allowing more rice to be planted and exporting more if there were surpluses, he said.",
      "\u201cAcreage cutbacks are contrary to food security, a ruinous policy,\" Yamashita said. He said that the policy benefits JA by keeping small farmers afloat.",
      "Meanwhile, farmers coping with rising costs say prices aren't too high.",
      "Ultimately, Japan will need to figure out a long-term strategy since the average age of its farmers is 69, and the farming population has fallen by half over the past two decades to 1.1 million in 2024.",
      "Hiromi Akaba, who lives in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, said that she had no choice but to buy rice at the current high prices. But she added: \u201cIf this continues, we will stop eating rice. This could lead to a shift away from rice consumption.\u201d",
      "Many stores are limiting customers to one bag of rice per visit.",
      "Whatever the cause of the shortages, retailers must put rice on the shelves, so some are switching to imports, which usually aren't popular with finnicky Japanese shoppers.",
      "Major supermarket chain operator Aeon Co. plans to sell U.S. grown Japonica \u201cCalrose\u201d rice at 600 outlets in major cities beginning next month. A 4-kilogram (nearly 9-pound) bag of Calrose will sell for 2,894 yen ($20). Aeon is buying 1.4 tons to tide it over until the autumn harvest, Aeon corporate communications official Hirokazu Satou said.",
      "In the past, Aeon has sold Calrose blended with Japanese rice, and this will be the first time that it's selling bags of 100% Calrose, with suggestions like turning it into fried rice. The idea is to keep people eating rice, said Satou, who said he's worried they might just stop.",
      "\u201cWe are worried that the ongoing rice shortages and soaring prices may accelerate that trend ... and we don't want it to happen,\u201d he said.",

      "The Trump administration is doing the opposite \u2014 prioritizing fossil fuels, including boosting coal, canceling financing for clean energy and climate-friendly projects, and targeting the wind industry.",
      "In contrast to his words about Britain, Trump threatened Friday to impose a 50% tax on all imports from the EU, saying trade talks with the 27-nation bloc \u201care going nowhere.\u201d",

      "Spending on home renovations has remained resilient as elevated mortgage rates and skyrocketing home prices have frozen out many would-be buyers. That's kept U.S. home sales in a slump, limiting the market for homeowners who want to sell.",
      "Many homeowners also bought or refinanced their mortgage when the average rate on a 30-year home loan was below 3% or 4% in the first couple of years of the pandemic. That's made them reluctant to sell now, when the average rate is hovering near 7%.",

Nearly half of the owner-occupied homes in the U.S. were built before 1980 and have a median age of 41 years, according to an analysis of Census data by the National Association of Home Builders. That aging stock of homes has helped fuel the need for repairs and improvements.",

      "Rising home prices and signs of a solid economy have supported the outlook for higher spending on home improvement, but that could change if the housing market and economic outlook worsen, said Carlos Mart\u00edn, director of the JCHS\u2019 Remodeling Futures Program.",
      "\u201cBuilding materials retail sales are strong, but we are seeing a significant downturn in the sales of existing homes and their median sales price since the last projection \u2014 both are known contributors to home improvements,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBroader economic turbulence like a recession, a worsening job market or higher inflation would almost certainly temper our expectations.\u201d",

      "News that air traffic controllers directing planes into New Jersey\u2019s busiest airport twice lost both their radar and radios is alarming",
      "It was alarming news when air traffic controllers directing planes coming and going around one of the nation's busiest airports repeatedly lost their radar and radio communications, but pilots, independent air safety experts and the Federal Aviation Administration say other redundant systems kept planes from colliding.",
      "\u201cI think the risk of a collision or an incident was increased, but not significantly because of the redundancy in the aviation system,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Crashes like January's deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter usually have different causes \u2014 a combination of many things that go wrong, he says.",
      "Here's a look at what happened in Newark \u2014 and how key pieces of the safety net protected planeloads of people.",
      "The radar and communications systems that a terminal control team in Philadelphia relies on to direct planes in and out of Newark International Airport simultaneously failed twice in the past month for brief periods. The main line that carries the radar signal from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn\u2019t work immediately. The system relies in part on aging copper wires and even when there are fiber optic lines, the signal has to be slowed down when it reaches the facility because the FAA computers are so old they can't handle all the data at full speed.",
      "As a result, the controllers were suddenly unable to see or communicate with planes coming from or going to Newark for as long as 90 seconds on April 28 and May 9. Their radar screens showing each flights in motion suddenly went black. Their radio connections went silent.",
      "The main line failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online. The FAA said a fourth outage Monday knocked out radio communications for two seconds, but the radar stayed online.",
      "After the initial outage, the already shorthanded control center in Philadelphia lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. Newark's terminal control team could no longer manage a full schedule of handoffs with the airport's control tower, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays that rippled across the nation's airlines. The FAA then imposed safety limits, allowing no more than 28 arrivals and 28 departures every hour. Before, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly.",
      "When air traffic controllers lose the ability to see or speak to airborne planes, they can try text messaging the pilots via data link systems or try high-powered portable radios. An emergency radio frequency might also be an alternative if main communications are down. Tower controllers have high-powered light guns to send a green or red signal to pilots to let them know if they are clear to land even if they can't talk to them over the radio.",
      "And the entire air traffic control system is built on an overlapping network of radar sites. So if a terminal control team like the one in Philadelphia loses its communications, a controller in a radar center that normally directs planes at higher altitudes might step in. If some other controller in the area hears a pilot broadcasting on an emergency frequency, they too can relay a message.",
      "During these Philadelphia outages, voice communications came back online first while the radar took another minute to reboot, and controllers were able to hand off planes without having to resort to some of those other options.",
      "In a May 9 recording captured by www.liveATC.net, a controller can be heard saying \u201cFedEx 1989. I'm going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again. If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\u201d The pilot acknowledged that and wished the controllers \u201cgood luck guys\u201d before switching frequencies.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau has tried to reassure the public that all these backups and limits on the number of flights keep flying safe, despite these problems that have exposed how fragile and outdated some air traffic control systems have become.",
      "\u201cWhen disruptions occur at any airport because of equipment issues or staffing, the FAA will always ensure safety by slowing down airport arrivals and departures and reducing congestion,\u201d Rocheleau posted on X. \u201cWe keep the flying public safe because there are redundancies built throughout the entire system used by pilots, technicians and air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Every pilot is trained on what to do if they can't talk to the air traffic controllers, and modern passenger jets have their own backup systems. Airline pilots all regularly get refresher training emphasizing safety.",
      "Capt. Miles Morgan oversees all training for 17,000 United Airlines pilots at a facility in Denver filled with simulators and classrooms. He said losing communications is rare, but it's something pilots prepare for, as most training focuses on what to do if something goes wrong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for 30 years. I\u2019ve got almost 18,000 hours in United airplanes -- jets, and I\u2019ve lost communication one time,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt really ended up not being that big of a deal. I just went to the emergency frequency, got a different channel, and contacted a different facility to get back into communication.\u201d",
      "In addition to multiple communications systems, planes are equipped with collision avoidance technology that shows pilots where all the other planes are moving around them. These systems alert pilots to an approaching aircraft's trajectory and can recommend evasive action to prevent a collision if planes get too close, Morgan said.",
      "Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said that when pilots lose contact with controllers, their first action is to continue on their last-directed path. If the outage continues, they'll broadcast their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower \u2014 as they follow their flight plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to downplay the seriousness of communication failure or radar outages, but it\u2019s to recognize that we have procedures, we trained to those procedures, and we have additional equipment that can only enhance the safety margin while we deal with that scenario,\u201d Tajer said.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Louisiana environmental groups is suing the state over a law they say violates their free speech rights by restricting them from sharing information about air quality",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- On days of heavy pollution in Sulphur, a southwest Louisiana town surrounded by more than 16 industrial plants, Cynthia \u201cCindy\u201d Robertson once flew a red flag outside her home so her community knew they faced health hazards from high levels of soot and other pollutants.",
      "But she stopped flying the flag after Louisiana passed a law last May that threatened fines of up to $1 million for sharing information about air quality that did not meet strict standards.",
      "On Thursday, Robertson's group Micah 6:8 Mission and other Louisiana environmental organizations sued the state in federal court over the law they say restricts their free speech and undermines their ability to promote public health in heavily industrialized communities.",
      "When neighbors asked where the flags went, \"I\u2019d tell them, \u2019The state of Louisiana says we can\u2019t tell y\u2019all that stuff,' \u201d Robertson said.",
      "While the state has argued the law ensures that accurate data is shared with the public, environmental groups like Micah 6:8 Mission believed it was intended to censor them with \u201conerous restrictions\u201d and violates their free speech rights, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur's pollution using high quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group's social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.",
      "While federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, fence-line communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.",
      "The Biden administration's EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the \u201cfence-line\u201d with industrial plants that emitted pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups say they lack confidence in the data the state does provide and embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.",
      "\u201cThese programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,\u201d the lawsuit stated.",
      "In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana's Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants \u201cfor the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance\u201d of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cYou can't talk about air quality unless you're using the equipment that they want you to use,\u201d said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide \u201cperfectly adequate results ... to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they're breathing is safe.\u201d",
      "Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a small nonprofit, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay one day's worth of that,\u201d Robertson said. \"And the way the law is written, it\u2019s so ambiguous, you don\u2019t really know what you can and can\u2019t do.\"",
      "There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,\u201d said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs \u2018violates their constitutional rights\u2019,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.",
      "Industry groups are excluded from the law's requirements, the lawsuit notes.",
      "The law presumes \u201cthat air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment, citing pending litigation.",

    "story": [
      "Brazil-based meat giant JBS hopes an upcoming shareholder vote will put it one step closer to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange",
      "Making meat is a messy business. But for Brazilian meat giant JBS, getting approval to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange has been even messier.",
      "Environmentalists, animal rights groups, U.S. lawmakers and even some of its own investors have tried to stop a U.S. listing for JBS, noting the company\u2019s long record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "But JBS has persevered, saying dual listings in Sao Paulo and New York would attract new investors and better reflect its global portfolio. Late last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted the company\u2019s request to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "JBS is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies, with more than 250 production facilities in 17 countries. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. It\u2019s America\u2019s top beef producer and it\u2019s second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "On Friday, JBS\u2019 minority shareholders \u2013 who hold 30% of its shares \u2013 are scheduled to vote on the dual-listing plan. If they approve it, the company could list its shares in New York as early as next month.",
      "Early vote totals, which JBS released Thursday in a filing in Brazil, showed that 52% of shareholders opposed the plan. But there were many more votes to be counted, so the outcome was far from clear.",
      "Last fall, 20 environmental organizations \u2014 including Mighty Earth, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network \u2014 signed an open letter to JBS investors opposing the listing, saying it would put the climate at greater risk.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that shareholders reject the plan.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "\u201cIn our view, the involvement of the company and of Joesley and Wesley Batista in multiple high-profile scandals has tarnished the company\u2019s reputation, undermining stakeholder trust and posing a significant risk to its competitive position,\u201d Glass Lewis said.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which would give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "In its response to Glass Lewis' report, JBS said it has established more stringent controls and anti-corruption training at the company in recent years. It also said a U.S. listing would ensure more oversight from U.S. authorities.",
      "\u201cWe believe this transaction will increase our visibility in global markets, attract new investors and further strengthen our position as a global food industry leader,\u201d JBS Global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said in a statement last month when the company announced Friday\u2019s vote.",
      "But many U.S. lawmakers also aren't convinced JBS belongs on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "In a letter sent last week to JBS, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, noted that Pilgrim\u2019s Pride \u2014 a U.S. company owned by JBS \u2014 was the largest single donor to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, with a $5 million gift. The SEC\u2019s approval came just weeks after that donation, Warren said.",
      "\u201cI am concerned Pilgrim\u2019s Pride may have made its contribution to the inaugural fund to curry favor with the Trump administration,\u201d Warren wrote in the letter, which asked the company why the donation was made.",
      "In a statement, JBS said it has a \u201clong bipartisan history of participating in the civic process.\u201d",
      "Warren was also among a bipartisan group of 15 U.S. senators who sent a letter to the SEC in January 2024 urging the agency to reject a U.S. listing for JBS. The senators, a diverse group that rarely agrees on policy, included Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "The letter noted that in 2020, J&F Investments, a controlling shareholder of JBS that is owned by the Batista family, pleaded guilty to bribery charges in U.S. federal court and agreed to pay fines of $256 million.",
      "It also said Pilgrim\u2019s Pride pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges in 2021. And it said U.S. Senate investigations found that JBS is \u201cturning a blind eye\u201d to rainforest destruction in the Amazon by its suppliers.",
      "\u201cApproval of JBS\u2019 proposed listing would subject U.S. investors to risk from a company with a history of blatant, systemic corruption, and further entrench its monopoly power and embolden its monopoly practices,\u201d the letter said.",

      "Argentina\u2019s government has unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's government on Thursday unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country, as libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to boost Argentina's low international currency reserves and stimulate the limping economy.",
      "By eliminating tax reporting requirements, the plan invites savers \u2014 who long have swapped their depreciating pesos for American currency in the country's underground market \u2014 to spend unreported dollars on everyday transactions at home. The government won\u2019t ask questions regarding the source of the repatriated funds, officials promised.",
      "\u201cYour dollars, your decision. What\u2019s yours is yours, not the state\u2019s,\u201d Milei\u2019s presidential spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said in a press conference announcing the policies. \u201cYou can use them however you want, without having to prove where you got them from.\u201d",
      "Milei \u2014 who ran on a controversial campaign pledge to \u201cdollarize\u201d Argentina's troubled economy \u2014 wants a new gush of greenbacks to boost the volume of U.S. dollars in circulation.",
      "Although Argentina's depleted currency reserves sent Milei backpedaling from his initial campaign trail-fervor for \u201cburning down\u201d the central bank and adopting the U.S. dollar as the national currency, these latest measures seek to hasten the country\u2019s transition to a new currency system that would see dollars gradually replacing pesos.",
      "Milei's \u201cendogenous dollarization\u201d scheme would involve fixing the supply of the local currency even as Argentines could use dollars or pesos. He hopes this would encourage Argentines to use their dollar-denominated savings to buy houses and cars as the economy grows and more cash is needed in circulation.",
      "To lay the groundwork, Milei\u2019s government last year imposed a generous tax amnesty for Argentines willing to repatriate capital. In April, it lifted most currency controls as part of a $20 billion bail-out deal with the International Monetary Fund, which conditions its support on the government boosting its scarce foreign reserves.",
      "\u201cYou can spend those dollars without anyone bothering you. So, you go, you want to buy, I don\u2019t know, a house for $200,000, no one has to ask you anything,\u201d Milei told the TV channel of Argentine newspaper La Nacion in an interview Monday.",
      "Over decades of financial turmoil, Argentines have come to depend on U.S. dollars to evade a byzantine system of currency controls, hedge against hyperinflation and protect their nest eggs from government freezes, as has happened several times in the country's recent history, such as during the catastrophic 2001 foreign-debt default.",
      "\u201cThis is how we reached a catastrophic outcome in which 50% of our economy ended up being informal, and the state, like Big Brother, controlled all of its citizens\u2019 transactions, as if they were criminals deserving of punishment,\u201d Adorni said.",
      "Argentina\u2019s official statistics agency estimates that, as of late 2024, Argentine households and firms held more than $270 billion outside their financial system, largely denominated in U.S. currency. While most of the billions are in foreign bank accounts, a significant amount of cash is also stuffed under mattresses and floorboards and in rented safety deposit boxes in underground vaults across the country.",
      "\u201cThose who do this are not criminals,\u201d Economy Minister Luis Caputo said Thursday. \u201cThey are the vast majority of Argentines who have been abused by excessive taxes and controls.",
      "To encourage Argentines to spend their repatriated funds, the new measures scrap strict requirements for businesses and credit card providers to report citizens' purchases to ARCA, Argentina's equivalent of the IRS. They relax strict tax evasion rules so property buyers and public notaries won't need to report transactions. Banks won't be able to request access to clients' tax records.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like an invitation not to pay taxes,\u201d said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at advisory firm Medley Global Advisors.",
      "That raises concerns about an injection of potentially dirty funds, some of which could be the product of illegal activity. Asked about the danger created by the new fiscal incentives, the IMF sounded a cautious note.",
      "\u201cThe authorities have committed to strengthening financial transparency,\u201d said Julie Kozack, an IMF spokesperson. \u201cAny new measures, including those that may be aimed at encouraging the use of undeclared assets, should be, of course, consistent with these important commitments.\u201d",

      "Researchers are beginning to wonder if blockbuster drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound could play a role in preventing cancer",
      "Excess body weight can raise the risk of certain cancers, leading researchers to wonder whether blockbuster drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound could play a role in cancer prevention.",
      "Now, a study of 170,000 patient records suggests there's a slightly lower risk of obesity-related cancers in U.S. adults with diabetes who took these popular medications compared to those who took another class of diabetes drug not associated with weight loss.",
      "This type of study can't prove cause and effect, but the findings hint at a connection worth exploring. More than a dozen cancers are associated with obesity.",
      "\u201cThis is a call to scientists and clinical investigators to do more work in this area to really prove or disprove this,\u201d said Dr. Ernest Hawk of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The findings were released Thursday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and will be discussed at its annual meeting in Chicago. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was led by Lucas Mavromatis, a medical student at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cChronic disease and chronic disease prevention are some of my passions,\u201d said Mavromatis, a former research fellow with an NIH training program.",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists are injections used to treat diabetes, and some are also approved to treat obesity. They work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They don't work for everyone and can produce side effects that include nausea and stomach pain.",
      "In the study, researchers analyzed data from 43 U.S. health systems to compare two groups: people with obesity and diabetes who took GLP-1 drugs and other people with the same conditions who took diabetes drugs like sitagliptin. The two groups were equal in size and matched for other characteristics.",
      "After four years, those who took GLP-1 drugs had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause compared to those who took the other type of diabetes drug. There were 2,501 new cases of obesity-related cancer in the GLP-1 group compared to 2,671 cases in the other group.",
      "The effect was evident in women, but not statistically significant in men. The study couldn't explain that difference, but Mavromatis noted that differences in blood drug concentration, weight loss, metabolism or hormones could be at play.",

      "The budget reconciliation bill passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.",
      "A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.",
      "The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden\u2019s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.",
      "\u201cIn a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "\u201cThese credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.",
      "President Donald Trump celebrated the bill\u2019s passage, calling it \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.\u201d Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.",
      "The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.",
      "Full-scale repeal of current credits \"could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.",
      "\"A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,\u201d the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.",
      "In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.",
      "The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.",
      "Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.",
      "House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China \u2014 an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.",
      "The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don\u2019t start construction within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.",
      "\u201cThis bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it\u2019s proving to be not only economically beneficial \u2014 lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies \u2014 but also essential to America\u2019s energy future,\" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.",
      "At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.",
      "The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.",
      "\u201cOnce the land is sold, we will never get it back,\u201d Zinke said after the provision\u2019s removal. \u201dPublic access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism \u2014 our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.\u201d",
      "The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.",
      "Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was \u201cexploring all options\u201d to make the transfers happen.",
      "Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.",
      "Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke\u2019s work to prevent the public lands sale.",
      "But she added that the bill was still a \u201cbig giveaway\u201d to the private sector. \u201cBy opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.",
      "Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.",

Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "\u2014 A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in late December in South Korea after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries.",

      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries.

The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident. It was a Black Hawk priority air transport from the same unit known as the PAT25 that collided with the passenger jet in midair in January.",
      "\u2014 In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate ticked up to 6.01% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.24% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",

      "A new government-issued report reflects some of the most controversial views on vaccines, the nation\u2019s food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- A government report released on Thursday covering wide swaths of American health and wellness reflects some of the most contentious views on vaccines, the nation's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The much-anticipated \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report calls for increased scrutiny of the childhood vaccine schedule, a review of the pesticides sprayed on American crops and a description of the nation's children as overmedicated and undernourished.",
      "\u201cNever in American history has the federal government taken a position on public health like this,\u201d Kennedy told a group of MAHA supporters during an event unveiling the report on Thursday.",
      "While it does not have the force of a law or official policy, the 69-page report will be used over the next three months for the MAHA commission to fashion a plan that can be implemented during the remainder of President Donald Trump's term.",
      "Speaking to MAHA supporters at the White House on Thursday, Trump praised the report.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong and we will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic in America,\u201d",
      "Kennedy refused to provide details about who authored the report.",
      "Increased scrutiny of childhood vaccines \u2014 credited with saving millions of people from deadly diseases \u2014 figures prominently in the report. It poses questions over the necessity of school mandates that require children to get vaccinated for admittance and suggestions that vaccines should undergo more clinical trials, including with placebos.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has raised doubts about the safety of shots even as a measles outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 Americans. This week, Kennedy\u2019s health department moved to limit U.S. access to COVID-19 shots.",
      "The report does not provide any evidence that the childhood vaccine schedule, which includes shots for measles, polio and the chickenpox, is to blame for rising obesity, diabetes or autism rates, said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not as if they\u2019re positing any kind of causal link,\u201d Adalja said, adding that Kennedy is \u201cis trying to devalue vaccines in the minds of Americans.\u201d",
      "Parts of the report highlight growing factions within the Trump administration's MAHA movement, even as the report strained to appease opposing forces within the politically diverse coalition that Trump and Kennedy have fostered.",
      "The report makes dozens of references to dietary guidelines and standards in Europe, but Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin promised it would not yield more rigorous regulations.",
      "\u201cThis cannot happen through a European mandate system that stifles growth,\u201d Zeldin said in a call with reporters.",
      "Despite numerous studies and statements throughout the MAHA report that raise concerns about American food products, Trump Cabinet officials insisted during a call with reporters on Thursday that the nation's food supply is safe.",
      "The report mentions that glyphosate, a commonly used chemical sprayed on crops, may cause serious health problems, including cancer. The World Health Organization has said that the chemical is a probable carcinogen to humans, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is unlikely.",
      "Farmers, who \u2014 alongside Republican lawmakers \u2014 hounded the Trump administration leading up to the report's release, swiftly criticized the report's comments on the chemicals.",
      "\u201cThe Make America Healthy Again Report is filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides,\u201d the National Corn Growers Association said in a statement.",
      "But Kennedy's MAHA supporters were also disappointed, saying the report didn't go far enough when it came to chemicals used on crops.",
      "\u201cIf the Trump White House and Republicans don't take pesticides and glyphosate's link to human health issues seriously, it will cost them the MAHA vote in the midterms,\u201d said Dave Murphy, a former Kennedy fundraiser who spearheaded a push for the issue to be addressed in the report.",
      "Talking about the report on Thursday, Trump reiterated his \u201clove\u201d for farmers.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins acknowledged the tight rope Trump officials are walking to keep farmers, many of them in Republican-leaning states, happy while also working to satisfy Kennedy's eclectic and health-conscious following.",
      "\u201cDo all of us agree on everything? Of course not,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cBut the place that we have landed, which is, I think all of us agree, is that this is not a binary choice between an industry, agriculture and health.\u201d",
      "The report comes out stronger, however, against ultraprocessed foods \u2014 industrially made products high in refined grains, sugar, saturated fats and additives like artificial dyes that now make up two-thirds of the diet for U.S. teens and children. Such products have been linked to a host of poor health outcomes, though documenting how they cause those problems has been notoriously difficult and time-consuming.",
      "The MAHA commission report \u201cis a pretty accurate depiction of the nutrition crisis facing our country,\u201d said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, an expert in nutrition and policy at Tufts University.",
      "The report focuses not only on ultraprocessed foods, but also on how too few fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and fish are present in U.S. diets, he noted. But the report leaves out excess salt, which causes harm, even in young children.",
      "The MAHA report calls on the National Institutes of Health to execute sweeping, nationwide studies of ultraprocessed foods, even as the White House has called for $18 billion to be axed from the agency's budget. An extra $500 million has been requested from Congress for Kennedy's MAHA initiative.",
      "The report raises concerns about other environmental and chemical research results, funded by corporations and industry, being skewed.",
      "But the MAHA commission's call for more neutral research comes as sweeping budget and staff cuts propelled by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have resulted in 20,000 jobs lost at the nation\u2019s health department and billions of dollars rescinded for research studies. The Trump administration also gutted the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program in its cuts of health-tracking programs.",
      "The report also raises concerns about the lack of physical activity among children and their prescription drug use, including antibiotics and medications used to treat attention deficit disorders.",
      "Some in the MAHA movement have raised concerns about offering medications, even over-the-counter drugs like pain relievers, to children.",
      "But Trump spent 10 minutes during Thursday's event telling MAHA supporters how he's working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The East Room crowd, packed full of MAHA supporters that offered applause for Trump's calls to investigate chronic disease in children, responded mildly \u2014 and eventually stopped clapping entirely \u2014 as he continued to talk about lowering drug costs.",
      "\u201cI think it's going to go down as one of the most important things we've ever down because drug prices are going to go down,\u201d he said, as Kennedy looked on.",

      "ATLANTA -- Mercedes-Benz announced Thursday that it plans establish its North American headquarters in metro Atlanta, where the automaker will expand its existing U.S. corporate hub by adding hundreds of jobs relocated from other cities.",
      "The change will add about 500 jobs to the Georgia facility that has served as Mercedes-Benz\u2019s U.S. headquarters since 2018. It employs about 800 people currently. The German automaker said in a news release that it also plans to add a new, multimillion-dollar research and development center nearby.",
      "Most of the additional jobs coming to Sandy Springs north of Atlanta are being moved from the Detroit area, where Mercedes-Benz is closing its financial services headquarters.",
      "Mercedes-Benz said in a news release that the headquarters expansion in Georgia should be completed by August 2026.",
      "\"Bringing our teams closer together will enable us to be more agile, increase speed to market, and ensure the best customer experience,\u201d Jason Hoff, CEO of Mercedes-Benz North America, said in a statement.",
      "The headquarters expansion bolsters Georgia's reputation for luring automotive jobs. Porsche also has its North American headquarters outside Atlanta, while Hyundai and Kia both have large manufacturing plants in the state. Electric SUV maker Rivian is also building a Georgia factory.",
      "\u201cGeorgia continues to lead the way in the future of mobility and technical innovation, attracting world-class companies like Mercedes-Benz that are driving the automotive industry forward,\u201d Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has voted to block California\u2019s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted on Thursday to block California\u2019s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.",
      "The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.",
      "\u201cThis is not about electric vehicles,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. \u201cThis is about polluters being able to pollute more.\u201d",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.",
      "The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California\u2019s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends \u2014 especially because about a dozen states have already followed California's lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.",
      "Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should \u201csend a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.\"",
      "\u201cWhat we have at stake is a state\u2019s ability, it\u2019s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,\u201d Schiff said.",
      "Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation\u2019s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.",
      "\u201cAmerica cannot meet these impossible standards \u2013- not next year, and not in 10 years,\u201d said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.",
      "Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "The Biden administration approved the state\u2019s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "Biden\u2019s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.",
      "Republicans have long criticized California's waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California\u2019s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.",
      "Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.",
      "Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California\u2019s laws were a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d and called the Republicans \u201cfair weather institutionalists.\u201d",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a \u201cspecial responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.\u201d",
      "John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cThe fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,\" Bozzella said.",

      "European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief says that membership candidate Serbia faces a \u201cstrategic choice\u201d of direction",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official said Thursday that membership candidate Serbia faces a \u201cstrategic choice\u201d of direction, just weeks after Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic defied EU warnings and attended Russia\u2019s Victory Day parade in Moscow.",
      "\u201cSerbia faces a strategic, geostrategic choice, where it wants to be,\" Kaja Kallas said during her visit to Belgrade. \u201cSerbia\u2019s European future depends on the values it chooses to uphold.\u201d",
      "Vucic's appearance in Moscow for the May 9 parade was widely condemned in Brussels, with EU officials warning that such actions seriously jeopardize Serbia\u2019s EU path. The officials said that it was inappropriate for Vucic to stand side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin, considering Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kallas said that she discussed the visit with Vucic.",
      "\u201cAnd I expressed my views, which are very clear,\" she said.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why it is necessary to stand side by side with the person who is conducting this horrible war in Ukraine,\" she said. \"And President Vucic was explaining his side of the story. So, yes, we had a very extensive discussion about this.\u201d",
      "Vucic, a former extreme nationalist criticized at home and abroad over alleged increasingly authoritarian ways, has maintained close relations with both Russia and China, while formally saying that he wants Serbia to join the EU.",
      "Vucic has said his decision to attend Putin\u2019s military parade, which marked the World War II victory over Nazi Germany, was part of efforts to maintain \u201ctraditional friendships\u201d \u2014 Russia is a fellow Slavic and Orthodox Christian nation \u2014 while seeking EU entry.",
      "Serbia, which relies almost fully on Russia for energy, has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and hasn\u2019t supported most EU statements condemning the aggression.",
      "Vucic also has been under pressure at home following six months of large anti-corruption protests that erupted after a train station tragedy in Serbia\u2019s north that killed 16 people and which many in the country blamed on state officials' graft during infrastructure construction.",
      "\u201cFrom my discussions with the Serbian political leadership, it is clear that EU membership remains a strategic goal,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cHowever, I want to emphasize that we need to see actions also to prove and support those words.\u201d",
      "\u201cReforms are how Serbia will advance along its EU path,\" Kallas added. \"There are no shortcuts for membership. Real progress must be made here in Belgrade.\u201d",
      "She said she also met the protesting \u201cyouth,\u201d referring to the students who have led months of demonstrations, and called for Serbia to make serious efforts on media freedom, combating corruption and electoral reform.",
      "\u201cThese reforms will bring real benefits for the citizens and the people of Serbia as hundreds of thousands of protesters have been demanding in recent weeks. The autonomy of the universities must be respected,\u201d she said.",
      "From Belgrade, Kallas traveled to the former Serbian province of Kosovo which unitarily declared independence in 2008, a move that Serbia doesn't recognize.",
      "EU-mediated talks between the two neighboring states have been long been frozen. Kallas said normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo is \u201cfundamental\u201d for their European future.",
      "\u201cIt is time the two countries to overcome the past a focus on the common future,\u201d she said. \u201cI plan to invite the representatives from Belgrade and Pristina to Brussels as soon as possible to discuss the concrete steps forward.\u201d",
      "In Kosovo, where Kallas will meet with Prime Minister Albin Kurti, political representatives and civil society groups, she said that the normalization of Kosovo-Serbia relations \u201cis the only path to a safer and more prosperous future for the people of this region.\u201d",
      "\u201cStability depends on dialogue, not confrontation,\u201d she said at a news conference.",
      "Kallas said that Brussels \u201chas begun to gradually lift measures introduced in June 2023,\u201d adding that a full lifting is \u201cconditional on sustained de-escalation in the north.\u201d",
      "Most of the ethnic Serb minority population lives in four municipalities in northern Kosovo, which has seen tensions rise in the last three years.",
      "Normalization talks between Kosovo and Serbia began in 2011, but have failed to make any progress.",
      "The Kosovo war in 1998-1999 left around 11,400 people dead. A 78-day NATO air campaign ended the fighting and pushed Serbian forces out of Kosovo.",
      "The six Western Balkan countries are in different phases of accession. Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 encouraged Europe\u2019s leaders to push for the countries to join the bloc, fearing instability.",

      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in April, as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.",
      "Existing home sales dropped 0.5% last month, from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The sales decline marks the slowest sales pace for the month of April going back to 2009 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis. March\u2019s sales pace was also the slowest for that month going back to 2009.",
      "Sales fell 2% compared with April last year. The latest home sales fell slightly short of the 4.10 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.",
      "Home prices increased on an annual basis for the 22nd consecutive month, although at the slowest rate since July 2023. The national median sales price rose 1.8% in April from a year earlier to $414,000, an all-time high for the month of April.",
      "\u201cThe affordability condition is clearly hurting the market, particularly higher mortgage rates,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.",
      "For the past three years, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes have been at about 75% of what they were before the pandemic. The market slump began in early 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Homes sales fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The average rate\u2019s low point so far was five weeks ago, when it briefly dropped to 6.62%. This week, it averaged 6.86%, its highest level since mid-February.",
      "Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in March and April, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.62% to 6.83%.",
      "High mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have frozen out many would-be homebuyers struggling to find a home they can afford.",
      "Homeownership is out of reach for many Americans after years of surging home prices. The median U.S. home sales price has jumped 53% over the past six years.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates are benefiting from more homes on the market when compared with recent years.",
      "There were 1.45 million unsold homes at the end of last month, a 9% increase from March, and 20.8% higher than April last year, NAR said. That's the most homes on the market since September 2020, but it's still well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic.",
      "The latest unsold inventory snapshot translates to a 4.4-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 3.5-month pace at the end of April last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.",
      "One reason the inventory of homes for sale has been rising is that properties are taking longer to sell. Homes typically remained on the market for 29 days last month before selling, up from 26 days in April last year, NAR said.",
      "The wider selection of homes on the market likely helped boost sales among first-time homebuyers. They accounted for 34% of sales last month, the highest level since July 2020, but that is still down from the historical norm of 40%.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to sidestep mortgage rates and pay all cash for a home accounted for 25% of sales last month, down from 28% a year earlier. Investors, who account for many all-cash purchases, made up 15% of homes sold last month, down from 16% a year earlier, NAR said.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for a shot.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That raises big implications for next fall's vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "FDA's independent advisers may raise those issues Thursday, but the changes are not the focus of the meeting, which was scheduled before FDA\u2019s announcement.",
      "Instead, the panel is set to recommend whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax.",
      "\u201cWe are asking for guidance to help the FDA decide what strain to select for COVID-19 vaccines going forward,\u201d FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad said in comments opening the meeting. Prasad added that the agency wants \u201cto give people a little more time to digest,\u201d the new policy on vaccines and is open to feedback.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "That JN.1 family still dominates, although it continues to evolve. The question is whether last fall\u2019s shots still offer enough cross-protection or if manufacturers instead should match today\u2019s most common subtype, called LP.8.1.",
      "The World Health Organization recently said last year's version was OK but that vaccine makers could choose an update. The European Medicines Agency instead recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "FDA officials didn\u2019t express a preference in documents posted online ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. suggested earlier in the week that the government should move away from yearly updates.",
      "\u201cInstead of having a COVID-19 strategy that\u2019s year-to-year where we change things every single year, why don\u2019t we let the science tell us when to change?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Debating that science is what the FDA's vaccine advisers do each year. If they recommend leaving the shots unchanged \u2014 and the FDA agrees \u2014 it's possible that healthy adults and children may still get access to a fall booster, since this week's policy changes suggest new studies would be required only if manufacturers switch strains or introduce a completely new vaccine. Those would be large, six-month studies, and vaccine experts question if their cost and logistics could make them unfeasible.",
      "Still, the FDA's strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "Prasad and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary were both outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, particularly the recommendation for use in young, healthy adults and children. Before joining government, they each garnered attention from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who built a national following by casting doubt on the safety and benefits of vaccines.",
      "In a medical journal editorial outlining the FDA\u2019s new approach, they criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, saying it has long been out of step with Europe and other places with more limited recommendations for boosters.",

      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are seen as representative of U.S. layoffs and have mostly bounced around a historically healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 ravaged the economy and wiped out millions of jobs five years ago.",
      "Even though President Donald Trump has paused or dialed down many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "The U.S. and China last week agreed to a 90-day pause in their trade war, giving financial markets a boost and at least temporarily relieving some of the anxiety over the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy.",

      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and the government recently reported that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025. Growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the U.S. tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Trump has also promised to drastically downsize the federal government workforce, but many of those cuts are being challenged in the courts and Congress.",

      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%.",
      "Many economists still anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",

      "Amber Salazar is the kind of idealist you just knew would end up running a store like Banned Wagon Books",
      "NEW YORK -- Amber Salazar is the kind of idealist you just knew would end up running a bookstore \u2014 a lifelong reader who felt angered \u201cto the core\u201d as she learned of book bans around the country.",
      "A resident of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Salazar last year opened Banned Wagon Books, a pop-up store she sets up everywhere from wineries to coffee shops, featuring such frequently censored works as Maia Kobabe's \u201cGender Queer,\u201d Angie Thomas' \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d and Toni Morrison's \u201cBeloved.\u201d",
      "\u201cI decided that no matter what it looked like, I was going to open a bookstore so that I could contribute in some small way and stand up for intellectual freedom in the U.S.,\u201d explains Salazar, 33, who donates 5% of her profits to the American Library Association and other organizations opposing bans. \u201cSince we were coming out of the pandemic at that time, I started thinking about ways to combine my love of literature and passion for intellectual freedom with my appreciation for the small businesses in my city who weathered some difficult storms through shutdowns and supply chain concerns.\u201d",
      "Salazar is among a wave of new \u2014 and, often, younger \u2014 owners who have helped the independent book community dramatically expand, intensify and diversify. Independent bookselling is not a field for fortune seekers: Most local stores, whether run by retirees, bookworms or those switching careers in middle age, have some sense of higher purpose. But for many who opened in recent years, it's an especially critical mission. Narrative in Somerville, Massachusetts, identifies as \u201cproudly immigrant-woman owned & operated, with an emphasis on amplifying marginalized voices & experiences.\u201d In Chicago, Call & Response places \u201cthe voices of Black and other authors of color at the center of our work.\u201d",
      "Independent stores will likely never recover their power of 50 years ago, before the rise of Barnes & Noble superstores and the online giant Amazon.com. But the days of industry predictions of their demise seem well behind. In 2016, there were 1,244 members in the American Booksellers Association trade group, at 1,749 locations. As of this month, the ABA has 2,863 individual members, at 3,281 locations. And more than 200 stores are in the process of opening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, this kind of energy,\u201d says association CEO Allison Hill, remembering how, during the pandemic, she feared that the ABA could lose up to a quarter of its membership. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us would have predicted this a few years ago.\u201d",
      "Hill and others acknowledge that even during an era of growth, booksellers remain vulnerable to political and economic challenges. Costs of supplies remain high and could grow higher because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. ABA President Cynthia Compton, who runs two stores in the Indianapolis area, says that sales to schools are down because censorship laws have made educators more cautious about what they purchase.",
      "The ABA\u2019s own website advises: \u201cPassion and knowledge have to be combined with business acumen if your bookstore is to succeed.\u201d",
      "Salazar herself is part of an Instagram chat group, Bookstores Helping Bookstores, with such like-minded sellers as the owners of The Crafty Bookstore in Bloomington, Indiana, \u201cspecializing in Indie books & custom bookish accessories,\u201d and the Florida-based Chapter Bound, an online store with a calling \u201cto connect great books with great people \u2014 at prices everyone can afford.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the age of social media, people are craving genuine connection and community,\u201d Salazar says. \u201cAnd books often provide a catalyst to that feeling of community.\u201d",
      "Stephen Sparks, who is 47 and since 2017 has owned Point Reyes Books northwest of San Francisco, believes that the pandemic gave sellers of all ages a heightened sense of their role in the community and that the return of Trump to the White House added new urgency. Sales are up 20% this year, he says, if only because \u201cduring tough times, people come to bookstores.\u201d",
      "The younger owners bring with them a wide range of prior experience. Salazar had worked in retail management for nine years, switched to property and casualty insurance sales \u201cin search of advancement opportunity\u201d and, right before she launched her store, was a business process owner, \u201ca blend of project management, customer and employee experience management.\u201d",
      "Courtney Bledsoe, owner of Call & Response, had been a corporate attorney before undertaking a \u201cfull career shift\u201d and risking a substantial drop in income. The 30-year-old held no illusions that owning a store meant \u201cpouring a cup of coffee and reading all day.\u201d Calling herself \u201crisk averse,\u201d she researched the book retail business as if preparing for a trial, before committing herself and launching Call & Response in May 2024.",
      "\u201cThis endeavor is probably the hardest thing I have ever done in my life,\u201d she says, acknowledging it could take a couple of years before she can even pay herself a salary. \u201cWe're just doing this to serve the community, doing something we love to do, providing people with great events, great reading. It's been a real joy.\u201d",

      "Pato O'Ward hopes spending the morning milking a cow will help him finally clear out the negative karma keeping him from winning the Indianapolis 500",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Pato O'Ward learned this week that it behooves Indianapolis 500 drivers to take part in the rookie tradition of milking a cow if they ever want to drink the stuff in victory lane upon winning \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d",
      "Problem is that O'Ward never got that opportunity \u2014 until Friday.",
      "One day after lamenting that his Indy 500 debut occurred amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indiana Dairy Association and his Arrow McLaren team came through for him. The folks at Silverstone Farms in nearby Greenfield, Indiana, loaded up a cow named Rihanna and trucked her to the track on Friday, where she was waiting for O'Ward at the crack of dawn.",
      "O'Ward, one of the most charismatic and popular drivers in the paddock, was udderly amazed.",
      "\u201cWoke up for some morning milking, and it was a really cool experience,\u201d he said, flashing a big smile. \u201cVery warm. You know, gotta warm her up. Yeah, she was fabulous. Did you see a video at least? You'll see. First try.\u201d",
      "Yep, first tug and there came the stream of milk.",
      "Perhaps that's a good omen as O'Ward chases his first Indy 500 win. He has finished second twice in the most important race of the season, and has talked candidly about how Indianapolis Motor Speedway has repeatedly broken his heart.",
      "Maybe the fact that he hadn't milked the cow was the karma keeping him from victory lane.",
      "The high-steaks effort to get a cow to the speedway before Sunday's race came after O'Ward sat for a press conference Thursday with Robert Shwartzman, who earned the pole as an Indy 500 rookie. Shwarzman dutifully took part in the traditional milking earlier in the week, and as he explained: \"The woman, she came to me and said, \u2018The people who didn\u2019t milk the cow, they never won the Indy 500,\u2019 and they were like (did not finish). It\u2019s bad luck.\u201d",
      "Shwartzman pointed out that Alexander Rossi milked the cow when he won as a rookie in 2016.",
      "\u201cYou have to milk the cow,\u201d Shwartzman said, describing his personal experience with a \u201cvery calm, cute\u201d cow named Indy.",
      "To which O'Ward declared: \u201cI\u2019m going find a cow, and I\u2019m going to milk it tonight.\"",
      "\u201cWe know some farmers who know some cows who can make that happen,\u201d the Indiana Dairy Association responded on X.",
      "It only took them a day.",

    "story": [
      "The French Open is entering a new era this year now that Rafael Nadal has retired",
      "PARIS -- As the French Open enters a new, post-Rafa, era this year, there are a couple of prevailing sentiments among tennis players.",
      "One is: It's a shame the world won't get to see the King of Clay, as Rafael Nadal came to be called, ply his unique brand of topspin-heavy relentlessness on the crushed red brick of Roland-Garros, where he won a record 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles.",
      "The other, expressed by men who would love to get a chance at carving their own bit of history at the place, goes like this: Whew, it sure will be nice not to have that guy looming in the bracket now that the 38-year-old Spaniard is retired.",
      "\u201cLuckily \u2014 or unluckily \u2014 I never got to play him in Roland-Garros,\u201d said American Tommy Paul, a 2023 Australian Open semifinalist currently ranked 12th.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to not have to worry about him, I guess,\u201d Paul added with a laugh. \u201cThat's the main thing that comes to my mind.\u201d",
      "Players repeatedly used the word \u201cdifferent\u201d to describe what it\u2019ll be like without Nadal around.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be strange for the fans, above all,\u201d said top-10 player Lorenzo Musetti, an Italian who reached the semifinals at Wimbledon and earned an Olympic bronze medal in 2024. \u201cBut the history he made in Paris will never be forgotten.\u201d",
      "To be sure, Nadal's dominance in Paris was unprecedented.",
      "\u201cImpossible,\u201d defending champion Carlos Alcaraz said, \u201cto repeat.\u201d",
      "Nadal collected more championships than any other player at one major tennis tournament, spanning from his first, which arrived two days after his 19th birthday in his 2005 debut, to his last at age 36 in 2022 on a painful foot that required nerve-dulling injections. He went 112-4 overall in the event.",
      "One measure of just how good Nadal was there is reflected in his head-to-head records against the other two members of the Big Three of men's tennis, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. Nadal went 8-2 against Djokovic in the French Open \u2014 accounting for about 15% of all of Djokovic's lifetime Grand Slam losses anywhere \u2014 and 6-0 against Federer.",
      "\u201cWhat a legend. What an ambassador for the sport,\u201d Australian player Thanasi Kokkinakis said about Nadal. \u201cOne of the greatest athletes ever \u2014 not just in tennis.\u201d",
      "He certainly left his indelible mark in Paris. A larger-than-life statue was erected near an entrance to the tournament grounds in 2021, while he was still active; a ceremony honoring him will be held Sunday in the main stadium, Court Philippe-Chatrier, after the first three matches of Day 1.",
      "One would imagine that Nadal will be treated to the sort of applause and chants of \u201cRa-fa!\u201d he heard often, including when he played for the final time at the site \u2014 at the Paris Olympics last year \u2014 and left describing the \u201cunforgettable feeling and emotions\u201d he enjoyed.",
      "And no one who ever faced him, or watched him, at the French Open will forget his lefty whip of a forehand or the way he stood so far back to return serve or the way he chased every ball. Or the way the arena announcer would list off all of his ever-growing list of championship years before a match. Or the way Nadal would bite his trophies after winning one, something Naomi Osaka emulated after claiming her first clay-court title just last month.",
      "\u201cAs a tennis community, everybody\u2019s going to miss Rafa, for sure. If I were thinking about it selfishly, I would say, \u2018Of course I want to watch Rafa play. Of course I want him to be here,'\" former No. 1 and two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka said. \"But I see it a little bit differently. I look at it as that was his decision. Same with when Serena (Williams) left. Of course I miss Serena; she was my biggest motivator. But they\u2019ve moved on in their life to what\u2019s best for them. And I just have so much respect for what they\u2019ve done for the sport. How much they contributed. How much they elevated it. My only thing is to say, \u2018Thank you,\u2019 to players like that.\u201d",

Drivers will be forced to change tires at least twice in the hope that more pit stop strategy could shake up an event where Saturday qualifying \u2014 and the resulting grid position \u2014 is often more important than race day.",
      "\u201cI guess it can go both ways,\" champion Max Verstappen said Thursday. \"It can be quite straightforward, or it can go completely crazy because of safety cars coming into play or not making the right calls. I think it will spice it up probably a bit more.\u201d",
      "The change is designed to stop a repeat of last year, when a first-lap crash brought out the red flag, allowing everyone to make their one mandatory tire change.",
      "With overtaking all but impossible on the twisty Monaco streets, the rest of the race was a procession. Home driver Charles Leclerc took the win for Ferrari and all of the top 10 finished in grid order.",
      "How Sunday's race shakes out could depend on whether teams get creative with their strategies.",
      "\u201cNormally, with one stop, once you have a good pit stop and everything is fine, then you drive to the end and just stay focused and not hit the barrier,\" Verstappen said. \"But maybe with a two-stop it can create something different, people gambling, guessing when the right time is to box.\u201d",
      "Monaco was once McLaren territory. It could be again.",
      "It\u2019s the most successful team with 15 wins in Monaco, but none since Lewis Hamilton took the victory in 2008 on his way to his first championship.",
      "Verstappen\u2019s win at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix last week tightened up a title race which was increasingly dominated by McLaren.",
      "Oscar Piastri leads the standings, but now only by 13 points ahead of his teammate Lando Norris and 22 from Verstappen.",
      "Monaco could favor McLaren because its car tends to be easier on its tires and, as Verstappen said last week, because his Red Bull dislikes low-speed corners.",
      "Ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix, all but two of the 20 F1 drivers were pictured at a private screening Wednesday of the upcoming movie \u201cF1,\u201d starring Brad Pitt and produced by Lewis Hamilton.",
      "Not Verstappen, though, who became a father for the first time a few weeks ago.",
      "\u201cI wanted to spend more private time,\u201d said Verstappen. \u201cThere was the opportunity to watch it, but if I watch it now or in three or four weeks, that\u2019s fine as well.\u201d",

      "Madrid began the season by winning the UEFA Super Cup title but has mostly struggled since then. Many Madrid fans blamed Ancelotti for its relatively poor season, saying he lost control over the squad and wasn\u2019t able to get the team ready for the clasicos against Barcelona, which won the league.

    "story": [
      "The Carolina Hurricanes have found themselves in the same dire position in the conference-final rematch against the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- The frustration bubbled over late in the second period, after the Carolina Hurricanes' latest rush failed to get off a shot while trailing big against the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers.",
      "\u201cShoot the puck! Shoot the puck!\" the pleading chants began before returning for a second stint minutes later, a departure for a venue known for rowdy chaotic zeal building a significant home-ice advantage.",
      "The Hurricanes hadn't forgotten being swept out of the Eastern Conference final two years ago by the Panthers in four one-goal losses. This was supposed to be different. Instead, they're right back in a dire situation \u2014 only worse this time \u2014 against the Panthers after again losing the first two conference-final games at home.",
      "And that has turned a losing streak that was once merely a curious footnote into a growing weight with each passing game.",
      "\u201cI think we're all a little bit at a loss,\u201d Carolina forward Taylor Hall said.",
      "The 5-0 loss in Game 2 marked Carolina's 14th straight loss in a conference final, going back to sweeps in 2009, 2019 and the \u201823 round with the Panthers. The past 10 have come during this current iteration that has won at least one postseason series for seven straight seasons. Parse it further, and the first four came in '19 as a young team happy to be back in the postseason after missing the playoffs for nine straight years before falling to favored Boston.",
      "The past six though? All against the Panthers, with measuring-stick margins getting larger along with the potential for self-doubt as the series shifts south for Games 3 and 4.",
      "\u201cThis game is mental,\u201d Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. \"I mean, it's all about the brain and your focus and the thoughts that can creep in. It's got to be the thoughts we've been thinking all year, and that's playing our game and focusing on our shifts and our battles and doing what we do.",
      "\u201cWhen you let those thoughts like that come in, it never looks good. I think we've got to believe in the group and what we have and what we've done all year, and go steal one in Game 3.\u201d",
      "Does he worry those thoughts could creep into the locker room?",
      "\u201cNo, I think tonight was obviously not great,\u201d Staal said, \u201cbut we're going to have to wash it and move on and own a crappy game.\u201d",
      "Carolina's last conference-final win was Game 7 in 2006 against Buffalo in the franchise's lone Cup title run, with Rod Brind'Amour being the captain who scored the third-period winner against the Sabres. Now he's coaching a team struggling for answers \u2014 any, really \u2014 after a 5-2 loss in Game 1 on Tuesday and a Game 2 that got away about the time Florida's Gustav Forsling scored 77 seconds after the puck drop.",
      "\u201cObviously, we've got to just figure out how to win a period,\u201d Brind'Amour said.",
      "\u201cWe're not going to beat this team if we're not on the same page. And tonight for whatever the reason \u2014 I think the intentions were good, everyone's trying, \u2018OK, I'm going to do this.\u2019 But that's not how we do it. And it just backfired.\"",
      "The formula for Carolina through two five-game playoff series, including against the conference's top-seeded Washington Capitals, remained as straightforward as ever. Use an aggressive forecheck to pressure opponents. Get into the offensive zone and stay there. Fire shots on net, chase rebounds and press the attack.",
      "And oh yes, rely on a penalty kill that had been lights-out good in the playoffs.",
      "Yet the Panthers have carried action with a deep and tested lineup, jumping to 2-0 and 3-0 first-period leads. They've scored four times on the power play, double what Carolina allowed as the postseason's best kill (28 of 30 with one short-handed goal) entering this series rematch.",
      "Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk called Thursday\u2019s start \u201cunreal,\u201d with Florida playing like it expected Carolina\u2019s best punch after a Game 1 thumping. Only that never came, as the Hurricanes struggled to clear the puck or simply gave it away. The performance left Brind\u2019Amour lamenting he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what I was watching\u201d in the first 20 minutes.",
      "The closest thing to a highlight was Sebastian Aho's goal early in the second, one overturned on Florida's offsides review challenge.",
      "Carolina managed three first-period shots, seven through two periods and finished with 17, the lowest of any regular-season or postseason game in Brind'Amour's seven seasons.",
      "\u201cIt's tough to really describe what we need to do unless we play our best game or even close to it,\u201d Hall said.",
      "By the final minutes, there was another meager chant trying to take form.",
      "\u201cCanes in six! Canes in six!\u201d a few fans yelled, trying to keep faith, before quickly fading.",
      "Right now, anyway, the goal is to just get one.",

      "Bianca Pagdanganan is among four players tied for the lead after the first round of the Mexico Riviera Maya Open on the LPGA Tour",
      "PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico -- Bianca Pagdanganan felt right at home in the stifling heat and humidity Thursday on the Yucatan Peninsula, using her power to set up a two-putt birdie on the par-5 18th for a 4-under 68 and a four-way share of the lead in the Mexico Riviera Maya Open.",
      "Pagdanganan, the 27-year-old from the Philippines, managed to hit all but two greens despite not spending much time in the fairway. Her two-putt birdie from 15 feet allowed her to join Chisato Iwai, Jenny Shin and Brianna Do.",
      "The wind was enough of a challenge on the El Camaleon course at Mayakoba. It was the heat index that became the biggest challenge and limited the scoring chances.",
      "Shin was the first to reach 68, making seven birdies but slowed with a double bogey on the 16th hole. Asked about her good start, Shin replied, \u201cI actually don't remember because it's so hot. I don't remember the first birdie.\u201d",
      "But she remembered having a hot putter, mostly for birdie and a few parts. Still, it was hard getting past the stifling conditions.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate heat like this,\u201d Shin said. \u201cI was really shocked when I got here. Definitely does feel like I\u2019m in Southeast Asia. Been hydrating a lot. Drinking a lot of salted water. A lot of electrolytes. I haven\u2019t really been practicing, so I\u2019m going to head straight to the hotel room after this.\u201d",
      "Chisato birdied two of her last five holes, while Do got off to a superb start and was 4 under through her opening five holes. She cooled after that, with one bogey and a birdie on the 18th to claim a share of the lead.",
      "Five more players, including Hye-Jin Choi and Jenny Bae, were at 69.",
      "Charley Hull, at No. 15 in the world the highest-ranked player in the final event before the U.S. Women's Open, missed short putts down the stretch and had to settle for a 72. One of those misses came on the par-5 13th, when she hit her second shot to inside 3 feet.",
      "Pagdanganan felt at relative ease during the round.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a pretty easy round, which honestly I haven\u2019t felt that in a while,\u201d she said. \"To be able to have that out here feels really good. I hit a lot of greens \u2014 not a lot of fairways. But I felt like it didn\u2019t matter that much to me today. I felt like I was swinging it pretty good. I had a pretty clear headspace.",
      "\u201cSo I guess mentally and physically everything just lined up really well for me today.\u201d",

Gaby Lopez, who played a role in getting the LPGA back to Mexico for the first time since 2017, had eight bogeys in her round of 79.

    "story": [
      "The last-place Pittsburgh Pirates have no interest in trading young ace Paul Skenes",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates are reeling, and just about everything is on the table for a last-place team that has already fired its manager and packed a half-decade's worth of public-relations missteps into two months.",
      "Well, except for one thing: trading ace Paul Skenes.",
      "Asked on Thursday if flipping the reigning National League Rookie of the Year is a consideration for a club woefully lacking in impactful position-player prospects, general manager Ben Cherington gave an atypically brief response.",
      "\u201cNo, it's not part of the conversation at all,\u201d Cherington said flatly.",
      "Pittsburgh entered a four-game series against NL Central rival Milwaukee already 11 games out of playoff position, thanks in large part to an offense that ranks last or next-to-last in nearly every major category: from runs, slugging percentage and OPS (all 30th) to home runs and batting average (both 29th).",
      "The Pirates at least showed a small flicker of life at the plate in an 8-5 loss to the Brewers a few hours after Cherington spoke, scoring five runs for the first time in 27 games. Their 26-game streak of four runs or fewer tied a major league record set by four other teams, most recently the then-California Angels in 1969.",
      "Yet it was telling that Pittsburgh also left 10 runners on base, typical of a season in which the Pirates have consistently been unable to take advantage of what few opportunities they create.",
      "Not exactly what the team had in mind during spring training, when everyone from Cherington to Skenes to manager Derek Shelton \u2014 who was jettisoned two weeks ago and replaced by Don Kelly \u2014 talked about the need for Pittsburgh to take another step forward after consecutive 76-86 seasons.",
      "Instead, the Pirates have been stuck in reverse from opening day, even when Skenes starts. Pittsburgh is just 3-5 in his eight starts, the latest loss a 1-0 setback in Philadelphia last weekend in which Skenes limited the Phillies to three hits while throwing the first complete game of his career.",
      "Skenes, who turns 23 next week, has been all-in on the Pirates since being called up a year ago. He's also under team control for the rest of the decade and won't become arbitration-eligible until after 2026, making him one of the biggest bargains in the majors.",
      "While Pittsburgh has locked down players like two-time All-Star outfielder Bryan Reynolds and third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes to long-term deals, they are a pittance by MLB standards compared to what Skenes might command one day should his career continue on its current trajectory.",
      "The Pirates are perennially one of the most frugal teams in the majors. Their opening day payroll this season was just under $88 million. Only the Chicago White Sox, Tampa Bay, the Athletics and Miami spent less.",
      "Even so, Pittsburgh has received little return on its investment. While the bullpen has been a bit of a mess, the starting rotation has been solid. Skenes (2.44), Mitch Keller (3.88), Andrew Heaney (2.91) and Bailey Falter (3.50) all have ERAs under 4.00, yet they also have a combined record of 11-21.",
      "The issue has been a punchless lineup that is largely nondescript outside of Reynolds, franchise icon Andrew McCutchen and center fielder Oneil Cruz.",
      "Pittsburgh has one of the deeper pools of pitching prospects in the majors \u2014 a list that includes hard-throwing 22-year-old Bubba Chandler and Mike Burrows, who gave up four runs over five innings Thursday in his first major league start \u2014 but the cupboard of homegrown position players who are on the cusp of the big leagues remains pretty bare five-plus years into Cherington's tenure.",
      "Catcher Henry Davis, the top overall pick in the 2021 draft, remains a work in progress nearly two full years after his major league debut. Second baseman Nick Gonzales, a first-rounder in 2020, is recovering from an ankle injury and has yet to establish himself as an everyday player. Former first-round picks Termarr Johnson (2022) and Konnor Griffin (2024) are still years away.",
      "So far, the only callups from Triple-A have been mostly injury-related, not performance-related.",
      "\u201cWe want guys from Triple-A to pound the door down,\u201d Cherington said. \"That would be good. I still think that can happen this year. We want more of it over time. ... Everybody knows we\u2019ve got to score more runs. That\u2019s not going to happen just by saying it and hoping for it. You\u2019ve got to do the work to do it.\u201d",
      "Cherington remains optimistic that the major league team will start to turn the corner over the final 110ish games, and he's certain Skenes will be a part of it no matter which way it goes.",
      "\u201cWe've just got to get better,\u201d Cherington said. \"Let\u2019s play better baseball, and that\u2019s going to lead to winning more games. Then, let\u2019s wake up and see where that takes us when we get to July.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Mikko Rantanen has gone four games in a row without scoring, which really isn't as bad as it sounds for the Dallas Stars.",
      "That means they are starting to get more points from other players. Dallas won three of those games, including the second-round finale over top-seeded Winnipeg in Game 6, then the opener in the Western Conference final rematch with Edmonton after a franchise playoff-record five goals in the third period. Three of those came on power plays.",
      "\u201cEveryone was talking about our lack of secondary scoring. The last round ... none of our guys were going to have big numbers in the Winnipeg series,\u201d said coach Pete DeBoer, noting the Jets being the league's top defensive team. \u201cI really felt confident that they were going to get going because even in that Winnipeg series, particularly late in that series, Game 6, I started to see some real signs of creating some real chances ... signs we were going to get some production.\"",
      "The Stars certainly got some chances and production late in the 6-3 victory over Edmonton in Game 1 on Wednesday night. They have the opportunity Friday night to take a 2-0 lead for the first time in 12 playoff series since 2020.",
      "Dallas overcame a multigoal deficit in the third period and won in regulation for the second time this postseason, becoming the first NHL team ever to do that in the same postseason. The Stars' other late comeback was in the first round against Colorado, when Rantanen had a hat trick as part of a four-point third period in Game 7 against his former team.",
      "Matt Duchene finally got his first goal of these playoffs. His tiebreaker against the Oilers was the third consecutive power-play goal in the first six minutes of the third period for Dallas, which was 0 for 14 with a man advantage in a six-game series loss last year.",
      "Esa Lindell also got his first goal. So did Miro Heiskanen, though the standout defenseman played for only the fourth time since Jan. 28. He missed the final 32 regular-season games and first 10 in the playoffs because of left knee surgery.",
      "\u201cReally good for 40 (minutes) and really bad for 20. Ultimately, that\u2019s what it came down to,\u201d Edmonton center Connor McDavid said Thursday. \u201cWhere it got away from us, obviously (was) the kill. A two-goal lead in the third, we take a couple penalties, and we\u2019ve got to find a way to get a kill.\u201d",
      "While the Oilers certainly never anticipated to again keep Dallas completely off the board with a man advantage in another long series, they sure didn't expect to give up three in such quick order.",
      "\u201cThe more time you defend, the more time you\u2019re in a position to take penalties,\u201d Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cWhen they push, you\u2019re in a position to defend, and you\u2019re getting vulnerable to having to take a stick infraction or any kind of infraction. ... They're a good team 5-on-5, exceptionally well on the power play. We have to make adjustments to one, get better on the penalty kill, but also giving them fewer opportunities.\"",
      "Rantanen remains the NHL leader this postseason with his nine goals and 20 points, even with only two assists in the past four games.",
      "That followed a remarkable run when he had a part in an NHL-playoff record 13 consecutive goals for a team. He had back-to-back games with four-point periods against Colorado, his former team, then had another three-goal game in the second-round opener against the Jets.",
      "Leon Draisaitl (six goals) and Connor McDavid (three goals), the 100-point teammates in the regular season, both have 19 points in the playoffs. Draisaitl had a goal and two assists in Game 1 against the Stars, while McDavid had two assists.",
      "Dallas has won consecutive Game 1s after an unexplainable stretch of losing eight consecutive series openers since 2022.",
      "Now the Stars can take a 2-0 series lead for the first time since the second round of the 2020 playoffs, when they went on to beat Colorado in six games and made the Stanley Cup Final in the bubble in Canada during that pandemic-impacted season.",
      "The last time the Stars won their first two games at home in a playoff series was 2016 in the first round against Minnesota.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Some of Harvard\u2019s sports teams would be virtually wiped out by a Trump administration decision announced on Thursday that would make the Ivy League school with the nation's largest athletic program ineligible for international student visas.",
      "Seven of the eight rowers on the men\u2019s heavyweight crew team that just won the Eastern Sprints title \u2014 and is headed to the national championships \u2014 list international hometowns on the school\u2019s website. Mick Thompson, the leading scorer last season, and Jack Bar, who was a captain, are among a handful of Canadians on the men's hockey roster; 10 of the 13 members of the men\u2019s squash team and more than half of the women\u2019s soccer and golf rosters also list foreign hometowns.",
      "Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams are the most in the nation, and Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on the school's rosters for the 2024-25 seasons \u2014 or 196 out of 919 athletes \u2014 had international hometowns. The site noted that some could be U.S. citizens or green card holders who wouldn\u2019t need one of the international visas at issue in an escalating fight premised by the administration's assertions that the school failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday revoked Harvard\u2019s ability to enroll international students, saying the school has created an unsafe campus environment by allowing \u201canti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\u201d to assault Jewish students on campus. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students at the school outside of Boston \u2014 more than a quarter of its total enrollment \u2014 to transfer or leave the country.",
      "Harvard called the action unlawful and said it is working to provide guidance to students. President Alan Garber, noting that he is himself Jewish, said last month after filing a lawsuit to halt a federal funding freeze that the school \u201cwill continue to fight hate with the urgency it demands as we fully comply with our obligations under the law. That is not only our legal responsibility. It is our moral imperative.\u201d",
      "Harvard athletic director Erin McDermott previously declined an interview request from The Associated Press on the potential impact of the visa ban. A Harvard athletics spokesman on Thursday referred a request for comment to the school\u2019s main media information office, which did not immediately respond. The AP also requested comment from three Harvard coaches, who did not respond.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former Harvard hockey player, declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat who played basketball at Harvard, said the athletes are among 85,000 foreign students who come to the state to \u201cstudy, conduct research, start businesses, and create jobs and innovations.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is punishing our students and hurting our economy, all as part of his agenda to silence anyone who disagrees with him,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only ones who benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s actions are China and other countries who are already recruiting these students. It\u2019s the exact opposite of America First.\u201d",

      "It would be tough to top the month Florida coach Todd Golden has enjoyed since winning the national championship",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- It would be tough to top the month Florida coach Todd Golden has enjoyed since winning the national championship.",
      "Golden and the Gators visited the White House on Wednesday, a trip that included an invitation to the Oval Office. He landed one of the top guards in the transfer portal, Arkansas\u2019 Boogie Fland. He threw out the first pitch at a Chicago Cubs game. He received the Winged Foot Award at the New York Athletic Club \u2014 along with a yearlong membership to the famed golf club. And he signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract extension.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d Golden said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s been really awesome getting a lot of these rewards and opportunities because we won. We want to take advantage of it. There\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll ever get this opportunity again. We\u2019re very mindful of that, how hard it is.\u201d",
      "The whirlwind started when Florida rallied from a 12-point deficit in the second half to shock Houston 65-63 in San Antonio on April 7. Golden quickly started to reshape Florida\u2019s roster to replace his entire starting backcourt: Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard.",
      "He landed Princeton\u2019s Xaivian Lee, a 6-foot-4 Toronto native who averaged 16.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists a game last season. He added guard AJ Brown from Ohio University a week later.",
      "But the biggest addition came Tuesday, when Fland signed paperwork to play for the Gators. Fland essentially replaces Denzel Aberdeen, who was expected to step into a starting role but left Florida for Kentucky.",
      "Fland averaged 13.5 points, 5.1 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.5 steals for the Razorbacks last season. The freshman from New York averaged nearly 32 minutes a game.",
      "Now, Lee and Fland will be paired together in an offense that could be even more diverse than the one that set the top two scoring marks in school history the last two years behind Clayton.",
      "\u201cI see it working really, really well,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWhen you have two point guards that are out there making plays, I think it makes your offense really dynamic. So we\u2019re excited. \u2026 They\u2019re both going to have the ball in their hands a ton, being able to play out of the ball screen, being able to push in transition, weapons that teams are going to have to account for.\u201d",
      "With most of Florida\u2019s frontcourt returning \u2014 Golden is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d Alex Condon will be back after going through the NBA's pre-draft process \u2014 the Gators should be a popular pick to repeat as champs.",
      "\u201cOnce we get this new group together, we\u2019ll obviously kind of keep this past season\u2019s success in the equation because we want to try to continue our program at that level,\u201d Golden said. \u201cBut this new group will have a lot to live up to.\u201d",
      "The Gators will reconvene in Gainesville for summer workouts beginning June 9.",
      "Their trip to the White House was the final gathering for the group. Florida flew players, coaches and staff on a 30-person charter to Washington, D.C., and arranged to have everyone else meet them in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Clayton traveled from California. Olivier Rioux, the world\u2019s tallest teenager at 7 feet, 9 inches, made the trip from Canada. Both guys who transferred \u2014 Aberdeen and Indiana\u2019s Sam Alexis \u2014 also rejoined the team along with former assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (now Columbia\u2019s head coach) and John Andrzejek (now Campbell\u2019s head coach). Each of them got their picture taken with President Trump.",
      "\u201cThat was something, again, that these guys will have the rest of their lives,\u201d Golden said.",
      "The 39-year-old Golden probably won\u2019t be in Gainesville for the rest of his career, but he made it clear he has no plans to leave for the NBA \u201canytime soon\u201d despite his new contract including a much lower buyout if he leaves for the pros.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more of just kind of keeping that opportunity potentially available down the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThese contracts, it\u2019s like real-life stuff, so you got to make sure that you give yourself a little bit of opportunity.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the college game, I\u2019m here at Florida for a long time. It\u2019s everything I need, everything my family needs.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "The hackers were trying to obtain details about the type of assistance entering Ukraine and, as part of the effort, sought access to the feeds of internet-connected cameras near Ukrainian border crossings, according to the NSA's report on the cyberattack, which was issued late Wednesday.",
      "The cyber campaign sought to penetrate defense, transportation and logistics companies in several Western countries, including the U.S., as well as ports, airports and rail systems. The report didn\u2019t specify which types of aid Russia was surveilling, but Ukraine\u2019s allies have contributed significant amounts of military and humanitarian assistance since the war began.",
      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",
      "Authorities linked the activity to a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed \u201cFancy Bear\u201d that is well known for its past campaigns targeting the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The hackers used a variety of tactics to gain access, including spearphishing, which involves sending authentic-looking messages to a potential victim that contain links to harmful software or requests for sensitive information.",
      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",

      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "The thefts from the morgue in Boston occurred from 2018 through at least March 2020, prosecutors said. Authorities have said Lodge, his wife and others were part of a nationwide network of people who bought and sold human remains stolen from Harvard and a mortuary in Arkansas.",
      "Denise Lodge and several other defendants have pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the scheme. Prosecutors have said she negotiated online sales of several items, including two dozen hands, two feet, nine spines, portions of skulls, five dissected human faces and two dissected heads.",
      "Authorities have said the dissected portions of cadavers donated to the school were taken without the school\u2019s knowledge or permission.",
      "Bodies donated to Harvard Medical School are used for education, teaching or research purposes. Once they are no longer needed, the cadavers are usually cremated and the ashes are returned to the donor\u2019s family or buried in a cemetery.",

Lopez later sent a mass email to colleagues disputing the company's claims about how its Azure cloud computing platform is used in Gaza.",
      "Lopez's outburst was the first of several pro-Palestinian disruptions at the event that drew thousands of software developers to the Seattle Convention Center. At least three talks by executives were disrupted, the company even briefly cut the audio of one livestreamed event. Protesters also gathered outside the venue.",

The group also says the company has blocked internal emails that mention words including \u201cPalestine\u201d and \u201cGaza.\u201d",
      "Microsoft hasn't returned emailed requests for comment about its response to this week's protests. The four-day conference ends Thursday.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there's a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests.

      "HONG KONG -- Shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, jumped more than 16% Tuesday in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.",
      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",
      "CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.",
      "A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.",
      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",

      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",

The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Health agencies working under Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",

Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

      "But a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain is highly unlikely, industry analysts told ABC News prior to Trump's latest remarks, pointing to the time and expense necessary to overhaul production -- as well as the ongoing cost of higher wages commanded by workers in the U.S.",
      "In theory, the U.S. could host final assembly of Apple products like the iPhone, but even that would take several years and result in higher prices for shoppers, who may then turn to cheaper alternatives, some analysts said.",
      "\"Anything is possible, provided you have a long enough timeframe and don't care about profitability,\" Avi Greengart, lead analyst at research firm Techsponential, told ABC News.",
      "\"It's an incredibly global supply chain. If you want to move it to the U.S., you're talking about many years, possibly decades,\" Greengart added.",
      "Trump last month exempted phones, computers and chips from so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed on China-made goods, which at that time amounted to a 125% levy. The move also excluded such products from a 10% across-the-board tariff imposed on nearly all imports.",
      "The policy change provided major cost savings for Apple, which produces about 90% of its smartphones in China.",
      "\"I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business,\" Trump told reporters at the Oval Office days after the exemption took effect.",
      "Last week, Trump temporarily slashed the reciprocal tariffs on China from 125% to 10% as the U.S. and China hold trade negotiations. China still faces 20% tariffs over its role in the fentanyl trade, bringing total levies on Chinese goods to 30%.",
      "On an earnings call earlier this month, Cook said the company had shifted production of iPhones sold in the U.S. to India as a means of avoiding high tariffs.",
      "\"The majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin,\" Cook said.",
      "However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month in an interview with Fox News that Trump's vision for ushering in a \"golden age\" for America involved enticing manufacturers to open factories and build in the United States. And, he explained, tariffs play into that strategy.",
      "He said that the idea is \"to reshore manufacturing, to build here, to have those people who build here not pay any tariffs.\"",
      "\"We're going to have huge jobs in manufacturing. You've heard the president talk about trillions and trillions of factories being built in America,\" he said in the interview on May 11. \"Those are construction jobs, starting now, and then those products will not have tariffs on them.\"",
      "Cook noted the company already manufactures some components stateside.",
      "\"During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company,\" Cook said. \"All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the US across all 50 states.\"",
      "Still, U.S.-based manufacturing makes up a small share of the company's supply chain \u2013 and any major expansion would take years and carry significant costs, analysts said.",
      "Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush who tracks the tech industry, said last month that it would take three years and cost $30 billion for Apple to shift 10% of its supply chain to the U.S. The price of a U.S.-made iPhone could rise as high as $3,500, Ives said.",
      "\"Price points would move up so dramatically it's hard to comprehend,\" Ives added, describing the notion of a U.S.-made iPhone as a \"nonstarter.\"",
      "The price of an iPhone 16 Pro would jump 25% alone, due to added U.S. labor expenses, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told clients last month in a note shared with ABC News. Such a price hike, which excludes for instance the added cost of factory construction, would bring a $999 smartphone to about $1,250.",
      "A small share of consumers would buy a U.S.-made iPhone even after a significant price hike, but the \"vast majority\" would opt for cheaper alternatives, Ben Bajarin, analyst at research firm Creative Strategies, told ABC News.",
      "The upward pressure on prices as a result of high U.S. labor costs would render domestic manufacturing nearly impossible, presenting Apple with a dilemma, Bajarin said.",
      "\"Production will never happen in the U.S. -- unless we have absolute, fully automated assembly, which completely defeats the purpose because humans won't be doing the jobs,\" Bajarin added.",

    "story": [
      "ABC News obtained audio of Frank Bisignano's staff meeting with managers.",
      "The newly sworn-in head of the Social Security Administration told agency staff this week that when he was first offered the job in the Trump administration, he wasn't familiar with the position and had to look it up online.",
      "Frank Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, said during a town hall with Social Security managers from around the country on Wednesday that he wasn't seeking a position in the Trump administration when he received a call about leading the SSA.",
      "\"So, I get a phone call and it's about Social Security. And I'm really, I'm really not, I swear I'm not looking for a job,\" Bisignano said, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by ABC News. \"And I'm like, 'Well, what am I going to do?' So, I'm Googling Social Security. You know, one of my great skills, I'm one of the great Googlers on the East Coast.\"",
      "\"I'm like, 'What the heck's the commissioner of Social Security?'\" said Bisignano, who now oversees one of the largest federal agencies that's responsible for distributing retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "\"Put that as the headline for the Post: 'Great Googler in Chief. Chief in Googler' or whatever,\" said Bisignano, who throughout the meeting repeatedly bemoaned media leaks from within the agency.",
      "While Bisignano, who previously served as chairman and CEO of financial technology company Fiserv Inc., brings experience managing large organizations and overseeing complex payment systems to his new role, he has no prior history working in government or with the Social Security system.",
      "A Social Security official told ABC News that Bisignano is \"working to transform the agency into a premier service organization.\"",
      "\"He is visiting offices and meeting employees to hear their ideas for how the agency can better serve customers in-person, on the telephone, and online,\" the official said. \"As the Commissioner evaluates the agency, he has been clear that SSA will have the right staffing to deliver Americans their hard-earned benefits.\"",
      "\"Clearly, Commissioner Bisignano was poking fun at himself so that everyone in the room felt comfortable having an open conversation about improving service for the American people,\" the official added.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston, in a statement to ABC News, said, \"Commissioner Bisignano brings a valuable and much-needed outside perspective to the Social Security Administration. Commissioner Bisignano's proven success in the financial services industry uniquely positions him to lead the Trump Administration's commonsense efforts to modernize the agency and improve its efficiency.\"",
      "In Wednesday's 90-minute call, Bisignano sought to calm concerns about the future of the agency amid recent leadership turnover and scrutiny from Elon Musk's government-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "He told the managers in the meeting that Social Security was \"not going away,\" adding that President Trump also agrees with that.",
      "\"This is America's, you know, safety net -- it's not going away. And hopefully you hear me say this every day,\" he said. \"You know who wants me to tell people that? Guess. The president.\"",
      "\"I've gotten notes about, 'Will the turmoil of the last five months end? Are you here to cause more turmoil?'\" he said. \"I don't think it's the turmoil of the past five months, although I will be the fifth since, you know, November, right?\" Bisignano said, referring to being the fifth person put in charge of the critical agency since Trump was reelected in November.",
      "\"Are we having fun yet? Are we OK?\" he asked those on the call.",
      "Bisignano told the managers that they needed to believe that DOGE was \"helping to make things better\" even if \"it may not feel that way.\"",
      "\"Who's heard of DOGE? Raise your hand, right? Your bias has to be, because mine is, DOGE is helping make things better. It may not feel that way, but don't believe everything you read.\"",
      "He said DOGE would be involved in rebuilding the Social Security website and integrating artificial intelligence into the agency's phone support systems.",
      "The head of the agency also told managers that the SSA must adopt a \"digital-first\" mindset to meet the expectations of the American public, comparing the agency to how consumers interact with tech giants like Amazon.",
      "\"You're competing with experiences that people have with Amazon, right? So if I could get something done at Amazon, why can't I get something done the same way with Social Security? That's how people think.\"",
      "Bisignano's officially joins the agency following months of upheaval at the SSA, which has seen a revolving door of leadership amid DOGE's sweeping efforts to overhaul the agency by modernizing its operations and cutting costs. Among the changes DOGE is pushing are staff reassignments, digital infrastructure overhauls, and the controversial outsourcing of certain administrative functions, according to sources.",
      "Bisignano also said he does not intend to implement reductions in force, or RIFs, at the agency, at least for now. \"I have no intent to RIF people, OK? Because that's the big question,\" he said.",
      "When the Wall Street veteran was named Trump's pick to lead the agency, he faced backlash from Democrats and activists who claimed his selection threatened the future of the Social Security program. In early May, lawmakers, union leaders, and activists protested his selection outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of the Senate vote on his nomination.",
      "On Wednesday's call, Bisignano appeared to revel in the news.",
      "\"Did you guys know there was a protest against me? Who knows there was a protest against me?\" he said. \"I like that protest -- I want to prove them so wrong, man, this is going to be most fun I ever had.\"",
      "\"I mean, think of that -- a poor boy from Brooklyn, from a multi-generational household with a dad who worked in the federal government, and senators picketing that I'm going to ruin it,\" he said. \"No way -- make it great, right?\"",
      "Bisignano, during the call, returned several times to his concerns about leaks to the press, suggesting that he would sniff them out.",
      "\"My father was a DA and I'm a detective at heart, so I can figure stuff out,\" he said.",

      "The report blames chronic illnesses on things such as ultra-processed foods.",
      "The White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission offered a range of critiques about chronic disease in America in a report released Thursday, the first major byproduct of the cross-government commission headed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Chiefly, the report blames many chronic illnesses on ultra-processed foods, chemicals in the environment, sedentary behavior and over-reliance on digital devices among children. It also suggests childhood vaccines need to be studied further.",
      "\u201cWe will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic in America, we're going to get it done for the first time ever,\u201d President Donald Trump said during a MAHA event at the White House on Thursday afternoon.",
      "Trump committed to pushing the historically progressive stances outlined in the report and fighting \u201cthe corporate lobbyist or special interest,\u201d calling Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement \u201chot.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnlike other administrations, we will not be silenced or intimidated by the corporate lobbyist or special interest. And I want this group to do what they have to do,\u201d Trump said, mentioning issues like toxic chemicals in the environment, overprescription of children and ultra processed foods.",
      "But Trump's pledges and the findings of the report, while notable for its departure from the president\u2019s priorities in his first term, is still only a very early predictor of what the MAHA movement will attempt to enact -- and how staunchly Trump will stand by the policy changes once they come under fire from industry groups that will certainly fight the administration over any significant regulation.",
      "\u201cOver the next 80 days, the commission will build on its work in this report to develop a roadmap to bold and transformative public health reforms for our consideration. It's a consideration, and we'll lay out the facts. Let me say congratulations to the entire MAHA movement. This movement has become very hot,\u201d Trump said.",
      "For now, the 69-page document still leaves much of the ultimate policy plan unclear, including how much it will cost to address the chronic illnesses that Kennedy is focused on and what steps might be taken to curtail them.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on a call earlier Thursday that the commission doesn't yet have a budget to fund the future health initiatives, noting officials plan to develop policy recommendations in the next few months.",
      "\"There is no budget,\" Kennedy said. \"At this point, there's no concrete policy that could be funded in a budget. We're going to work out the policy recommendations over the next 100 days.\"",
      "\"The next stage of this process is to come up with policy recommendations for the president, and then we'll spend the next four years implementing those policy recommendations,\" he continued.",
      "Despite the lack of budget details, Kennedy maintained that addressing the chronic health issues would save money in the long term.",
      "\"We're going to save a lot more money in the long run and even in the short run, we can reduce the numbers, which we intend to do during this administration,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Officials including Calley Means, a special government employee and adviser to Kennedy who has fought against the presence of ultra-processed foods and pesticides, praised the report.",

      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs may be able to survive a legal challenge, thanks in part to a Japanese zipper company that sued the Nixon administration 50 years ago.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Donald Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs -- basing his ruling on the precedent from a 1970s court case -- but stopped short of issuing an order affirming the president's right to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "In a largely technical ruling issued on Tuesday, U.S. Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred one of the first lawsuits challenging Trump's tariffs to a different federal court while also weighing in on the legality of the controversial tariffs. Florida-based planner company Emily Ley Paper sued over the tariffs in April, asking Wetherell to invalidate them because Trump lacks the power to impose tariffs himself.",
      "According to the judge, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 gives Trump the authority to set tariffs for reasons other than raising revenue. Wetherell wrote that Trump's justification for the tariffs -- both stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the country and resolving a trade imbalance -- is sufficient to satisfy the terms set by Congress.",
      "\"This is a civil action commenced against the United States and it 'arises out of' a federal law\u2014IEEPA\u2014so the dispositive question framed by the parties' filings is whether IEEPA 'provid[es] for \u2026 tariffs,'\" he wrote. \"Defendants contend that it does; Plaintiffs contend that it doesn't. The Court agrees with Defendants ...\"",
      "The decision is at best a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which is fending off a half dozen lawsuits challenging the legality of the recent \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Judge Wetherell ultimately decided to transfer the case from a federal court in Florida to the Court of International Trade in New York, meaning that, despite his favorable view of the tariffs, he won't be the one deciding the case.",
      "But the decision marks the first time a federal judge has suggested Trump's imposition of tariffs falls within his authority as president, offering a positive sign that the Trump administration may find a receptive audience at the Court of International Trade. During two hearings over the last week, judges at the Court of International Trade have wrestled with the same question about Trump's authority.",
      "The question comes down to the interpretation of the 1970s law that Trump used to impose his tariffs. The IEEPA gives the president the right to \"regulate\" imports but does not explicitly mention tariffs. Lawyers challenging the tariffs have argued that Trump's interpretation of the law oversteps his authority by treading into an issue controlled by Congress, but the Trump administration has pointed judges to a court decision related to the IEEPA's legal predecessor -- the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- to guide the way.",
      "Back when President Richard Nixon confronted the country's 1971 economic crisis with steep tariffs on Japanese goods, a zipper company based in Japan called Yoshida sued Nixon over the tariffs.",
      "The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the predecessor to the Court of International Trade, sided with the government and held that the TWAE gives the president the power to impose tariffs.",
      "According to Wetherell, the same reasoning would apply 50 years later to the IEEPA, meaning Trump has the power to impose tariffs without the help of Congress. \"The reasoning in Yoshida is persuasive, and the Court sees no reason why it would not apply to IEEPA because the operative language of IEEPA is identical to the operative language in TWEA,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Despite losing its legal battle, Yoshida remains in business today. Now operating under the name YKK, it produces more zippers than any other company in the world.",

      "A district court had sided with Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board, concluding their firings from their independent agencies were likely illegal and must be reversed.",

      "\"The Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty,\" the majority explained.",

I would do so based on the will of Congress, this Court's seminal decision approving independent agencies' for-cause protections, and the ensuing 90 years of this Nation's history.\"",
      "The case has been closely watched as one of the most high-profile tests of the president's power to control independent agencies created by Congress and designed to be insulated from politics.",
      "Special focus has been on the potential implications of the case for the Federal Reserve. Trump has made his displeasure of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell well-known and threatened to attempt to fire him, even though the appointment to chairman has historically been protected from presidential meddling without cause.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority nodded to those concerns in its order.",
      "\"Respondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris contend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee. We disagree,\" the majority wrote. \"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "The bill passed the House and now faces potential changes in the Senate.",
      "Republicans are celebrating the narrow House passage of a megabill to fund President Donald Trump's domestic agenda as a win for Americans. Democrats are slamming it as benefiting the rich while hurting low-income people.",
      "The \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" passed early Thursday morning by a single vote after marathon talks this week. It now heads to the Senate.",
      "The legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boost spending for the military and border security -- while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs.",
      "It will also add about $3.8 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",
      "The CBO's preliminary analysis of the bill, requested by House Democrats and completed before it was passed by the House, estimated the lowest-income Americans will see their resources decrease while the country's highest earners would see an increase.",
      "\"This is not one big, beautiful bill. It's ugly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on X on Thursday morning.",
      "\"There's nothing beautiful about stripping away people's healthcare, forcing kids to go hungry, denying communities the resources they need, and increasing poverty,\" the New York Democrat said.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued during an overnight hearing that it would \"cause millions of Americans to lose healthcare and food assistance.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, we are here today discussing a bill that would make that American dream harder to reach for millions by increasing costs for families, hardworking American families, and gutting the things that they would need to survive and thrive,\" Jeffries said.",
      "On Medicaid, the Republican bill would implement new work requirements -- targeting able-bodied adults and immigrants, among other beneficiaries -- to kick in no later than the end of 2026 (three years earlier than originally proposed). It also incentivizes states to not expand Medicaid. The CBO estimated it would result in $698 billion less in federal subsidies because of changes to the Medicaid program.",
      "The early CBO estimates put the number of people who could lose coverage at more than 8 million -- but that number continues to fluctuate and the CBO has not yet released its final score of the GOP bill as it continues to be negotiated.",
      "Republicans have defended the moves as trying to remove \"waste, fraud and abuse\" within the program amid a broader administration effort to find savings within the federal government. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday called the work requirements \"commonsense\" and claimed changes to Medicaid will protect benefits for the \"most vulnerable Americans.\"",
      "On SNAP, the megabill would cut the nutrition assistance program by $230 billion, according to CBO estimates. Millions of Americans rely on SNAP for benefits to supplement their grocery budget to afford nutritious food. Adults between the ages of 55 and 64, as well as children, would face additional work requirements to qualify for SNAP benefits.",
      "Several Democrats accused Republicans of rushing the bill in overnight hearings and session to hide such potential impacts from the public.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, during the House Rules Committee's 1 a.m. hearing, asked Republicans what they were \"afraid of.\"",
      "\"It's a simple question that speaks to the heart of what's going on here, and one that I'm going to keep on asking: if Republicans are so proud of what is in this bill, then why are you trying to ram it through in the dead of night?\" he said.",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, called the GOP bill \"Robin Hood in reverse\" during a speech on the House floor Wednesday.",
      "\"This is fiscal engineering to reduce the role of government in the lives of the American people where it most needed, where it is most needed,\" Pelosi said. \"This is Robin Hood in reverse ... Taking resources from where it is most needed, people who need it most, and giving it those who need it less: the billionaires in America. This is shameful and it is a fraud.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Republicans are touting the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime pay, a key pledge during Trump's 2024 campaign to provide relief to working-class families. The elimination applies to workers who make less than $160,000 a year.",
      "The current bill raises the deduction limit of state and local taxes from federal income tax filings from $10,000 to $30,000 for joint filers making less than $400,000 per year.",
      "Trump's tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be made permanent and the bill does not include a tax increase on the wealthiest earners.",
      "One notable change hammered out in negotiations among Republicans was raising the SALT deduction to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000 -- a substantive change from the $10,000 cap that was implemented in the 2017 tax law.",
      "The White House on Thursday promoted the bill as \"the largest tax cut in American history for middle-class families, the working class and small businesses.\"",
      "But the CBO analysis advises it could be top earners who stand to gain the most from the tax cuts.",
      "Taxpayers with the highest incomes could see their household resources increase by 4% in 2027 and 2% in 2033, largely due to the extended tax cuts, the CBO analysis requested by Democrats showed.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 12:18:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Treasury Department says it will phase out production of new pennies early next year.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of making a penny has risen to more than twice the coin's face value.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department says it will phase out production of new pennies early next year after President Donald Trump asked the agency to stop producing the coin that has been part of the American currency for more than 230 years.",
      "The Treasury Department said in a statement that the U.S. Mint, which it oversees, will stop producing new pennies once it runs out of blank templates used to make the mostly copper and zinc coins. The agency confirmed that it made its final order of penny blanks this month.",
      "The retirement of the penny, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is expected to save the Treasury Department around $56 million annually in reduced material costs, according to the department's statement.",
      "\"Additional savings will accrue as facility usage is adjusted and other efficiencies are achieved with the reduced production,\" the Treasury Department said.",
      "The agency announced the move just months after Trump criticized production of the coin in February as being \"wasteful.\"",
      "In an announcement in February on his Truth Social platform, Trump said the cost of minting the coin featuring the profile of the country's 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, is more than twice the currency's face value.",
      "\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies, which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is wasteful!\" Trump wrote. \"I have instructed my Secretary of Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time.\"",
      "According to the U.S. Treasury Department, the cost of producing a single penny has more than doubled in the past 10 years, from 1.3 cents to 3.69 cents in 2024.",
      "Printing a paper $1 bill is cheaper than producing a penny, which, according to the U.S. Mint, is comprised of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper and requires a smelting process to mold the metals. According to the Federal Reserve, it costs Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing 3.2 cents to print a $1 note \u2013 less than the cost of minting a penny.",
      "The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million on making pennies in fiscal year 2024, according to the Mint's annual report to Congress.",
      "The one-cent piece has been part of the fabric of America since 1792. Lincoln's portrait has been embossed on it for 116 years, according the U.S. Mint's website.",
      "There are about 114 billion pennies currently in circulation in the United States, but they are severely underutilized, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "\"Given the cost savings to the taxpayer, this is just another example of our administration cutting waste for the American taxpayer and making the government more efficient for the American people,\" the Treasury Department said in it's statement.",
      "The move would usually require the approval of Congress. Even though it's part of the U.S. Treasury, \"Congress authorizes every coin and most medals that the U.S. Mint manufactures and oversees the Mint's operations under its Public Enterprise Fund,\" according to the Mint's website.",
      "However, Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University professor of constitutional law emeritus at Harvard Law School, told the Associated Press in February that the U.S. Code, a list of general and permanent federal statues, gives Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent the authority to scrap the penny.",
      "\"This action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,\" Tribe said.",
      "The penny will become the 12th U.S. currency denomination to be retired, joining the half-cent coin, the 2-cent coin, the 20-cent piece and the \"trime\" \u2013 a silver three-cent piece issued from 1851 to 1873, Caroline Turco, assistant curator of the Money Museum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, told ABC News.",
      "\"We retired them for multiple different reasons, but normally because they were not being used or they just became too expensive to produce,\" said Turco.",
      "Mark Weller is executive director of Americans for Common Cents, a Washington, D.C., organization that provides research to Congress and the executive branch on the benefits of the penny. He told ABC News that he believes eliminating the coin \"is an absolutely horrible idea.\"",
      "\"It would be bad for consumers and it would be bad for the economy. It really would, in fact, not save money, but it would increase government losses and have some unintended economic consequences,\" Weller said.",
      "Weller \u2013 who disclosed to ABC News that he is also a lobbyist for companies in various industries, including Artazn, a Tennessee-based manufacturer of zinc products, some of which are used in making pennies \u2013 said doing away with the penny would prompt the U.S. Mint to increase production of the nickel.",
      "According to the U.S. Mint, the cost of minting a single nickel is nearly 14 cents, almost three times the coin's face value and more than three-and-a-half times the cost of minting a penny.",
      "\"Without the penny, nickel production could nearly double, which would increase the Mint's losses,\" Weller said. \"So, it's just hard to understand how you could produce more nickels that are losing more money than the penny and say you're going to save money.\"",
      "Weller further said that ditching the penny could lead to the cost of goods going up for American consumers.",
      "\"If there's one thing most economists agree on is that private business has a profit motive. So, the assumption would be that they would price things in a way that they would round up, not round down,\" Weller said.",
      "Although digital payments are increasingly more common, Weller said cash remains a crucial tool, \"especially for someone economically underserved and under-banked.\"",
      "The U.S. Mint produced 3.2 billion pennies in fiscal year 2024, according to the Mint's annual report to Congress, with an estimated 250 billion pennies currently in circulation.",
      "Turco, whose museum is the education branch of the American Numismatic Association, told ABC News that one big misconception about the penny is that, technically, it has never existed in the United States.",
      "\"The American system does not have a 'penny.' That is a misnomer,\" Turco said. \"We have a cent because when we rebelled against the British they had pennies and that is a British word.\"",
      "Turco said the 1-cent piece was first produced in the United States in 1792 and was originally the size of the present-day quarter.",
      "Turco said Lincoln, whose likeness is also on the $5 bill, was added to the coin in 1909.",
      "The United States wouldn't be the first country to eliminate the coin, Turco said. Canada, for example, decided to phase out its penny in 2012. In the U.S., the Department of Defense stopped using pennies at its overseas bases in 1980 because it became too expensive to ship them.",
      "Regardless of the penny's fate, Turco said she believes it will always be a part of the United States, at least colloquially, adding that such phrases as \"a lucky penny\" and \"a penny saved is a penny earned\" will likely always be a part of the American lexicon. Perhaps, ironically, the penny's value could increase if its discontinued.",
      "\"I think collectors will still enjoy having them,\" Turco said. \"But I don't think that the value of a penny will just skyrocket overnight.\"",

      "House Republicans approved the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda early Thursday.

      "Trump is pushing for swift action on his megabill, urging senators in a post on X to act \"as soon as possible\" after the narrow victory in the House.",
      "\"We can celebrate this pass in the House for a couple of hours, but now it's time for the Senate to get to work,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Thursday's White House press briefing. \"The president has great relationship with ... Senate Majority Leader [John] Thune, and of course, so many friends on the Senate side of the Hill. And he's expecting them to get busy on this bill and send it to his desk as soon as possible.\"",
      "Senate Republicans say they're clear-eyed about wanting to pass Trump's legislative agenda into law as swiftly as they can, but have every intention of modifying the bill to leave their own distinct mark on the package and working to change things they object to.",
      "Majority Leader Thune said Wednesday that \"there are things that we need to adjust or modify or change,\" adding that Speaker Mike Johnson \"fully understands and accepts that.\"",
      "Chief among the issues GOP senators have raised about the bill is that it adds trillions of dollars to the national debt.",
      "\"[The] House bill is going to add about $4 trillion to the debt ceiling. The Senate bill adds $5 trillion. There's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul said Thursday. \"This will be the greatest increase in the debt ceiling ever, and the GOP owns this now \u2026 the deficit this year will be $2.2 trillion the GOP owns that now too.\"",
      "Some Senate Republicans are calling for steeper spending cuts so that raising the debt limit would not be part of this bill.",
      "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a notable fiscal hawk, has also signaled strongly that he would not support the bill in its current form, given that it raises the deficit.",
      "\"It's so far off the mark. It's so bad. I've been trying to interject reality. I've been trying to interject facts and figures,\" Ron Johnson told reporters on Wednesday afternoon at the Capitol, as the House was still advancing the bill through the Rules Committee.",
      "\"Currently the fiscal situation is not even in the conversation in the House debate. We're missing the forest talking about twigs and leaves. Medicaid, that's, that's a tree. That's a big enough issue. But all this, all this, all these little tweaks they're trying to make to get the deal completely ignores the elf in the room.. which says, on average, I mean, current [Congressional Budget Office] estimate, on average, we'll have a $2.2 trillion deficit, per year,\" Sen. Johnson added.",
      "A few GOP Senators seemed more supportive of the bill, but noted there was significant work needed to be done in order to pass through the upper chamber.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said \"a lot of it looks pretty good,\" adding that it's a \"good start.\"",
      "\"Still, I think there's some opportunities for more efficiency, some more savings, and we have to look at the specifics of some of the renewable investment tax credits and production tax credits, and I think that even if we're going to revise them, we've got to make sure that businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs,\" he added.",
      "If the bill is retooled by the Senate, it risks a complicated path for the speaker down the road when the bill goes back to the House. Republicans have set a Fourth of July deadline for both chambers to pass the bill and get it to Trump's desk.",
      "Passing this massive package through the Senate is also no cakewalk for Thune, who will only be able to afford to lose three of his members if it comes up for a vote on the Senate floor.",

      "After laboring for days to push for steeper spending cuts and repeatedly railing against the spending that added to the bloated national deficit, many of the holdouts caved.",
      "\"The Freedom Caucus was instrumental, and we held it out as long as we could to get the cuts, as long as we could. We couldn't do it any longer. We live to fight another day,\" Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, a key holdout, told reporters.",

      "That number of \"more than a dozen\" holdouts also included Republicans from states like New York and California, pushing for a higher cap on the state and local tax deduction. Speaker Johnson raised that cap from its proposed $30,000 to $40,000, and increasing 1% a year thereafter. That was enough to get their support.",
      "But, for the spending hawks, it's unclear how they can characterize this as a win.",
      "Leavitt said Thursday that she believes that Trump would want to see the two Republican representatives who voted no on the bill -- Reps. Thomas Massie and Warren Davidson -- should be primaried.",
      "\"I don't think he likes to see grandstanders in Congress. What's the alternative? I would ask those members of Congress. Did they want to see a tax hike? Did they want to see our country go bankrupt? That's the alternative by them trying to vote no,\" Leavitt said.",

      "The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles from the libraries of their military educational institutions that touch on diversity, race, and gender issues using the Pentagon's specific search terms.",
      "Prior to the Pentagon memo standardizing search terms, the Navy used its own terms that identified 381 titles, including titles like \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou, \"How to Be an Antiracist\" by Ibram X.

      "Unhappy that Apple intends to source nearly all of its U.S. iPhones from India, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on the popular device unless the tech giant moves production to the United States",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Unhappy that Apple intends to source nearly all of its U.S. iPhones from India, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on the popular device unless the tech giant moves production to the United States. But Apple has seen little incentive in the past to manufacture domestically.",
      "Apple has traditionally produced its devices in China, in massive factories that rely on a vast network of local suppliers. The company's reliance on this relationship thrust the technology trendsetter into the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "In response to the president's recent exchange with China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would, if made in America, jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S. Combined with current economic forces, the price of an iPhone could triple, threatening to torpedo sales of Apple's marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a nonstarter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. On a quarterly earnings call earlier in May, Cook told investors that tariffs had a \u201climited impact\u201d on the company in the March quarter because it was able to optimize its supply chain. But Cook warned that it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to predict beyond June \u201cbecause I\u2019m not sure what will happen with tariffs.\u201d",
      "Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of Trump's escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS News program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that tour, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Thursday curtailing what kind of development can happen in Florida\u2019s prized state parks",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Thursday curtailing what kind of development can happen in Florida\u2019s prized state parks \u2014 giving his approval to legislation that came in direct response to his administration\u2019s push to build golf courses, pickleball courts and hotels on conservation lands.",
      "Unlike issues of abortion, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, race and guns that have divided voters, state parks apparently hold a place in the hearts of Floridians regardless of party.",
      "The development plans drew widespread, bipartisan backlash last summer. Hundreds of nature lovers and conservationists thronged to protests at parks across the state, carrying signs with slogans like \u201cSave Don\u2019t Pave\u201d and \u201cParks Over Profit.\u201d",
      "The law, which goes into effect July 1, was unanimously approved by both chambers of Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature. It specifically bans the construction of golf courses, ball fields and sports facilities in state parks, and requires government officials to give Floridians at least 30 days\u2019 notice ahead of public hearings to discuss proposed changes to the conservation areas.",
      "The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.",
      "DeSantis signed the law days after another wave of bipartisan backlash scuttled a company's plans to swap some its properties for state-owned conservation lands.",
      "Organizers for the environmental group Sierra Club Florida called the state park law a monumental victory for grassroots activism in a politically divided state.",
      "\u201cToday, we celebrate a turning point not just for our environment, but for the future of Florida,\u201d said Javier Estevez, the group's political and legislative director.",
      "The bipartisan push to rein in DeSantis\u2019 administration is a sign of how the governor's once rock-solid support from fellow Republicans has eroded. Until recently, it was rare for DeSantis to get pushback on anything from the GOP lawmakers who dominate the state\u2019s politics, and he has a reputation for seeking vengeance when they do.",
      "But it appears a political line in the sand has been drawn around Florida\u2019s beloved state parks, which are a bastion of wildness in a state where vast stretches of white-sand beaches and mangrove forests have long given way to high rise condos, roadside motels and strip mall souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThis bill really provides safeguards and protections to our state parks,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Gayle Harrell, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, adding there is \u201cno wiggle room\u201d for unwanted development.",
      "Harrell\u2019s South Florida district includes Jonathan Dickinson State Park, where DeSantis\u2019 Department of Environmental Protection had proposed building a golf complex. That would have entailed removing a boardwalk and observation tower and relocating the residences and offices of park staff, as well as existing cabins for visitors.",
      "Harrell said last summer's widespread protests pushed the issue to the forefront of the legislative agenda.",
      "\u201cIt took the entire state of Florida to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is democracy at work.\u201d",
      "Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, declared the law's passage a \u201chuge win\u201d over the state\u2019s powerful development interests.",
      "\u201cPeople really want to build golf courses on some of our more protected lands in the state. Instead, we made it (the protections) stronger,\u201d Samples said. \u201cWe did this. All of us did this together.\u201d",
      "The Republican governor has distanced himself from the development proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land.",
      "The DeSantis-appointed environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intense scrutiny and bipartisan pushback on the initiative. In November, DeSantis tapped a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",

    "story": [
      "Retired firefighter Mark Whaling knows firsthand what it\u2019s like to wait on a helicopter to refill on water while he's battling a blaze on the ground",
      "CABAZON, Calif. -- Mark Whaling and a crew raced up and down a hill in a tanker truck as they battled a wildfire in Los Angeles County, scrambling to get water from a street hydrant in time to stay ahead of flames moving up a ridge. A helicopter flew in to drop water, but it had to fly a long distance to refill \u2014 and a fire that might have been stopped went on to destroy homes.",
      "As they fought that early 2000s blaze, Whaling says, he spotted a sealed, million-gallon water tank nearby that firefighters had no way of accessing. He thought that was ridiculous.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t tell fire engines, \u2018Protect the city and go find your own water.\u2019 We put fire hydrants every 600 feet all around cities,\u201d said Whaling, who has since retired from the county fire department. \u201cBut when it comes to the helicopters, we weren\u2019t supporting them as robustly as we should.\u201d",
      "His frustration sparked an idea: the Heli-Hydrant, a relatively small, open tank that can be rapidly filled with water, enabling helicopters to fill up faster for urban fires rather than flying to sometimes distant lakes or ponds.",
      "As wildfires become more frequent, Whaling's invention is getting the attention of officials eager to boost preparedness. First used for the 2020 Blue Ridge Fire in Yorba Linda, 10 Heli-Hydrants have been built across Southern California and 16 more are in progress, according to Whaling.",
      "Helicopters are essential for firefighting. They can drop 1,000 gallons (about 3,785 liters) of water at once \u2014 some much more. That's far more than hoses than get on a fire all at once, and can be the best way to attack fires that are difficult for ground crews to reach.",
      "But pilots sometimes have to fly a long way to scoop up water, and in drought-prone areas, natural sources can sometimes dry up or diminish so they're hard to draw from. In Southern California's Riverside County, helicopters have had to fly up to 10 miles (about 16 kilometers) to find water, eating critical time from battling fires.",
      "On a remote plot in the Southern California town of Cabazon, contractor Glenn Chavez stood on a ladder and peered into an empty Heli-Hydrant. A radio in hand, he clicked a button to activate the system and watched as water roared into the tank. In about six minutes, it filled with 8,500 gallons (32,176 liters).",
      "Chavez, a general contractor, was testing the Cabazon Water District\u2019s lastest investment \u2014 a second Heli-Hydrant that local officials are counting on to help protect the town. At $300,000, it cost slightly less than the average price of a single home in Cabazon.",
      "\u201cLiving in a beautiful desert community, you're going to have risks of fire,\" said Michael Pollack, the district's general manager. \"And to have these Heli-Hydrants is a major advantage. People will have a little bit of comfort knowing that they have another tool for fighting fires in their community.\"",
      "Pilots can remotely activate the tanks from half a mile away, with the tank typically filling quickly from a city's water system. Helicopters can fill up in less than a minute. Once it's activated, solar panels and backup batteries ensure the system can still be used during power outages. And at night, lights from the tank and a tower nearby guide pilots toward it.",
      "In November, fire responders in San Diego put the product to the test when the 48-acre Garden Fire in Fallbrook, a community known for its avocado groves, prompted evacuation orders and warnings. Helicopters tapped the tank nearly 40 times.",
      "Pilot Ben Brown said its proximity to the fire saved not just time but fuel.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re great for when you don\u2019t have other water sources,\u201d he said. \"The more dip sites, especially in some of the more arid environments in the county, the better.\u201d",
      "Heli-Hydrants have raised some concerns about their placement in urban areas where houses, buildings and power lines can be obstacles to flight and they might have to squeeze into tighter spaces.",
      "In those cases, firefighters may choose to fly farther to a natural source that gives the helicopter more room, said Warren Voth, a deputy pilot with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. A pilot's goal is to always to face the wind while entering and exiting an area, for safety, and they need room to accomplish that.",
      "In some cases, the municipal systems needed to fill Heli-Hydrants could go empty during major fires. As the Palisades Fire in Los Angeles burned, three 1-million gallon tanks that helped pressurize city hydrants in the Pacific Palisades ran dry as demand soared and burning pipes leaked water.",
      "Other times, helicopters just can't access them. When winds are fierce, flying is nearly impossible; hurricane-force winds that supercharged the Los Angeles infernos initially grounded firefighting aircraft. When multiple helicopters respond to large blazes, they can't all use the Heli-Hydrant. And smoke can make it hard to see it.",
      "Portable water tanks can accomplish some of the things that Heli-Hydrants do, but can require time, people and equipment to set up.",
      "Areas where wildland vegetation intersects with human development have always been vulnerable to fires, but more people are living in them today, and climate change is creating conditions that can make these regions drier and more flammable.",
      "Jake Wiley has seen intensifying wildfires devastate his community. Two blazes \u2014 in 2007 and 2017 \u2014 collectively scorched more than 400 structures in San Diego. The last one forced Wiley, now general manager for the Rainbow Municipal Water District, to evacuate.",
      "That fire also prompted local agencies to install a Heli-Hydrant \u2014 and when the Garden Fire erupted in November, it played a big role helping firefighters protect homes.",
      "\u201cIt seems like when you've seen the worst, you haven't yet,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cAnything we can do helps.\u201d",

      "News that air traffic controllers directing planes into New Jersey\u2019s busiest airport twice lost both their radar and radios is alarming",
      "It was alarming news when air traffic controllers directing planes coming and going around one of the nation's busiest airports repeatedly lost their radar and radio communications, but pilots, independent air safety experts and the Federal Aviation Administration say other redundant systems kept planes from colliding.",
      "\u201cI think the risk of a collision or an incident was increased, but not significantly because of the redundancy in the aviation system,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Crashes like January's deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter usually have different causes \u2014 a combination of many things that go wrong, he says.",
      "Here's a look at what happened in Newark \u2014 and how key pieces of the safety net protected planeloads of people.",
      "The radar and communications systems that a terminal control team in Philadelphia relies on to direct planes in and out of Newark International Airport simultaneously failed twice in the past month for brief periods. The main line that carries the radar signal from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn\u2019t work immediately. The system relies in part on aging copper wires and even when there are fiber optic lines, the signal has to be slowed down when it reaches the facility because the FAA computers are so old they can't handle all the data at full speed.",
      "As a result, the controllers were suddenly unable to see or communicate with planes coming from or going to Newark for as long as 90 seconds on April 28 and May 9. Their radar screens showing each flights in motion suddenly went black. Their radio connections went silent.",
      "The main line failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online. The FAA said a fourth outage Monday knocked out radio communications for two seconds, but the radar stayed online.",
      "After the initial outage, the already shorthanded control center in Philadelphia lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. Newark's terminal control team could no longer manage a full schedule of handoffs with the airport's control tower, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays that rippled across the nation's airlines. The FAA then imposed safety limits, allowing no more than 28 arrivals and 28 departures every hour. Before, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly.",
      "When air traffic controllers lose the ability to see or speak to airborne planes, they can try text messaging the pilots via data link systems or try high-powered portable radios. An emergency radio frequency might also be an alternative if main communications are down. Tower controllers have high-powered light guns to send a green or red signal to pilots to let them know if they are clear to land even if they can't talk to them over the radio.",
      "And the entire air traffic control system is built on an overlapping network of radar sites. So if a terminal control team like the one in Philadelphia loses its communications, a controller in a radar center that normally directs planes at higher altitudes might step in. If some other controller in the area hears a pilot broadcasting on an emergency frequency, they too can relay a message.",
      "During these Philadelphia outages, voice communications came back online first while the radar took another minute to reboot, and controllers were able to hand off planes without having to resort to some of those other options.",
      "In a May 9 recording captured by www.liveATC.net, a controller can be heard saying \u201cFedEx 1989. I'm going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again. If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\u201d The pilot acknowledged that and wished the controllers \u201cgood luck guys\u201d before switching frequencies.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau has tried to reassure the public that all these backups and limits on the number of flights keep flying safe, despite these problems that have exposed how fragile and outdated some air traffic control systems have become.",
      "\u201cWhen disruptions occur at any airport because of equipment issues or staffing, the FAA will always ensure safety by slowing down airport arrivals and departures and reducing congestion,\u201d Rocheleau posted on X. \u201cWe keep the flying public safe because there are redundancies built throughout the entire system used by pilots, technicians and air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Every pilot is trained on what to do if they can't talk to the air traffic controllers, and modern passenger jets have their own backup systems. Airline pilots all regularly get refresher training emphasizing safety.",
      "Capt. Miles Morgan oversees all training for 17,000 United Airlines pilots at a facility in Denver filled with simulators and classrooms. He said losing communications is rare, but it's something pilots prepare for, as most training focuses on what to do if something goes wrong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for 30 years. I\u2019ve got almost 18,000 hours in United airplanes -- jets, and I\u2019ve lost communication one time,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt really ended up not being that big of a deal. I just went to the emergency frequency, got a different channel, and contacted a different facility to get back into communication.\u201d",
      "In addition to multiple communications systems, planes are equipped with collision avoidance technology that shows pilots where all the other planes are moving around them. These systems alert pilots to an approaching aircraft's trajectory and can recommend evasive action to prevent a collision if planes get too close, Morgan said.",
      "Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said that when pilots lose contact with controllers, their first action is to continue on their last-directed path. If the outage continues, they'll broadcast their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower \u2014 as they follow their flight plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to downplay the seriousness of communication failure or radar outages, but it\u2019s to recognize that we have procedures, we trained to those procedures, and we have additional equipment that can only enhance the safety margin while we deal with that scenario,\u201d Tajer said.",

      "In 2020, after a summer of protests rocked U.S. cities, the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d went from the rallying cry of racial justice demonstrators to words lining the very roads along which they marched.",
      "After the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, towns and cities nationwide commissioned artists to paint BLM street murals in solidarity with the reckoning on police brutality and racism prompted by the unprecedented, multiracial mass rallies.",
      "Five years on, many of the murals are still maintained by activists and community groups, while wear and tear, construction and vandalism spelled the end of others. And the mural widely thought to have inspired them all \u2014 35-foot-tall (11-meter-tall) yellow capital letters painted on a street one block from the White House \u2014 is gone.",
      "Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C., ordered crews to remove the BLM mural in March under pressure from the Republican-led Congress. Bowser noted that the mural \u2014 an act of defiance against President Donald Trump's first administration \u2014 \u201cinspired millions of people and helped our city through a painful period.\u201d",
      "Keyonna Jones, one of seven artists who painted Black Lives Matter Plaza, said she understands why Bowser acted and that the mural's removal doesn't take away from its historic importance.",
      "\u201cTo see it replicated all over the world within 24 hours,\u201d Jones said during the demolition of the plaza. \"I think is what really speaks to the power of art and so that is my favorite part about the whole experience.\"",
      "According to Urban Art Mapping, a database of public street art, nearly 150 \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d murals remain.",
      "Lindsey Owen, an art historian in Chicago, said each one represents the shared cultural and political purpose of a community.",
      "\u201cEven as BLM Plaza is dismantled, the reciprocal mirroring of these murals ensures their persistence,\u201d Owen said, \u201cnow also reflecting the absence of spaces that have been removed.\u201d",
      "Here are details of some notable BLM murals:",
      "In 1899, Hobson City became Alabama's first self-governed all-Black municipality. In 2020, residents including Mayor Alberta McCrory painted \u201cBlack Towns Matter\u201d on its main street, Martin Luther King Boulevard.",
      "In Montgomery, a temporary installation was established around Court Square Fountain, once the site of a slave market. City officials said the mural will be washed away once wear and tear begin to show.",
      "Michelle Browder, the artist, said her design reflects the history of the area, and that the community signaled a readiness to address racial inequity by uniting to complete the mural.",
      "\u201cIt gives us a sense of uniqueness and shows that our statement has not only significance but also invites people to look down, read and reflect on what happened in this space,\u201d Browder said.",
      "In downtown Oakland, residents and community groups painted \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d along three blocks of 15th Steet. A month later, another mural was erected by The Queer Healing Arts Center honoring Black Trans and Queer Lives.",
      "The city council in neighboring Berkeley then approved a BLM painting in front of city hall.",
      "A rainbow-colored mural along the center lane of Los Angeles' Hollywood Boulevard states \u201cAll Black Lives Matter\u201d in celebration of the BLM movement and transgender people of color.",
      "Mural designer, Luckie Alexander, said its message resonates stronger than ever today.",
      "\"Seeing the BLM Plaza (in Washington) destroyed feels like we are going back in time, when Black folks and LGBTQ+ had to struggle just to exist,\" Alexander said. \u201cWith the one here in Hollywood still remaining, it gives me hope that California is still a safe place to live.\u201d",
      "In Hartford, a Black Lives Matter mural \u2014 each letter painted by a different artist \u2014 was created on Trinity Street, just steps from the Capitol. That mural was repainted in 2023 after it was defaced with a swastika.",
      "Andre Rochester, who painted one of the Ts in 2020 and 2023, said the mural represents the city's Black and brown population.",
      "\u201cIt was placed with intention,\u201d Rochester said, adding: \u201cIt makes a loud statement, that the City of Hartford cares.\u201d",
      "Tyrone Motley, who inked the V during the 2023 repainting, said it is important that Hartford continues to protect the mural even as others around the country disappear.",
      "\u201cI feel work like this is ageless,\u201d Motley said. \u201cI'm pretty sure in 10 years people can look at a piece like this and still get the message.\u201d",
      "A \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d mural in St. Petersburg mural was repainted in 2023 to read \u201cBlack History Matters.\u201d",
      "One of the murals that sprung up across Chicago \u2014 a 100-foot (30-meter) \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d display in Oak Park \u2014 was vandalized to read \u201cAll Lives Matter.\" The original message was later restored.",
      "In Minneapolis, where a bystander used her cellphone to record Floyd's killing at the hands of police, 16 artists participated in the creation of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in 24-foot-high (7-meter-high) letters on the street outside the Minnesota African American Heritage Museum.",
      "In Florissant, activists attempted to paint a mural in front of the police department on North Lindberg Avenue but the city kept painting over it.",

      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",

      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",

      "Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact.",
      "His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or \u2014 through repetition \u2014 no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away.",
      "Here's a look at some of Trump's showstopping utterances this term and where they stand.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an \u201cexpanded and rebuilt\u201d Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades \u2014 and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn't said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he's ordered an \u201cassessment to determine our needs and the next steps,\u201d even as California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a \u201cdistraction.\u201d Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as \u201cThe Rock,\u201d which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the \u201cGreat State of Canada\u201d with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada \u201cwon\u2019t be for sale, ever.\u201d Trump responded, \u201cnever say never.\u201d Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn't divulge Trump's reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between \u201ca wish and a reality.\u201d Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a \u201cwonderful marriage.\u201d",

Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty \u2014 while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away.",

Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, \u201cI'm going to go with Elon.\u201d He then drew sustained applause by asking, \u201cWould anybody like to join us?\u201d Nothing has come of it since.",

He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East,\u201d once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed \u201cTRUMP GAZA.\u201d During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could \u201cget involved\u201d in Gaza \u201cand make it just a freedom zone.\u201d The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations.",
      "WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking.",
      "BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It's an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor's mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump's repeated complaints about Biden's autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,\u201d he said this week.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Since President Donald Trump announced his intent to end a half-century of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a debate has developed in his administration over how quickly and thoroughly that should happen.",
      "At risk could be the future of a transitional government run by those who drove Syrian leader Bashar Assad from power late last year and hopes that it can stabilize the country after a devastating 13-year civil war that has left millions dead or displaced, the economy in ruins and thousands of foreign fighters still on Syrian soil.",
      "U.S. presidents have piled up penalties over the years on the autocratic family that previously controlled Syria, and those could be quickly lifted or waived through executive action. But Congress imposed some of the strictest measures and would have to permanently remove them.",
      "Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, the former militant commander who led the overthrow, says he is working to build an inclusive government friendly to the West. Some Trump administration officials are pushing to lift or waive sanctions as fast as possible without demanding tough conditions first.",
      "Others in the administration have proposed a phased approach, giving short-term waivers soon on some sanctions and then tying extensions or a wider executive order to Syria meeting conditions, which could substantially slow \u2014 or even permanently prevent \u2014 longer-term relief. That would impede the interim government\u2019s ability to attract investment and rebuild Syria after the war, critics say.",
      "\u201cThe Syria sanctions are a complex web of statutes, executive actions and United Nations Security Council resolutions that have to be unwound thoughtfully and cautiously,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman Max Bluestein said.",
      "The administration is \u201ccurrently analyzing the optimal way to do so\u201d and would have an announcement soon, Bluestein said in a statement Thursday to The Associated Press.",
      "A State Department proposal circulated among officials after Trump's pledge on his Middle East trip last week lays out sweeping conditions for future phases of relief or permanent lifting of sanctions, including dismantling Palestinian militant groups as a top demand, according to a senior U.S. official familiar with the plan, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Additional proposals are circulating, including one shared this week that broadly emphasized taking all the action possible, as fast as possible, to help Syria rebuild, the official said.",
      "People danced in the streets of Damascus after Trump announced in Saudi Arabia last week that he would \u201cbe ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're taking them all off,\u201d Trump said a day before meeting the country\u2019s new leader. \u201cGood luck, Syria. Show us something special.\u201d",
      "This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio advocated for a hedged approach in testimony before U.S. lawmakers.",
      "Rubio pushed for sanctions relief to start quickly, saying Syria\u2019s five-month-old transition government could be weeks from \u201ccollapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions.\u201d",
      "But asked what sanctions relief should look like overall, Rubio gave a one-word explanation: \u201cIncremental.\u201d",
      "Washington has levied sanctions against Syria's former ruling family since 1979 over its support for Hezbollah and other Iranian-allied militant groups, its alleged chemical weapons program and its brutality against civilians as the Assad family fought to stay in power.",
      "The sanctions include heavy penalties for outside companies or investors doing business there. Syria needs tens of billions of dollars in investment to restore its battered infrastructure and help the estimated 90% of the population living in poverty.",
      "Syria\u2019s interim leaders \u201cdidn\u2019t pass their background check with the FBI,\u201d Rubio acknowledged to lawmakers this week. The group that al-Sharaa led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was originally affiliated with al-Qaida, although it later renounced ties and took a more moderate tone. It is still listed by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.",
      "But al-Sharaa's government could be the best chance for rebuilding the country and avoiding a power vacuum that could allow for a resurgence of the Islamic State and other extremist groups.",
      "\u201cIf we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we do not engage them, it was guaranteed to not work out,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the U.S.-based Syrian Emergency Task Force and an advocate who has been influential in helping shape past U.S. policy on Syria, said he has been circulating a framework for a proposed executive order that would allow Trump to quickly remove many of the sanctions.",
      "Trump\u2019s move to lift the penalties is aimed at \u201cpreventing a failed state and ending perpetual violence,\u201d but some in the administration are trying to \u201cwater down\u201d the decision, Moustafa asserted.",
      "The initial document sent out last week by the State Department's policy and planning staff proposed a three-phase road map for sanctions relief, starting with short-term waivers. Progress toward additional relief and an outright lifting of penalties in future phases would be tied to tough conditions that generated pushback from some officials.",
      "Removing \u201cPalestinian terror groups\u201d from Syria is first on the list of requirements to get to the second phase. Supporters of sanctions relief say the condition might be impossible, given the subjectivity of determining which groups meet that definition and at what point they can be declared removed.",
      "Other conditions for moving to the second phase are for the new government to take custody of detention facilities housing Islamic State fighters in northeast Syria and to carry out a recent deal with the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 which manages the detention facilities \u2014 that includes the SDF being incorporated into the Syrian army.",
      "To get to phase three, Syria would be required to join the Abraham Accords \u2014 normalized relations with Israel \u2014 and to prove that it had destroyed all of the previous government\u2019s chemical weapons.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously pushed for the Trump administration not to lift sanctions on Syria. Israel has been suspicious of the new government, although Syrian officials have said publicly that they do not want a conflict with Israel.",
      "Since Assad fell, Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes and seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in Syria.",
      "While some of the sanctions can be lifted by executive action, others face a more complex process.",
      "The most difficult could be the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, a wide-reaching set of sanctions passed by Congress in 2019 in response to alleged war crimes by Assad\u2019s government.",
      "It specifically blocks reconstruction activities, and although it can be waived for 180 days by executive order, investors are likely to be wary of reconstruction projects when sanctions could be reinstated after six months.",
      "In a meeting last week in Turkey with Syria's foreign minister, Rubio and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham explained that they supported Trump\u2019s call to ease sanctions immediately but that permanent relief would require action by the Syrian government to meet conditions that the president laid out, according to other U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "\u201cWe have a moment here to provide some capability to this new government that should be conditions-based,\u201d Graham said this week. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want that moment to pass.\u201d",

      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November. Arizona was one of a handful of states that passed ballot measures in the 2024 general election enshrining the right to abortion to their state constitutions.",
      "Earlier this year, an Arizona judge blocked the state's 15-week abortion ban.",
      "Peter Gentala, president of Center for Arizona Policy, a socially conservative nonprofit, said it is too early to determine if the organization will intervene in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s health is important and this lawsuit reflects an agenda to maximize abortion in Arizona and that comes at a cost to women\u2019s health,\u201d he said.",

      "An Indigenous tribe from the Brazilian Amazon has sued the New York Times over the newspaper's reporting on the community's introduction to the internet",
      "LOS ANGELES -- An Indigenous tribe from the Brazilian Amazon has sued The New York Times, saying the newspaper's reporting on the tribe's first exposure to the internet led to its members being widely portrayed as technology-addled and addicted to pornography.",
      "The Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the rainforest, filed the defamation lawsuit seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages this week in a court in Los Angeles.",
      "It also names TMZ and Yahoo as defendants, alleging that their stories amplified and sensationalized the Times' reporting and smeared the tribe in the process.",
      "The suit says the Times' June 2024 story by reporter Jack Nicas on how the group was handling the introduction of satellite service through Elon Musk's Starlink \u201cportrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese statements were not only inflammatory but conveyed to the average reader that the Marubo people had descended into moral and social decline as a direct result of internet access,\u201d an amended version of the lawsuit filed Thursday says. \u201cSuch portrayals go far beyond cultural commentary; they directly attack the character, morality, and social standing of an entire people, suggesting they lack the discipline or values to function in the modern world.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, a Times spokesperson said: \u201cAny fair reading of this piece shows a sensitive and nuanced exploration of the benefits and complications of new technology in a remote Indigenous village with a proud history and preserved culture. We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The theme of Nicas' story was that after less than a year of service, the community was now facing the same kinds of struggles with the pervasive effects of the internet and the proliferation of smartphones that much of the world has dealt with for years.",
      "Nicas listed a broad range of those challenges: \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography.\u201d",
      "He later wrote that a tribal leader \u201cis most unsettled by the pornography. He said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats, a stunning development for a culture that frowns on kissing in public.\u201d",
      "The piece makes no other mention of porn, but that aspect of the story was amplified and aggregated by other outlets including TMZ, which ran a story and accompanying video headlined, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.\u201d",
      "The suit says the video segment \u201cfalsely framed the Marubo Tribe as having descended into moral collapse.\u201d",
      "Messages seeking comment from TMZ and Yahoo were not immediately answered.",
      "The misperceptions brought on by the aggregation and repackaging of the story led the Times to publish a follow-up.",
      "\u201cThe Marubo people are not addicted to pornography,\u201d Nicas wrote in the the second story. \u201cThere was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times\u2019s article.\u201d",
      "That did not satisfy the tribe, which says in the lawsuit that it \u201cfailed to acknowledge the role the NYT itself played in fueling the defamatory narrative. Rather than issuing a retraction or apology, the follow-up downplayed the original article\u2019s emphasis on pornography by shifting blame to third-party aggregators.\u201d",
      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit says that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \"barely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.",
      "The lawsuit was first reported by Courthouse News.",
      "The plaintiffs also include community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian journalist and sociologist Flora Dutra, both of whom appeared in the story.",
      "Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.",
      "They cited the TMZ video, which shows them setting up antennas for the connection, as creating the \"unmistakable impression\u201d that the two \u201chad introduced harmful, sexually explicit material into the community and facilitated the alleged moral and social decay.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit seeks at least $180 million, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.",
      "\u201cThe fallout from the publication was not limited to public perception,\u201d the suit says, \u201cit destroyed lives, institutions, and culturally significant projects.\u201d",

The site noted that some could be U.S. citizens or green card holders who wouldn\u2019t need one of the international visas at issue in an escalating fight premised by the administration's assertions that the school failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.",

      "\u201cThey said, \u2018No, you have to use it like this or do it in your trousers,\u2019\u201d Khan Suri recalled of the trip, taking him to a Louisiana detention center. \u201cThey were behaving as if we were animals.\u201d",
      "Khan Suri, 41, was released on bond last week as his lawsuit against the U.S.'s deportation case continues. In an interview with The Associated Press, he spoke Thursday of a cramped cell, crowded with other detainees, where he waited anxiously, fearful about what would happen next.",

      "Yet, because of his comments, he said U.S. authorities treated him as if he had committed a high-level crime. Fellow inmates said his red uniform was reserved for the most dangerous offenders.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2019No, I\u2019m just a university teacher. I did nothing,\u201d Khan Suri recalled.",
      "Still, there were rays of hope. He said more than a hundred people from the Georgetown community wrote letters on his behalf to the federal judge overseeing his case, including some who are Jewish.",
      "A crowd also greeted him when he arrived back in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "\u201cHindus, Jews, Christians, Muslims \u2014 everyone together,\u201d said Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow who studies religion, peace and violence. \u201cThat is the reality I want to live with. That\u2019s the reality I want to die for. Those people together.\u201d",

      "Saleh is a Palestinian American whose father worked with the Hamas-backed Gazan government in the early 2000s, but before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Khan Suri's attorneys have said. They also said he barely knew his father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef.",
      "Khan Suri\u2019s attorneys said he wouldn't comment on Yousef during Thursday\u2019s interview, which mostly covered his arrest and time in custody. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Khan Suri's statements.",
      "Khan Suri said he was arrested just after he taught his weekly class on minority rights and the majority. Masked police in plain clothes pulled up in an unmarked car outside his suburban Washington home.",
      "They showed no documents, he said. Other than saying his visa was being revoked, they refused to explain the reason for his arrest, which he described it as a \u201ckidnapping.\"",
      "\u201cThis is not some authoritarian regime,\u201d Khan Suri said. \u201cI was not in Russia or North Korea. I was in the best place in the world. So, I was shocked.\u201d",
      "As police whisked him away, Khan Suri realized they wanted to deport him.",
      "The \u201cdehumanizing procedures\u201d came next: A finger scan, a DNA cotton swab and chains binding his wrists, waist and ankles, he said. They also said he could talk to his wife at a detention center in Virginia, but \u201cthat never happened.\"",
      "He said he slept on a floor without a blanket and used a toilet monitored by a camera. The next day, he said he and other detainees were placed in a van, which soon rolled up to an airplane.",
      "\u201cI asked them where I am going now? Nobody would reply anything,\u201d Khan Suri said. \u201cThey just pushed us in.\u201d",
      "He said the bathroom situation did not get better at a federal detention center in Louisiana, where Khan Suri was taken next. It lacked a privacy barrier and was also watched by a camera.",
      "He was finally able to call his wife, but he said she couldn't hear him. Khan Suri said he was \u201cextremely terrified,\u201d thinking that someone was making his family not reply.",
      "He was not able to speak to a lawyer, while fellow inmates said everyone there is deported within three days, Khan Suri said.",
      "\u201cI was crying from inside, 'How can this be happening?\" he said. \u201cA few hours back, I was in Georgetown teaching my students, talking about peace and conflict analysis.\u201d",
      "Khan Suri said his first seven or eight days of captivity were the same: \u201cSame terror. Same fear. Same uncertainty. Same mockery of rule of law. Same mockery of due process.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was going more and more deeper, reaching to my abyss,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I was discovering that the abyss also has more and more depth.\u201d",
      "But he was still praying five times a day, uncertain which direction Mecca was.",
      "\u201cI was very strong like that, that God will help me. American Constitution will help me. American people will help me,\u201d he said.",
      "Afterward, Khan Suri was transferred to a detention facility in Texas, where he said he slept on the floor of a crowded cell for the first two weeks. Eventually, he got his own cot.",
      "And, finally, he was allowed to speak to his attorneys, which he said led to a change in treatment. Khan Suri, who is Muslim, soon received a Quran and then a prayer rug. As for the rug, he rolled it up like it was his young son.",
      "\u201cMy eyes would become wet, and I would give that blanket a hug as my son so that this hug should reach him,\u201d Khan Suri said. \u201cAnd when I came back, he told me the same, that he was hugging a pillow.\u201d",

      "The men who were placed on a deportation flight headed for the chaotic nation of South Sudan were originally from countries as far away as Vietnam",
      "The foreign men convicted of crimes who were placed on a deportation flight headed for the chaotic nation of South Sudan were originally from countries as far away as Vietnam. They had lived in various places from California to Iowa, Nebraska to Florida, with one serving a sentence of nearly 30 years.",
      "They were accused and convicted of crimes ranging from murder, to rape, robbery and assault.",
      "Despite their criminal records, a federal judge says the White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries, adding these eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger.",
      "Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston ordered a new set of interviews with the migrants, either back in the U.S. or abroad. Trump administration officials accused \u201cactivist judges\u201d of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.",
      "\u201cNo country on Earth wanted to accept them because their crimes are so uniquely monstrous and barbaric,\u201d said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "At least one of the victim's family members has come out to oppose the way the deportation was conducted and the fact that her family wasn't notified, while saying she had long hoped the man would leave the United States.",
      "These are the migrants who were part of the deportation flight.",
      "The only man from South Sudan on the flight was 33-year-old Dian Peter Domach. He was convicted in 2013 of robbery, for which he was sentenced to 8 to 14 years in prison; and of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person, for which he was sentenced to 6 to 10 years. Those sentences were to be served one after the other. The Department of Homeland Security said Domach was also convicted of driving under the influence.",
      "While in prison, he was convicted of \u201cassault by a confined person\u201d and sentenced to an additional 18 to 20 months. According to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, Domach was released on \u201cdiscretionary parole\u201d on May 2 and arrested by immigration authorities six days later.",
      "Records said he represented himself on appeal and in the most recent prison assault case.",
      "One of the two deportees with life sentences is 48-year-old Thongxay Nilakout from Laos. He was convicted of killing a German woman and wounding her husband in 1994 when he was 17. The couple was visiting a popular tourist lookout east of Los Angeles during a trip to see their daughter.",
      "Nilakout was sentenced to life in prison but was released in 2023 after his case was reviewed following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said mandatory life sentences for minors were unconstitutional. Nilakout was ordered removed to Laos by an immigration judge in 2023 and waived appeal, court records show.",
      "The couple's daughter, Birte Pfleger, is now a history professor at California State University, Los Angeles. She called it a \u201creal moral dilemma,\" explaining she is not happy with the way the deportation was conducted.",
      "\u201cNo matter which way you slice it, you cannot violate people\u2019s due process. That\u2019s a fundamental constitutional right that has existed for well over 250 years,\u201d she said.",
      "But she hopes the man chooses to return voluntarily to Laos. Pfleger said she filled out forms that she has to be notified of any changes in Nilakout's case, but wasn't notified when the man was arrested by immigration authorities in January or when he was put on the flight.",
      "\u201cHe supposedly had plans for that because he still has some relatives in Laos,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, guess what? Now\u2019s the time. Go call those relatives. Go home. Don't come back.\u201d",
      "Kyaw Mya, a man from Myanmar who lived in Iowa, was convicted of sexually abusing a child under 12 years of age and sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Mya was ordered removed by an immigration judge in 2021, and lost his appeal of that order in 2023, according to a statement from Marcos Charles, an assistant director of field operations with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in a court filing late Thursday. He was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in February.",
      "An attorney for Mya did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.",
      "Nyo Myint, another Burmese deportee, lived in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was accused in 2017 of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old woman with \u201cdiminished mental capacity\u201d who ended up pregnant. The woman's sister said the victim had a mental capacity equal to a 3-year-old and that Myint had told her he was the child's father.",
      "An arrest affidavit filed by the police said Myint admitted to having sex with the woman at least two times, saying he knew her since 2003 and knew she had gone to a school for children with mental disabilities. He admitted he made a mistake and felt it was wrong to have sex with her.",
      "He was given a 12- to 14-year prison sentence in 2020 but released on probation in May 2023. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge that same year and waived appeal, court records show. ICE took custody of Myint in February.",
      "Nathan Sohriakoff remembers defending Myint in the Nebraska case and communicating with him via interpreters. He hadn't heard he was part of the deportee group, which Trump administration officials are calling \u201cbarbaric monsters.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was a small man, very petite. He didn\u2019t speak a word of English and didn\u2019t resist the charges,\u201d Sohriakoff said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember feeling like he was dangerous. My general feeling of him was that he was limited in his ability as well, like cognitively, but not to the degree that I felt he was incompetent.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says the flight included a Vietnamese man. Tuan Thanh Phan was convicted of first-degree murder and second-degree assault and sentenced to 22 years in prison.",
      "An immigration judge ordered Phan removed to Vietnam in 2009, and he waived his appeal, court records show. He was arrested by ICE earlier this month.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says the flight included two men from Cuba: Enrique Arias-Hierro and Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones.",
      "Florida court records show Arias-Hierro, now 46, served 15 years in a state prison after being convicted of robbery, kidnapping and falsely impersonating an officer in 2007. Homeland Security officials say he was also convicted of homicide and armed robbery, but the records in Miami-Dade County did not include that. Arias-Hierro had already been ordered removed to Cuba by an immigration judge back in 1999, and did not file an appeal, court records show.",
      "The attorney who last served as his public defender in 2024 did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. Arias-Hierro was taken by ICE earlier this month.",
      "Immigration officials said in a court filing Thursday that Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones was sentenced to 15 years in prison being convicted of arson in 2008 in Florida.",
      "Additional convictions for drug trafficking, being a felon in possession of a weapon, and possession of drug paraphernalia followed, said Charles, ICE's assistant director of field operations, in a statement filed in court. In 2022, he was convicted of attempted first-degree murder and sentenced to four years in prison, the document shows.",
      "Charles\u2019 declaration did not say if Rodriguez-Quinones was ever seen by an immigration judge. He was arrested by ICE last month.",
      "A Mexican man was also placed on the deportation flight. Immigration officials say Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez was recently \u201cidentified as and admitted to being a member of a criminal organization.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security says Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.",
      "An immigration judge ordered him deported to Mexico in 2005, and Munoz-Gutierrez waived his appeal, court records show.",
      "It was unclear why he would be flown to South Sudan or beyond when Mexico is just south of the United States.",

      "CAMDEN, Del. -- Thousands of chicks found abandoned inside a postal service truck for three days have gone to new homes, according to the Delaware shelter that had cared for them, with the last batch picked up on Thursday morning.",
      "All the surviving birds, estimated as more than 5,000 chickens \u2014 it was too hard to get a specific count \u2014 plus some others like turkeys and quails, were primarily adopted by local families, rescues and farms, according to First State Animal Center and SPCA.",
      "The chicks were part of a 12,000-bird shipment left unattended in a truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. Trapped in high temperatures without food or hydration, thousands died, according to the state Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Postal Service has said it is investigating the \u201cprocess breakdown\u201d that occurred.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving birds had been cared for at an overwhelmed First State Animal Center and SPCA, said John Parana, executive director. As a no-kill operation, the shelter would not take adopters planning to use the birds for meat, Parana said. Some of the adopters took hundreds at a time, hoping for egg-laying hens, while others took them as pets.",
      "Stephanie Bruzdzinski adopted a handful of chicks after her daughter learned about their situation.",
      "\u201cShe was very upset and wanted to help out,\u201d said Bruzdzinski, who was similarly shocked when she heard the news. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like when things aren\u2019t getting taken care of.\u201d",
      "The birds originated from Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery\u2019s weekly bird shipment to clients around the country, and due to biosecurity concerns, the hatchery cannot take the chicks back, a company spokesperson said.",

      "A change in the admissions policy introduced five years ago at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology led to the enrollment of more Black and Hispanic students and faced a court challenge from some parents. The plaintiffs argued it came at the expense of Asian American students, whose numbers at the school dropped.",
      "The investigation comes one day after the office of Virginia's attorney general, Republican Jason Miyares, closed its own investigation, which found the school's policy discriminated against Asian American students. His office referred the case to federal authorities.",

      "The school district said it would review the documents released by the state attorney general.",
      "\u201cThis matter has already been fully litigated,\u201d Fairfax County Public Schools said in a statement. \u201cA federal appellate court determined there was no merit to arguments that the admissions policy for Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology discriminates against any group of students.\u201d",
      "In 2020, the school district revised the admissions policy at Thomas Jefferson by removing a $100 application fee and admissions test and adopting a \u201cholistic review\u201d process.",
      "The first class admitted under the new policy saw an increase in low-income students, English language learners and girls. About 54% of the admitted class were Asian American \u2014 a decline from prior year percentages that ranged from 65% to 75%. The percentage of Black and Hispanic students, who have been underrepresented at the school, also increased.",

Admissions evaluators did not have access to students' name, race or other demographic information.",
      "A district court initially ruled in favor of the parents' group that challenged the policy, but an appeals court later overturned that ruling.",
      "The appeals court noted that while the percentage of Asian American students had declined under the new policy compared to earlier classes, Asian American students outperformed their share of the applicant pool.",
      "The case had been considered a possible next step to challenging admissions practices, after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action and explicit consideration of race in its 2023 ruling against Harvard and the University of North Carolina.

      "When North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong took up an agency budget bill approved by the legislature, he vetoed a couple line items. At least, that was his intention Monday. Instead, he accidentally vetoed $35 million for the state's housing budget.",
      "Now the state is figuring out how to deal with the unusual problem of a mistaken veto.",
      "\u201cI have no recollection of anything like this happening in the 37 years I've been here,\u201d John Bjornson, legislative council director, said Thursday. \u201cSo, yeah, I'd say it's a little extraordinary.\u201d",
      "The governor's staff called his veto of the housing budget in Senate Bill 2014 a markup error. Armstrong's staff met with the legislative council Thursday morning to discuss options.",
      "\"This was an honest mistake, and we will fix it,\u201d a statement from the governor's office read.",
      "Armstrong, a Republican who served three terms in Congress, was elected governor in 2024. The legislative session that adjourned earlier in the month was his first as governor.",
      "In a message accompanying the veto, Armstrong wrote he had intended to veto a $150,000 grant to fund a Native American homelessness liaison position. The budget veto would take effect July 1.",
      "What happens next is largely up to the governor, Bjornson said, but it is likely that the legislature will need to reconvene in Bismarck for a special session. The governor's office said it will call a special session if needed but hopes to \u201cavoid the expense.\u201d",
      "If the legislature overrides the veto, that would include funding for the grant Armstrong had wanted to strike. If the legislature wants to only fund the $35 million housing budget, lawmakers may need to pass a new bill, which could take as long as three days, Bjornson said.",
      "The Legislature has six days available to use of its 80-day session limit, and a special session could open the opportunity to override other vetoes by the governor. The governor vetoed all or parts of four bills this session.",

The judge wrote that the evidence of Smith\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and the DNA evidence did not tip the scales in his favor.",
      "Tennessee executions have been on hold for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "Smith came within minutes of execution in 2022 before he was saved by a surprise reprieve from Republican Gov. Bill Lee. It later turned out the lethal drugs that were going to be used on him had not been properly tested. A subsequent yearlong investigation turned up numerous other problems with Tennessee executions.",
      "The Correction Department issued new guidelines for executions in December. The new execution manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes the requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Smith\u2019s attorney, Amy Harwell, has characterized it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s as if, having been caught breaking their own rules, TDOC decided, \u2018Let\u2019s just not have rules.\u2019\u201d",
      "The new protocols are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Smith and other death row inmates. A trial in that case is set for next January.",

So everybody is truly excited ... They know they're part of history happening right here.\u201d",

And that idea of Dayton being a city of peace really settled in, and we take great pride in that here in the city.\u201d",

The Old Montgomery County Courthouse will host an exhibit called \u201cDayton Around the World,\u201d featuring artifacts and stories celebrating the city's history, which includes being home to the aviation-pioneering Wright brothers.",
      "Gatherings of this magnitude also require security planning. Demonstrators on many sides of the issues could show up to picket or march. The city has spent over $700,000 to rent the fencing and barricades to place around the NATO Village and summit venue downtown, which are closed to the public through Sunday.",
      "Kershner said plans are in place to ensure safety.",
      "\u201cDayton\u2019s well prepared to host events like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a great Dayton Police Department. We\u2019ve worked very closely with Ohio State Highway Patrol, with Homeland Security, with other law enforcement agencies to make sure that everybody\u2019s going to be safe, secure, and well-protected.\u201d",

      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 10:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "FDA advisers are set to meet Thursday to decide on updates for this fall's COVID shots.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",
      "The CDC's recommendations directly impact which vaccinations health insurers are required to cover under the law.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 19:23:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "Rappaport was admitted to Abbott Northwestern in March 2022 and was scheduled for a spleen removal surgery, the lawsuit says. After the doctor recommended the surgery, the suit says he reviewed the risk of procedure with her.",
      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury. The Allina health system also faces similar allegations, as the medical professionals involved in the surgery also owed her a duty of care, documents say.",

While we will not discuss details of a patient's care due to privacy laws, the court filings don't accurately reflect the full picture of the patient's condition or the life-saving medical care provided.

This was not the case for Ms. Rappaport prior to the unnecessary kidney removal. On 5/16/2025, we commenced the lawsuit on Ms. Rappaport's behalf seeking fair compensation for her injuries and the future damages she will incur due to the Defendant's medical malpractice and medical battery.

      "While the researchers were asked to continue working for a few more weeks in the labs they run at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, multiple sources familiar with the situation say their layoff notices have not been revoked.",
      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",

Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",
      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",

      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",

Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",

      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",

      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",

    "summary": "A GOP tax-and-spending bill the House approved Thursday would slash federal Medicaid reimbursement for states that offer health coverage to immigrants without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",

      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 16:50:51 -0400",
    "summary": "House Republican's budget bill would create $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born between January 2025 and January 2029.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration wants to kickstart wealth creation for American children by creating $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",
      "Originally called \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or \"MAGA\" savings accounts, the renamed accounts would be managed by banks or investment firms, and operate like traditional investment accounts.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed \"Trump accounts\" for newborns.",
      "What are they called?",
      "House Republicans on Wednesday submitted an amendment to Mr. Trump's domestic policy bill to ditch the original \"Maga\" acronym and rename the accounts \"Trump accounts,\" after the president himself.",
      "Who would get one?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029 with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program. The U.S. Treasury would set up and fund the accounts.",
      "Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, said automatic enrollment is a key component of the proposed pilot program, given some adults' unfamiliarity with such investment vehicles. Some of the lowest-income families, who could most benefit from the boost, \"often don't know about these kinds of programs. There's a huge awareness gap,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Automatic enrollment is fundamental to improving the likelihood that it reaches the lowest-income families,\" she added.",
      "What would be in a \"Trump account\"?",
      "The government would contribute $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market on their behalf. Families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 a year to a child's account.",
      "Sam Taube, investment expert at personal finance site Nerdwallet, said the proposed \"Trump accounts\" are similar to programs currently offered by a number of states, but the contributions aren't as generous. For instance Colorado's First Step program awards every newborn $100 in a 529 college savings account, plus a match of $500 a year for the first five years of savings, totaling up to $2,500 in gift contributions.",
      "What could the money be spent on?",
      "Accountholders would only be approved to be spend investment funds on prescribed costs, such as a down payment on a home, education-related expenses, or starting a small business. Use of the funds to pay for unapproved expenses would subject accountholders to penalties.",
      "But broadening the scope of approved expenditures would be even more beneficial to many families, Brown noted.",
      "\"When it comes to wealth building, we have to make sure the target sums that kids end up with at 18 are in line with the things we're saying you can use the money for,\" Brown explained.",
      "If lower-income accountholders' families can't contribute the additional $5,000 per year, the sum they would end up with as adults might not cover a down payment, for example.",
      "\"There are lots of different projections around what $1,000 can grow to with different interest rates, but it's not a down payment,\" she said. \"So unless additional contributions come from the community, the federal government or state governments, we're not likely to see these accounts grow to the sums that we're saying are qualified uses.",
      "When could the funds be withdrawn?",
      "Half of the funds could be withdrawn when a child turns 18, at which point the account's gains would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, so long as the money were spent as directed. If the funds were used for other purposes, withdrawals would be taxed as income. A 10% penalty for misspending the money could also apply. Accountholders would have access to their full balances between the ages of 25-30 for approved purposes, and after 30, would be able to withdraw the funds for any purpose.",
      "Brown said she thinks improvements could be made to the way the program is structured, particularly around how account withdrawals are taxed. She noted that the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.",
      "Most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to a January report from Bankrate, making low-earners more likely to need to tap into the funds for surprise costs.",
      "\"They are the most likely to have to withdraw dollars for nonqualified expenses, and in doing so, they [would] receive a tax penalty. So there are ways to exempt emergency expenses, and that would be a fix,\" Brown said.",
      "Otherwise, she said, the upsides to the accounts are limited. \"There are other places you can save money where you won't have that tax penalty if you withdraw the funds early,\" Brown said.",
      "Taube of Nerdwallet noted that the proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable.",
      "\"Although they are advertised as tax-advantaged accounts, the way they work does not seem to be that different from how a taxable brokerage account would work,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That said, \"given the state of saving for children's future expenses in this country, the accounts do seem like they could help at least somewhat,\" Taube said.",

    "summary": "Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation that passed in the lower chamber early Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",

      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",

This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",

      "Stocks are slumping amid signs of slowing consumer spending and investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.",
      "Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, on Wednesday reported weaker sales for the first quarter and warned of a potential downdraft over the rest of the year as Americans react to U.S. tariffs by pulling back on consumption.",
      "The company's sales fell 2.8% to $23.8 billion in the January-March period, down from $24.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, while Target said it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for 2025.",
      "Target \"faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence [and] uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a call with Wall Street analysts.",

      "Target shares fell $5.11 on the day, or 5.2% to $93.01.",
      "Such weakness comes as more companies say that rising economic uncertainty is clouding their financial prospects. Other large retailers, including Walmart, have said they plan to hike prices to offset tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on China and other countries.",
      "\"We continue to feel there's too much complacency about two key (and related) sources of macro risk: tariffs and fiscal policy,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors. \"Despite a de-escalation of trade tensions, tariffs are still quite elevated on an absolute basis, and the full effects of these import taxes haven't been felt yet in the economy.\"",
      "Shrinking corporate sales and profits could eventually shackle job growth, which has remained resilient in recent months, experts note.",

      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

    "summary": "With the Department of Education this month resuming collections on student loans, millions of Americans are at risk of having their wages garnished.",
    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",
      "\"There are legitimate reasons why they can stop wage garnishment from occurring,\" Yu said. \"But I am very worried these notices aren't telling people about the full scope of the relief.\"",
      "Borrowers can also get current on their loans through other methods. For example, consider requesting loan rehabilitation to get out of default by making nine on-time payments in full over a 10-month period.",
      "You can also avoid entering default and having wages garnished through loan consolidation. Essentially, this process replaces your old debt with a new loan that's in good standing and on which you can start making payments. If you're able to repay your loans in full, that's another way to exit default.",

Retail costs are also expected to rise; by 2050, costs passed onto the consumer could double, ICF found.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment as rising demand creates urgent challenges for the grid,\" said Anne Choate, ICF executive vice president for energy, environment and infrastructure in a statement.",
      "The U.S. could struggle with increased electricity demand due to rising temperatures and the growing use of emerging technologies, bearing down on an overloaded system. The report found that in Texas, nearly one-third of the expected increase is attributable to large load sources, such as cryptocurrency mining operations. Data centers, building electrification and semiconductor manufacturing, along with electric vehicles, account for 35% of the projected load through 2040 in 13 mid-Atlantic and Midwest states as well as Washington, D.C.",
      "Electric grid operators across the U.S. have been sounding the alarm in advance of elevated summer temperatures after record-breaking heat last year. The World Meteorological Organization said in its annual\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0that 2024 set a new global\u00a0temperature record, averaging over 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The National Weather Service released a report last week predicting hotter-than-normal temperatures across the United States from June through August.",
      "PJM, one of the country's largest electric grid operators, serving 67 million people in states including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Michigan, warned customers in\u00a0a news release\u00a0that the system will be experience a high peak demand this summer.",
      "\"This outlook at a record peak heat scenario reflects our years-long and mounting concerns as we plan for enough resources to maintain grid reliability,\" said Aftab Khan, PJM's executive vice president of Operations, Planning & Security, in a statement. The operator stressed it had adequate resources to respond to the demand and said it is planning for unusual scenarios and will react to them to \"protect the electricity supply.\"",
      "Electricity costs are also expected to rise and outpace inflation, with experts predicting a jump of 6% in 2025 \u2014 an average of $784 per household for the summer period. That would mark a 12-year record, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Households are not only expected to have to pay higher prices for electricity, they will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-obesity-states/",
    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

      "The largest holder of President Trump's cryptocurrency token is entrepreneur Justin Sun, the billionaire revealed Tuesday \u2014 earning him an invite to a controversial dinner this week hosted by Mr. Trump for his meme coin's biggest backers.",
      "Sun announced he will attend Thursday evening's dinner at Mr. Trump's D.C.-area golf club \u2014 which is open to the 220 largest holders of the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 in a post on X, describing himself as the president's \"TOP fan.\"",
      "\"As the top holder of $TRUMP, I'm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry,\" wrote Sun, who founded the Tron blockchain and faced a securities lawsuit from Biden-era federal regulators.",
      "The meme coin's website lists the largest holder of $TRUMP as somebody with the username \"Sun\" who owns about 1.4 million tokens \u2014 worth around $19 million at Tuesday's trading price.",
      "In addition to the dinner for the top 220 holders of $TRUMP, the president is also hosting an \"Exclusive Reception\" at his club in Northern Virginia for the token's top 25 holders. Sun did not immediately respond when asked by CBS News if he would attend the smaller reception.",
      "What is the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "The meme coin was launched in January, days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. An affiliate of the Trump organization and a firm called Fight Fight Fight LLC control 80% of the coin's total supply.",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions. Like many meme coins, $TRUMP is known for erratic price shifts: Its price peaked at around $75 shortly after its launch, but plummeted to under $8 by early April.",
      "But late last month, the price surged after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced. Buyers spent more than $140 million to buy the $TRUMP coins in hopes of securing an invitation to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Mr. Trump previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" The president and his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and crypto makes up some $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth according to a recent report.",
      "Eric Trump in January called the $TRUMP coin \"the hottest digital meme on earth.\"",
      "The $TRUMP private dinner marketing promotion \u2014 and the president's links to World Liberty \u2014 have raised concerns among government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest.",
      "The Senate on Monday advanced a bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, that would regulate so-called stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. The bill faced some pushback from Democrats who pushed for anti-corruption rules, often citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings.",
      "\"How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun \u2014 a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture \u2014 announces he's getting a private dinner as the President's top crypto buyer,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.",
      "The White House has dismissed criticism that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest, noting his assets are held in a trust managed by his children.",
      "\"The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2013 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Who is Justin Sun?",
      "Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes. He's best known for the Tron blockchain \u2014 and for paying $6.2 million at auction for a banana that artist Maurizio Cattelan duct-taped to a wall, which Sun promptly ate as part of a \"unique artistic experience.\"",
      "Sun says his firm has also invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial.",
      "He was sued by the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" for a crypto token created by his company. The suit also accused his firm of paying celebrities like Lindsey Lohan and Jake Paul to promote the token \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Sun's attorneys have pushed back on the suit.",
      "But earlier this year, the SEC and Sun agreed to pause the lawsuit to \"explore a potential resolution.\" The halt was part of a broader shift by the Trump administration to ease cryptocurrency enforcement.",

    "summary": "It is Harvard's second suit against the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, hours after the Ivy League school challenged a decision by administration officials that targeted its enrollment.",
      "U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed to grant Harvard's request for immediate relief and set a hearing for May 29, during which she will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction in the case. Her order blocks the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "Her brief order said the temporary order is \"justified to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.\"",
      "The judge's intervention came hours after Harvard filed a federal lawsuit over the\u00a0Trump administration's decision to bar it from enrolling foreign students, calling it unconstitutional retaliation for defying the White House's political demands. It is the school's second suit against the Trump administration.",
      "In the lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government's action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard said in its suit.",
      "Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries.",
      "The school had said it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move, which the department announced on Thursday. It accused Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \"anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\" to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the action against Harvard will \"serve as a warning\" to other universities.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on \"its core, legally-protected principles\" over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The threat to Harvard's international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation.",
      "Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.",
      "\"The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,\" Garber said in a statement Friday to member of the Harvard community.",
      "\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he said.",
      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said.",
      "An earlier suit from the university challenged more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration. That suit came after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "The lawsuit, which Burroughs is also overseeing, alleged the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding and claimed that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "China's government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban foreign students from Harvard would harm the United States' international standing. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard's international student population, with 1,203 coming from China in 2024.",
      "Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by the Trump administration's decision. Large portions of the men's rowing and squash and women's soccer and golf rosters list international hometowns on the school's website. Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on Harvard athletic rosters for the 2024-25 seasons had international hometowns.",

      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "summary": "The House GOP campaign arm is targeting Democrats holding politically risky seats for opposing the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\"",
    "story": [
      "The House Republicans' campaign arm is focusing a new advertising campaign on Democrats from politically risky seats who voted against the GOP's sweeping effort to cut taxes and pass Medicaid work requirements, setting the stage for what may prove to be one of the biggest political messaging clashes of next year's midterms.",
      "Republicans in Washington are attempting to use their control of Congress and the White House to put in place major conservative agenda items sought by President Donald Trump and his allies through one massive piece of legislation, titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" The House GOP's narrow passage of Trump's agenda earlier this week has set off a struggle between Republicans and Democrats to sway voters about the impact of the bill that is widely expected to play a large role in the 2026 midterm elections, where control of the House will be decided.",
      "In a statement about the advertising campaign, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said the campaign arm \"will make sure voters don't forget how [House Democrats] betrayed working families.\"",
      "The round of digital advertisements places a particular emphasis on the tax portion of the Trump agenda bill, which continues key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was the centerpiece of his first term in office. Plans show the ads will target\u00a0 25 House Democrats and make the argument that by opposing this week's bill, the Democrats voted \"for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.\" Of those 25 districts, 13 are seats where a Democrat won the House contest while Trump carried the district in the presidential race.",
      "Republicans' best chance at padding their narrow majority next year could come in places that had some of the closest Congressional races in the entire country during the 2024 presidential election, including a California seat where the Democratic candidate ousted a Republican incumbent by less than 200 votes. Other areas closely watched by the GOP that are also the subject of the latest ad campaign include two Democrat-held seats in the red state of Ohio, districts Trump won in the battleground states of North Carolina and Michigan, as well as seats that could prove to be competitive in New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.",
      "Yet while many House Republicans in Washington are cheering the legislation, Democrats see ample political liabilities for their opponents. Democratic leaders view the House as the party's best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington during Trump's presidency, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election and the small number of seats it would likely take to flip control of the chamber.",
      "The GOP's targeting of Medicaid in particular has quickly been seized on by the left as a major campaign issue, as Democrats charge the Republican agenda's changes imperil healthcare for millions of people.",
      "\"America cannot afford the Republican tax scam. Now that vulnerable Republicans are on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026,\" Washington Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, said in a statement earlier this week.",
      "It remains to be seen however what kind of bill can eventually make it to Mr. Trump's desk, given the changes the GOP-led Senate may make once it gets its hands on the legislation.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 11:01:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has overseen a wide-ranging effort to restructure the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday continued to block the Trump administration from moving forward with its plans to lay off thousands of government workers at more than 20 federal agencies, providing federal employees a lifeline as a legal challenge to President Trump's bid to restructure the federal government moves forward.",
      "The preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston covers 21 federal agencies and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and prevents them from implementing reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The judge, who sits on the federal court in San Francisco, also barred agencies from implementing any orders by the Elon Musk-led DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with an executive order signed by President Trump in February that seeks to transform the executive branch. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as AmeriCorps and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "While Illston also granted retrospective relief by ordering federal agencies to rescind any reductions-in-force, or layoffs, issued under the president's February directive and to reinstate government workers who were put on administrative leave, she paused those components of her decision while the administration pursues an appeal.",
      "The Justice Department informed the court on Friday that it will be asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to review Illston's decision.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "She said that the plaintiffs in the case, which are labor unions, nonprofit organizations and local governments, are likely to succeed on their claim that Mr. Trump's executive order usurps Congress's constitutional powers and exceeds his authority.",
      "\"Put simply, in this case, defendants want the court to either declare that nine presidents and twenty-one Congresses did not properly understand the separation of powers, or ignore how the executive branch is implementing large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations. The court can do neither,\" Illston wrote.",
      "Illston had issued a two-week temporary restraining order on May 9 that directed the Trump administration to pause its plans to lay off vast swaths of the federal workforce. That temporary order was set to expire Friday. Her preliminary injunction now extends the initial block on the administration's restructuring of the federal government as the case proceeds.",
      "The Trump administration already asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to allow it to move forward with its reductions-in-force, seeking emergency relief in a request that arose out of Illston's temporary restraining order. The high court has not yet acted on that bid, though the Justice Department will likely ask the Supreme Court to lift Illston's injunction.",
      "Mr. Trump's February executive order directed agencies to make plans to initiate \"large -scale\" reductions in force as part of his initiative to slash the size of the federal government. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts, due March 13 and April 14.",
      "The Trump administration has said in filings that 40 reductions-in-force at 17 agencies were in progress but blocked by Illston's May 9 order. The plans target\u00a0thousands of federal workers, including up to 10,000 at the Department of Health and Human Services, 8,500 at the Energy Department and half of the workforce at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Department of Veterans Affairs has said it intends to slash 83,000 positions.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "Mr. Trump's government-shrinking efforts began shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force led by Musk, and his administration has taken steps to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

      "The Trump administration on Thursday revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students in its escalating battle with the Ivy League school, saying thousands of students must transfer to other schools or leave the country. Harvard filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration, arguing that its action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",

    "summary": "Mothers and relatives of the Venezuelan detainees in CECOT have been communicating about their loved ones in a WhatsApp group.",
    "story": [
      "On May 18, relatives of the Venezuelan migrant detainees in El Salvador's mega prison CECOT, announced to a WhatsApp group the death of Marlene Ramirez, a grandmother who raised one of the men currently detained there, Jonathan Mendoza Ramirez. Her family said she had died of a heart attack, unable to endure the emotional stress of not being able to communicate with her grandson. She could no longer take it, they said.",
      "Since the Trump administration in March removed a group of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members to El Salvador for indefinite detention, a WhatsApp virtual community has come into being, made up largely of mothers of the detainees. The group grew one by one, as the mothers found out about their sons' whereabouts, largely from videos posted on social media by the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. The videos showed the Venezuelan men arriving from the U.S. in shackles, being frog-marched off the plane and into CECOT. Inside the prison, they were forced to kneel as their heads were shaved by guards.",
      "\"I can't recount these videos or else I fall into a serious depression,\" said Jetzy Arteaga, the creator of the WhatsApp group. Her son, Carlos Ca\u00f1izalez Arteaga, is one of the Venezuelan migrants\u00a0transferred to CECOT in March. \"I try to block them, so that I can go on about my day, but only a mother in this situation can understand why these images hurt so much.\" On days when she can't keep the images out of her thoughts, Arteaga says she can't get out of bed and turns to other mothers in the group chat.",
      "\"When one of us is down, we go to their house, run their errands and pick up their other kids from school,\" says Arteaga. \"They're all over Venezuela, and I understand that today, it might be them needing help, but tomorrow it might be me in the hospital.\"",
      "Arteaga created the group to communicate with other mothers because she says she needed answers. \"I was in a state of disbelief, and I was waiting for the U.S. government to say my son was transferred by mistake,\" said Arteaga. \"The U.S. is a country that follows their laws, and when their investigation concludes my son is not a gang member, they'll release him.\"",
      "Records that prove his lack of criminal gang activity in Venezuela, however, have not led to Carlos' release. The group says it has grown and now includes relatives of 170 of the migrant men detained in El Salvador.",
      "\"The first thing I do every morning is check the group chat, and we ask for updates and prayers,\" said Analia Burbano, whose nephew Victor Andres Ortega Burbano, is being held in CECOT. She says she constantly scrolls through social media to see if there are any updates or photos of her nephew in prison.",
      "Burbano says she is now speaking on behalf of her nephew because his mother is emotionally and physically unable to do so. \"Ever since she saw the video of Victor at CECOT, she fell into a depression, does not get up from bed, does not eat and cries every day,\" said Burbano. \"She is very frail.\"",
      "Burbano says her nephew's arrest and transfer came as a surprise, since Ortega had been granted Temporary Protected Status that allowed him to legally work in the U.S. According to immigration documents reviewed by CBS News, Ortega's TPS was approved for June 2024 through last month, in April.",
      "The group frequently makes trips to Miramar, Venezuela, to pressure officials to demand the release and deportation of the men back to their country. The chat serves as a venue to plan the next protest or opportunity to publicize the men's plight at events like those held by the United Nations.",
      "\"We all have our ups and downs, but through this process, we make sure that none of us let the negative thoughts linger for long,\" said Anyi Yohana Casares Jimenez, mother of Jason Alfredo Silva Casares. On March 13, Jimenez says she received the last call from her son, desperately asking her to send over documents proving he didn't have a criminal record in Venezuela. She never heard from him again.",
      "Jason showed up at the U.S. southern border in August 2024 after receiving an appointment through the CBP One app, but remained in detention because immigration agents were suspicious of his crown tattoo, according to his mother. \"There's not a day that I don't search social media for any new videos of him inside CECOT.\"",
      "The three mothers all claim their sons are not part of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, but they do fault the men's tattoos for causing their imprisonment.",
      "\"It was the argument I always had with my son,\" said Arteaga. \"I always asked what his need for a tattoo was.\" Her son tattooed his mother's name \"Jetzy\" on his wrist, a tattoo that now serves as evidence of gang affiliation, according to court documents.",
      "It's now been more than two months since these men were taken to El Salvador and the U.S. government continues to deport anyone who is in the country illegally after President Trump promised to deport \"the worst of the worst\".",

      "Peter Wang, a member of this year's West Point class, was just 15 years old when he was among the 17 killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator for the state of Florida at the time of the shooting, told CBS News the tributes to Peter were a \"solemn recognition of [his] bravery and heroism on that horrific day. Duty, honor, and country are key pillars of West Point cadets, and it's clear Peter personified these principles.\"",
      "He was shot 13 times, first in the foot, then twice more in the thigh. A round tore through his torso. His arms absorbed five more bullets. The final shots\u2014four in total\u2014were to his head, according to Wendolyn Sneed, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy and testified at the shooter's sentencing hearing.",
      "Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, now a U.S. senator, authorized the Florida National Guard to honor Peter with a military funeral. Hundreds assembled in South Florida to pay their respects, with attendees spanning generations and backgrounds.",
      "Junior ROTC cadets from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and other South Florida schools stood saluting in uniform, joined by military veterans and local residents. The gathering reflected the deep impact Peter had on both his peers and the wider community.",
      "An American flag was draped over Peter's casket as \"Taps\" echoed through the air and salutes rose from all corners of the crowd. Among them were veterans with lined faces, uniformed service members, and first responders in dress attire. But it was the youngest among them\u2014fellow Junior ROTC cadets in crisp uniforms\u2014who stood most still.",
      "For his actions, Peter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army, the highest award given to Army JROTC and ROTC cadets whose performance \"involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.\" Junior ROTC cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, who were also killed during the shooting, also received the medal.",
      "West Point granted Peter honorary admission to the class of 2025, which is now preparing to take their commission as second lieutenants and potentially lead soldiers into battle.",

      "Lawyers and advocates this week reported arrests of migrants outside of immigration courthouses across the U.S., saying teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had detained individuals whose cases in front of immigration judges had just been terminated at the request of the government.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News that ICE is conducting an operation to expedite the deportation of migrants with court hearings scheduled in the near future. It's the latest step taken by the Trump administration to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests across the country and fulfill what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in American history.",
      "The operation involves ICE prosecutors asking immigration judges to terminate the court cases of certain migrants, so agents at the agency can instead arrest those individuals and place them in a more rapid deportation process known as \"expedited removal,\" the officials said.",
      "Unlike immigration court proceedings, which can take years to complete due to a massive backlog of 4 million pending cases, the expedited removal process allows officials to more quickly deport migrants, if their cases satisfy certain conditions.",
      "Migrants who lack proper documents and can't prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years are eligible to be deported under expedited removal, without a court hearing.",
      "Historically, officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks. But the Trump administration vastly expanded its scope soon after taking office.",
      "Expedited removal can also be applied to unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. with the government's permission at legal entry points, and there's no two-year entry limit for those cases. That would place the nearly 1 million migrants who entered the U.S. under a Biden administration program known as CBP One at risk of being targeted by the new ICE operation.",
      "While those placed in expedited removal can be deported without a hearing in immigration court, they are entitled to an interview with an asylum officer if they say they are afraid of being persecuted in their home country. If they pass those screenings, they get a chance to plead their case in immigration court.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin faulted the Biden administration for releasing many migrants with notices to appear in immigration court, instead of trying to deport them quickly through expedited removal.",
      "\"ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Leandro Ferrer, an immigration lawyer based in Phoenix, Arizona, said his clients, two Cuban migrants, appear to have been swept up in the ICE operation when they showed up to their immigration court hearing on Tuesday.",
      "\"There was a sense of relief when the government prosecutors moved to dismiss the removal proceedings,\" Ferrer recounted. \"This has always been, historically, a result that is highly sought after and either we try to win a case on the merits of an application or we try to dismiss the removal proceedings.\"",
      "But to his shock and dismay, Ferrer said ICE agents arrested his clients immediately after they left the courtroom.",
      "\"They did not provide identification, they did not have an arrest warrant, they did not make any attempt to establish whether or not they had committed a crime,\" Ferrer added. \"They just went in and took them.\"",
      "Ferrer said his Cuban clients entered the U.S. in 2022, after showing up to a legal entry point along the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to request asylum.",
      "Even amid ICE's efforts to arrest some migrants after they show up to court, immigration lawyers said they are still strongly advising their clients against missing their hearings, as failure to do so could be grounds for judges to issue a deportation order.",
      "The ICE arrests at immigration courts were reported across the country in several cities with large immigrant populations, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Miami.",
      "\"I began getting calls from family members of those getting arrested asking for help,\" said Antonio Ramos, a Miami-based immigration lawyer, adding that the phone calls began on Monday.",
      "Ramos said he's trying to make preparations for his clients who have upcoming court hearings.",
      "\"They're going to come to my office first, we are going to take them to court and we are not going to leave them alone for one second in the building,\" he said.",
      "\"People need to consult with an attorney before going to court, somebody that can take a look at the case, evaluate options and not a notary,\" Ramos added.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Data shows the turnaround in military recruitment began under Biden almost two years ago, and enlistments still lag behind pre-pandemic highs.",
    "story": [
      "Ahead of Memorial Day, President Trump has repeatedly taken credit for an upswing in military recruitment, claiming almost no one wanted to join the military before news of his reelection.",
      "\"After years of military recruiting shortfalls, enlistments in the U.S. armed forces are now the highest in 30 years because there is such an incredible spirit in the United States of America,\" the president said last week in Riyadh.",
      "In reality, military records show enlistments began rebounding from a pandemic slump long before Election Day. While numbers have continued to rise under Mr. Trump, experts say the so-called \"Trump Bump\"\u2014a term used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2014 is more likely the result of recruitment reforms introduced during former President Joe Biden's term.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exaggerated the scale of the recovery, claiming enlistments have hit modern highs. But public data shows the military is still attracting fewer recruits than it did earlier this decade.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that military recruitment reached 30-year records",
      "Asked for comment on the source of the defense secretary and president's claims, a White House official and the Defense Department both pointed to a\u00a0statement\u00a0by chief Pentagon spokesperson and senior adviser Sean Parnell. \"Since Nov. 5, 2024, the U.S. military has seen the highest recruiting percentage of mission achieved in 30 years,\" Parnell said in April.",
      "Publicly available reports from the Defense Department confirm recruiters are currently meeting their goals for the year, but its monthly reports \u2014 only published online since 2016 \u2014 also show the services frequently adjust annual targets, making historical comparisons less meaningful.",
      "For example, after falling short of their goals in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 amid a tight job market, the Army cut its goal from 65,000 to 55,000 active-duty soldiers for the fiscal year 2024. After meeting that benchmark, it's aiming for 61,000 recruits this year. These shifting goal posts complicate claims of record performance.",
      "When measured by total recruits \u2014 the metric Mr. Trump appeared to explicitly reference \u2014 active military enlistments have risen year over year but remain below recent peaks.",
      "In March, the most recent month available, around 13,000 new people enlisted, an increase of nearly 50% over the prior year, but below the 15,000 recorded in March 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term. The figure includes all branches of the military except for the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The highest monthly figure under Mr. Trump second term so far was in January\u2014his inauguration month\u2014when 15,597 recruits received basic training dates. That still trails\u00a0 the 16,800 recorded in January 2018 and 20,000 in August 2024 under Biden.",
      "Recruitment could surpass pre-pandemic levels by the end of fiscal 2025 in September, but it's too early to tell.",
      "And despite recent gains, enlistments remain well below levels achieved three decades ago. In 1990, over 220,000 enlisted in the active military. Those numbers declined after the end of the Cold War and haven't returned to that level, according to historic Defense Department data.",
      "Trump's false claim that recruitment fell to record lows during President Biden's last year",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed military enlistments fell to record lows during Biden's last year in office.",
      "\"Just about a year ago, it was a big story, front page of every paper all over the world, that nobody wanted to enlist in our military,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "That's false. Defense\u00a0data shows military recruitment began to recover after COVID-era declines in fiscal year 2023 and continued to grow in 2024. That year, 146,473 people signed active-duty contracts\u2014about 12,000 more than the previous year.",
      "Mr. Trump has further suggested enlistment was at a record low right before news of his election. In fact, 10,993 people enlisted in October 2024, the last full month before Election Day, a 60% increase over the same month in 2023.",
      "Experts say recruitment reforms explain why recruitment has ticked up, despite longterm challenges",
      "Experts who study military enlistment say the continued improvements have more to do with changes in recruitment strategy and compensation than the change in commander-in-chief.",
      "Katherine Kuzminski of the Center for a New American Security credits Biden-era programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course launched in 2022 and the Navy's Future Sailor Prep Course launched in 2023 for helping candidates struggling with enlistment requirements. In 2024, about 25% of the Army's enlistments came through a prep course.",
      "\"It's harder to convince someone to be interested in military service than it is to train them to a standard,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Defense statistics show over 70% of American youths don't meet qualifications for military service because of rising rates of obesity, drug use, mental health issues, and difficulties meeting educational standards.",
      "Polls show interest in service has also declined in the last decade, and defense representatives have cited flagging trust in institutions, a shrinking population of veterans who serve as models of service, and the number of job options in the private sector, depending on the strength of the economy.",
      "To better compete with private sector offers, Congress approved a 14.5% pay increase for junior enlisted troops last December that took effect this year.",
      "\"It would benefit the DoD to publicly also recognize that they've made quite a few adjustments to the recruiting enterprise instead of the perception that's coming out that it's driven solely by partisan politics,\" Kuzminski said, \"Because I don't think that for most American youth that's the driving factor for their joining the military.\"",

    "summary": "A GOP tax-and-spending bill the House approved Thursday would slash federal Medicaid reimbursement for states that offer health coverage to immigrants without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

She was picked up by family friends at an ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, and will return to Dalton, Georgia \u2014 where she lives with her family \u2014 in the overnight hours, Arias Cristobal's mother said. Her mother said she was able to see Arias Cristobal on FaceTime.",
      "Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 4, had been in ICE custody starting in early May, when she was stopped by local police in Dalton over allegations that she had made an improper turn while driving.",
      "She was charged with driving without a license and making an improper turn and booked into the county jail in Dalton. ICE then took custody of Arias Cristobal, who is in the U.S. illegally, at the county jail, which has an agreement to work with federal immigration authorities.",
      "She had been held at the ICE detention facility in Lumpkin since then. Initially, that facility was also housing her father, who had been taken into ICE custody in April, also after a traffic stop. But he was granted bond last week and released.",
      "Though she was released from detention, Arias Cristobal will continue to face deportation to Mexico, as ICE has started a deportation case against her in immigration court. The Department of Homeland Security has previously said she and her father should face \"consequences\" for being in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Given her time in the U.S. and lack of a criminal record, local community members, including the Republican lawmaker representing Dalton in the Georgia legislature, expressed support for Arias Cristobal and called for her release. Community outrage intensified once Dalton authorities dismissed the traffic charges against Arias Cristobal after revealing she had been mistakenly stopped by the police officer who arrested her.",
      "Dustin Baxter, Arias Cristobal's immigration attorney, said an immigration judge on Wednesday granted his client a $1,500 bond, the lowest amount allowed by law.",
      "\"The judge had reviewed Ximena's case in detail and determined that Ximena is in fact not a flight risk or a danger to the community in the least,\" Baxter said. \"The Department of Homeland Security indicated that it would not appeal the judge's decision.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, it would've been unlikely for someone like Arias Cristobal \u2014 an undocumented immigrant without a criminal history who came to the U.S. as a young child \u2014 to be arrested by ICE.",
      "But as part of its sweeping immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has vastly broadened who ICE officers can target for arrest and deportation, revoking Biden-era policies that generally ensured the agency would only target serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals in the country illegally.",

      "These horse-drawn funerals were suspended by the Army in May 2023 following the deaths of two of the horses within a 96-hour period back in February 2022, prompting an Army investigation.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, other horses pulling the caissons were also suffering painful muscle and tendon injuries. At the time, the Army said that 27 Arlington horses were\u00a0sent to multiple rehabilitation facilities, and the horses were replaced with hearses.",
      "The horses were performing up to eight funerals a day, in all weather, and pulling wagons that weighed more than a ton.",
      "Most of those horses are retired now, replaced by dozens of new ones.",

      "A career diplomat, Brink was confirmed by the Senate as ambassador to Kyiv shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and stayed on during the early months of the Trump administration.",
      "In April, CBS reported that Brink intended to resign her post as ambassador due to an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including USAID layoffs. Brink had been serving in a war zone far from her family since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-maha-report-childhood-chronic-disease/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:11:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The \"Make America Healthy Again\" report outlines what it says are four leading drivers of childhood disease, but it is facing criticism from some health officials.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's \"Make America Healthy Again\" or \"MAHA\" commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has published its first report on what it says are four leading drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"The report is the product of a consensual process, and it represents a collaborative effort of all the agencies and the White House. And it represents a consensus that is probably the strongest and most radical consensus by a government agency in history about the state of America's health,\" Kennedy told reporters in a call ahead of its release.",
      "Thursday's release is the first in a process laid out by President Trump's executive order in February. By August, the commission is due to follow up with a policy strategy to address the findings raised in this report. Kennedy called the report a \"milestone.\"",
      "\"MAHA's become hot,\" Mr. Trump told a roundtable that included Kennedy and other top administration officials at the White House on Thursday.",
      "The \"chronic disease crisis\" in children is described in the report as growing rates of a number of issues including childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, cancer, allergies and autoimmune disorders.",
      "\"More than 40% of American children now have at least one chronic health condition,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday. \"Since the 1970s, rates of childhood cancer have soared, in many cases, by nearly 50%. ... In the 1960s, less than 5% of the children were obese, now over 20% are obese. ... Think of this one, this is the one that gets me every time, and it seems to be getting worse \u2014 just a few decades ago, one in 10,000 children had autism. Today it's 1 in 31.\"",
      "Medical experts attribute much of the increase in autism to better and more widespread testing and diagnostics.",
      "Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that the Trump administration was not seeking \"a European, mandate-driven regulatory system that stifles growth\" as a result of the process.",
      "\"It will happen through a renewed focus on improved science throughout the federal government and our partners. And through unleashing private sector innovation to produce better solutions for our children,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials criticized the report, which they said misrepresented several facts and left out other well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"They're looking for specific causes and silver bullets to draw attention to. However, prevention is all about making it easier for people to make healthy choices,\" said one current federal health official in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "What does the MAHA report say is causing childhood chronic disease?",
      "The wide-ranging report is organized around four topics that it describes as the \"potential drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic disease that present the clearest opportunities for progress\":",
      "Poor diet, driven primarily by ultra-processed foods",
      "Cumulative exposure to chemicals like food additives and pesticides",
      "Lack of physical activity and chronic stress",
      "\"Overmedicalization\" with too many prescriptions and vaccines",
      "These largely reflect many of the themes that Kennedy has long spoken about, including as a longshot presidential candidate last year and as the head of the nation's public health agencies in recent months.",
      "\"It is very strong, it's very frank, and it is a clarion call to do something with utmost urgency to end this crisis. And that's what we wanted,\" Kennedy said of the report.",
      "For example, under the heading of ultra-processed foods, the report echoes Kennedy's criticism of the shift from using \"minimally processed animal-based sources like butter and lard\" to seed oils like corn and canola. And it takes aim at the federal dietary guidelines process, which is due to release a major update later this year.",
      "Others reflect past Kennedy priorities that stop short of his previous calls. For example, the report criticizes the \"corporate capture of media\" through advertising campaigns paid for by drugmakers, but does not call for a ban as he did in the past, acknowledging the pharmaceutical industry \"has the First Amendment right to have these\" ads.",
      "Some parts of the report mirror public health advice championed under the Biden administration, like around the \"epidemic of loneliness and isolation,\" which then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in 2023 was driven by factors like social media and technology.",
      "It also often points to other countries as examples of how things could be done better. A section criticizing U.S. school nutrition programs cites examples from France, Japan and Nordic countries that prepare meals using healthier ingredients.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about pesticides?",
      "The report warns that no \"country in the world has fully accounted for the fact that children are often exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals,\" saying that evaluations of chemicals individually may be neglecting the \"cumulative burdens\" of multiple exposures.",
      "Pesticides are named as a potential risk to be studied alongside a list that includes PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, electromagnetic radiation and chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "\"For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances,\" the report says.",
      "Kennedy has previously spoken out vocally against glyphosate, dating back to court battles with the manufacturer of the Roundup pesticide made from the chemical. That had worried some Republicans and the agriculture industry ahead of the report's release.",
      "The report says that an updated government assessment of common herbicides will be released in 2026 and criticizes pesticide manufacturers for having \"spent billions on research initiatives\" that may have biased studies on the topic.",
      "But the report also pledges to support U.S. farmers, acknowledging that \"precipitous changes in agriculture practices could have an adverse impact\" on the food supply and says that past federal reviews of herbicides \"did not establish a direct link\" to bad health outcomes.",
      "\"We know that the American food system is the safest in the world. It is the safest, most reliable, most robust in the world. But now we talk about how to make it even better and healthier,\" said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.",
      "The National Corn Growers Association said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the report, saying it was \"filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides\" like atrazine and glyphosate that have been vetted by the EPA.",
      "\"If the administration's goal is to bring more efficiency to government, then why is the secretary of Health and Human Services duplicating efforts by raising questions about pesticides that have been answered repeatedly through research and reviews by federal regulatory bodies,\" the group said in a statement after the report's release.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about vaccines and medications?",
      "The report lists a number of medications that it says raise \"important questions\" about its long-term impact for use on children. The list includes antidepressants, stimulant medications for ADHD, weight loss drugs, antibiotics and acid suppressants.",
      "\"Increasingly common, these popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs with complicated metabolic effects lack neurodevelopmental and other long term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development,\" the report says of GLP-1 agonist medications.",
      "It calls out the \"growth of the childhood vaccine schedule,\" which Kennedy has long denounced, often with misleading claims about how vaccines were not sufficiently vetted for safety and efficacy.",
      "\"The number of vaccinations on the American vaccine schedule exceeds the number of vaccinations on many European schedules, including Denmark, which has nearly half as many,\" the report says.",
      "The report also reiterates Kennedy's criticism of the CDC's vaccine safety monitoring efforts, like in the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System and Vaccine Safety Datalink, as well as the federal approach to compensating childhood vaccine injury.",
      "It also criticizes groups like the American Medical Association for efforts to address disinformation about vaccines, saying it \"undermines the open dialogue essential to protecting and improving children's health.\"",
      "Kennedy's approach to vaccines has put him at odds with groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has urged him to do more to foster confidence in the \"rigorous safety system\" for vaccines needed to protect children.",
      "\"FDA and the CDC work together to ensure that years of vaccine clinical trials and safety studies are exhaustively examined, with rigorous, respected, and accepted scientific evidence,\" the group said in a letter in March.",
      "What does the MAHA report get wrong?",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials raised a number of issues with the report, which they said misstated several facts and left out already well-documented drivers known to be causing chronic disease in children that health authorities are already working to address.",
      "Those efforts, they warned, such as work to avert lead poisoning in children, are now under-resourced in the wake of massive layoffs and further proposed budget cuts.",
      "\"This document makes it seem like we don't know what makes people sick,\" one federal health official said in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Two officials pointed out maternal health and preterm birth was left out of the report, which is known to lead to a number of health problems and can be prevented through steps like quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol and getting early prenatal care. Smoking, and the need for broader efforts to prevent youth use of nicotine products, was also not mentioned in the report.",
      "Multiple officials said that scientific research and federal data had been selectively misrepresented in the report.",
      "One official pointed out that what the report highlights as a dramatic rise in childhood cancer ignores improvements in early diagnosis driving the higher rates, as well as declines in deaths.",
      "Another section of the report criticizes the federal dietary guidelines for focusing on limiting sodium instead of focusing on minimizing ultra-processed foods, which a former top FDA official said was \"very puzzling.\"",
      "\"Reducing sodium in the diet is likely the most impactful step they could take to reduce chronic disease risk, and they ignore the totality of the science, including large randomized trials of salt interventions and salt substitutes, that demonstrate important reductions in chronic diseases,\" Dr. Susan Mayne, the FDA's former top nutrition official, said in an email.",

      "The House passed President Trump's\u00a0domestic policy bill, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, by just one vote in the early morning hours Thursday after an all-night session.",
      "The vote was that close in part because Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican who would've voted to support it, was asleep at the time, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "\"Andrew Garbarino did not make it in time. He fell asleep in the back. No kidding, I know. I'm going to just strangle him, but then, he's my dear friend,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a press conference.",
      "Garbarino, who represents New York's 2nd District on Long Island,   did not deny being asleep.",
      "\"I am proud to have been the leading voice on Long Island during negotiations on this key reconciliation bill. I fought to lift the cap on SALT and ensure hardworking Long Island families see the benefits of this important legislation. I was moments away from the House floor, to vote 'yes,' when the vote was closed. While I am frustrated that the vote was closed before I was able to cast my vote, I am proud of the work we accomplished to deliver huge results for Long Island,\" Garbarino said in a statement.",
      "As part of the bill, the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, would be lifted from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000. The issue was a key part of negotiations, with blue-state Republicans like Garbarino pressing for a hike to the cap, which was put in place during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Republican Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona also didn't vote on the bill. Johnson said he \"was going to vote and slipped his card in right at the last minute.\"",
      "The measure passed the house in a 215-214 vote. Every Democrat opposed it, while two Republicans voted no and a third voted present.",
      "\"It was really 217, okay?\" Johnson joked after the vote, citing Schweikert and Garbarino.",
      "Johnson praised Garbarino on social media Thursday, saying he \"played an essential role in negotiations ... and is a primary reason we were able to secure the deal which allowed us to pass our nation-shaping legislation this morning. Andrew is highly regarded by me and all our Members as one of the most trusted, reliable, and talented colleagues in the House, and if it were not for his unique contributions and tireless efforts, we simply would not have achieved what we have in this Congress.\"",

    "summary": "Emails show Kent pressed senior intelligence analysts to amend assessment of links between Venezuelan government and Tren de Aragua gang.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to head the National Counterterrorism Center is under fresh scrutiny as emails show he pressed senior intelligence analysts to amend an assessment of links between the Venezuelan government and the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua, known as TDA, to align the assessment more closely with Trump administration policies and to include references critical of Biden-era immigration programs.",
      "Emails obtained by CBS News show Joe Kent, who currently serves as chief of staff to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, asked for a \"re writing\" of a memorandum on the topic authored by the National Intelligence Council, a team of experts within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that produces high-level analytic assessments for use by policymakers.",
      "After CBS contacted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for comment, a spokesperson offered to share a selection of Kent's declassified, partially redacted email exchanges if they were published in their entirety. The ODNI file was labeled, \"Approved for public release by ODNI on 16 May 2025.\" It is not clear how exhaustive or reflective of the entirety of deliberations about the assessment the email selection released by ODNI is.",
      "Read the email exchanges released by the ODNI here:\u00a0ODNI file 1\u00a0and ODNI file 2.",
      "On Thursday, Kent also personally posted a statement on X defending his actions, writing, \"I'm honored to do my part.\"",
      "The final memorandum, dated April 7, asserts that the Maduro regime in Venezuela \"probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.\" The assessment was later declassified and publicly released on May 5, following a Freedom of Information Act request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.",
      "The question of whether Venezuela's government controls TDA has been at the center of judicial disputes surrounding the Trump administration's ability to deport suspected gang members under the seldom used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. President Trump invoked the act in a March proclamation, effectively designating suspected gang members as wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "Soon after the proclamation was signed, the administration used the act to remove 137 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "\"I have been meaning to come chat with you about the attached TDA document, before we publish this in the PDB or as a wire product we need to do some re writing a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" Kent wrote on April 3, using abbreviations to refer to the director of national intelligence, President's Daily Brief and President Trump. \"Wire product\" likely refers to a secure communications and information-exchange platform used across the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "In the April 3 email, Kent criticized the draft memorandum from the IC \u2014 the intelligence community \u2014 for leading with \"weak IC speak that basically says we can't prove via smoking gun intel that the Ven gov is directing TDA, making it sound like the Ven gov has nothing to do with TDA,\" according to its text. He later added, \"Another major issue I have with the analysis in this piece is its lack of context about the status of our border and immigration policy over the last 4 years.\"",
      "\"I understand some may view this as political but it is not, it's a simple verifiable reality that we cannot overlook,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Going forward, we need to implement the changes above and incorporate the FBI's assessment of TDA's relationship with the Ven gov upfront, then go into the rest of the document,\" Kent wrote.",
      "The FBI's view, which appears on page 2 of the final memorandum, notes the bureau's analysts \"agree\" with the intelligence community's broader assessment that the Maduro government is not directing TDA movement but assess \"some Venezuelan government officials facilitate TDA members' migration from Venezuela\" with the goal of destabilizing the U.S. and other governments.",
      "The intelligence community assessment notes \"most of the IC judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible.\" Another more heavily redacted section describes intelligence community reporting that suggests a link between TDA and some Venezuelan officials as \"limited.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who previously served as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" in its assessment that the Venezuelan government does not control TDA and that he agreed \"100% with the FBI's finding.\"",
      "While it is not uncommon for analysts' views to be challenged and tested by officials within the chain of command, edits are usually sought to make assessments more reflective of existing data and evidence, and to do so irrespective of government policy, current and former intelligence officials said.",
      "Policymakers are also not bound by what intelligence assessments may find, the officials said, but collection and analysis happen in order to provide officials with an optimal operating picture.",
      "It is not entirely clear from the email exchanges obtained by CBS News and final version of the memorandum how many changes to the text were made at Kent's request.",
      "In a subsequent set of email exchanges on April 4, Kent offered suggestions to replace language in the memorandum about TDA migration trends, arguing that policies under the Biden administration were a key influencing factor.",
      "\"Lets go with something like this,\" Kent wrote, adding as a proposed edit, \"The IC also recognizes that between January 2021 and January 2025 the United States immigration policies and border security posture made migration from Venezuela to the United States so easy that the Government of Venezuela did not need to push migrants to the United States, United States immigrations [sic] policy served as its own pulling factor.\"",
      "Kent later approved another suggested revision that read, \"Increased flow of irregular migration from Venezuelan nationals-including some TDA members\u2014could be attributed to a wide perception of lax U.S. immigration policies and a lack of screening at the border between 2021 and 2025.\"",
      "\"This looks great,\" Kent responded.",
      "The language that appears in the final assessment, however, is different, suggesting there was additional deliberation before it was finalized: \"The IC also recognizes the regime appreciates migration as a safety valve, allowing discontented Venezuelans to leave. US border encounters of Venezuelan national [sic] have decreased since January because of migrant perceptions of new US enforcement policies.\"",
      "The New York Times and Reuters first reported the existence and some of the content of Kent's emails.",
      "Gabbard has since fired the NIC acting chair, Michael Collins, and his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekof, both of whom were among email recipients discussing the memorandum.",
      "\"These Biden holdovers were dismissed because they politicized intelligence,\" Kent's deputy, Alexa Henning, later\u00a0said on X.",
      "A former Green Beret, CIA officer, and Republican congressional hopeful, Kent has been a close ally of Gabbard, who personally endorsed his previous political runs. President Trump nominated Kent to head the National Counterterrorism Center, a prominent office within ODNI and a role that requires Senate confirmation, in February.",
      "On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees raised alarm about Kent's apparent attempt to align an intelligence assessment with existing government policy and said consideration of his nomination for NCTC director should pause.",
      "\"This was a blatant attempt to politicize national security to appease a president who has repeatedly shown contempt for facts and for the intelligence professionals sworn to defend this country,\" committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the Senate should \"immediately halt consideration\" of Mr. Kent's nomination to lead NCTC.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes of Connecticut said, \"Seeking to strongarm analysts to suit the agenda of the President, and punishing them when they refuse to bend, is a road to national security disaster\u2014and yet that is precisely the road that this Administration has chosen.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday moved to terminate a longstanding court settlement that has obligated the U.S. government for nearly three decades to provide basic rights and services to migrant children in its custody.",
      "Since 1997, the settlement, known as the Flores Agreement, has required federal U.S. immigration officials to hold migrant children in facilities that are safe and sanitary; provide them access to lawyers; and seek their expeditious release from government custody.",
      "The legal agreement has also allowed lawyers to inspect detention facilities holding migrant minors, to determine whether conditions are adequate for children and that the government is complying with the provisions of the court settlement.",
      "While the settlement initially largely only applied to unaccompanied minors, in 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee extended the protections to migrant children detained with their parents, generally limiting the detention of such minors to 20 days. The Obama administration fought that ruling, as it sought to deter migrant families crossing the southern border illegally by detaining them while their asylum cases were decided.",
      "In a filing on Thursday, the Justice Department told Gee, who is based in Los Angeles, that the Flores settlement should be \"completely\" terminated. It argued the agreement has hamstrung the executive branch from effectively setting immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings by migrant families and unaccompanied minors.",
      "\"After 40 years of litigation and 28 years of judicial control over a critical element of U.S. immigration policy by one district court located more than 100 miles from any international border, it is time for this case to end,\" the Justice Department said in its filing.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that, through laws and government regulations, the government has codified some of the provisions of the Flores agreement.",
      "Thursday's move was not entirely surprising. The first Trump administration also tried to terminate the Flores agreement, making similar legal and political arguments against the settlement. But its efforts were blocked by Gee, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The Justice Department on Thursday also asked Gee to lift a ruling that blocked the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing a 2019 regulation that would have allowed the government to detain migrant families indefinitely, bypassing her 20-day limit.",
      "The Trump administration's bid will be challenged by the attorneys representing migrant children covered by the Flores agreement, which they say is critical to ensuring those minors are treated humanely while in U.S. care.",
      "\"Eliminating the Settlement's core protections would hand the government unchecked power to imprison children indefinitely in secret facilities \u2014 places with no standards, no transparency, and no accountability,\" said Mishan Wroe, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law.",

      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration to pause a pair of lower court rulings that voided Mr. Trump's removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "\"Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents,\" the court said. \"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power. But we do not ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or MSPB falls within such a recognized exception; that question is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision.",
      "Kagan wrote in her dissent, \"Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, without a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from a classic independent agency\u2014a multi-member, bipartisan commission exercising regulatory power whose governing statute contains a for-cause provision. Yet now the President has discharged, concededly without cause, several such officers, including a member of the NLRB (Gwynne Wilcox) and a member of the MSPB (Cathy Harris). Today, this Court effectively blesses those deeds. I would not.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had already temporarily halted the decisions to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider Mr. Trump's emergency appeal. The order from the full court means Wilcox and Harris will remain out of their jobs while the challenge to their firings continues.",
      "Wilcox and Harris' employment statuses have ping-ponged since they were informed by the Trump administration earlier this year that they were removed from their respective roles. Wilcox had been appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed to a second five-year term in 2023. Harris was tapped by Biden to serve on the MSPB in 2022 for a seven-year term.",
      "Each official sued the Trump administration over their firings, arguing they violated the for-cause removal laws that limited the president's ability to oust them. Two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., agreed and voided the firings. The judges each said Wilcox and Harris could remain in their roles at their respective agencies while their litigation plays out.",
      "But a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit paused those decisions, allowing the president to fire Harris and Wilcox again. The two then asked the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider their cases, and it ruled 7-4 to put the district court decisions back in place, meaning Harris and Wilcox could return to their jobs while their challenges moved forward.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in and again allow Mr. Trump to oust Wilcox and Harris. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the request for emergency relief that the Constitution gives the president broad power to remove members of multimember boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" such as the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "He argued that a court violates Article II of the Constitution by ordering an executive officer who was removed by the president to be reinstated to their position.",
      "Sauer also argued that the NLRB and MSPB are not covered by an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "The Trump administration did not ask the Supreme Court to overturn that decision in its emergency request, but did suggest that it could consider whether to invalidate the for-cause removal restrictions governing members of the NLRB and MSPB as a violation of the separation of powers. It has, however, said that it would ask the Supreme Court to overrule the 1935 ruling after it receives full briefing and argument and find that it was wrongly decided.",
      "But lawyers for Harris and Wilcox each warned that the administration is asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the structure of numerous agencies, putting at risk the independence of entities like the Federal Reserve Board, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Trump had indicated that he would like to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who he appointed during his first term, writing on social media in April that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" But the president then walked back the suggestion, saying he has \"no intention\" of getting rid of the Fed chief.",
      "The Supreme Court, however, said the structure of the Federal Reserve Board is not threatened because it is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "But Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration and is representing Harris, wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president is simply being asked to follow binding precedent, just as his predecessors have done for 90 years.",
      "\"History disproves the government's assertion that the president will be irreparably harmed if he cannot remove Harris,\" he wrote. \"No other president in our lifetimes has ever attempted to violate for-cause removal statutes in this manner. The current chief executive is not being held to a different standard.\"",
      "Katyal also said the MPSB is covered by the exception set by the Supreme Court in its 1935 decision.",
      "\"The board is the easy case,\" he said. \"If the board's structure is not constitutional under Humphrey's Executor, nothing is.\"",
      "In a separate filing, a lawyer for Wilcox, Deepak Gupta, said the statute that lays out the parameters for firing NLRB members has been on the books for nearly 100 years, and no presidential administration until now has tried to remove a member of the board.",
      "\"Nevertheless, the government now claims that its need to remove Gwynne Wilcox is urgent \u2014 so urgent that it asks this court to override the en banc D.C. Circuit's denial of a stay, jettison a century of settled interbranch practice, and signal the overruling of bedrock precedents of this court that have engendered strong reliance interests. The better course is restraint,\" he wrote.",
      "Gupta disputed the Trump administration's claim that it needs emergency relief,, which would require the Supreme Court to \"upend decades of tradition to allow the president to remove an NLRB member for the first time now \u2014 before this court has even had the opportunity to reconsider its longstanding precedent.\"",
      "Beyond the seat on the NLRB that had been filled by Wilcox and Harris' position on the MSPB, there are still vacancies at both agencies that Mr. Trump can fill. But lawyers for both have argued the president's firings have hobbled the boards and stymied their ability to adjudicate labor and employment disputes.",
      "\"By depriving the board of the quorum it needs to carry out its appellate decision making, the president's illegal removal causes immediate harm to the workers, employers, and broader public who depend on it,\" Gupta wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping reshaping of the executive branch. He has fired top officials leading a swath of independent agencies and institutions, and gotten rid of independent agency watchdogs. His administration is moving to dismantle other federal entities and programs, sparking legal challenges.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said last month that it would be reinstating student visa records for more than 4,700 students.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday blocked federal immigration officials with the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students while a legal battle moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who sits on the U.S. district court in Oakland, California, found that a group of foreign nationals who are in the country on F-1 student visas but had their legal status terminated were likely to succeed in a challenge to the Trump administration's actions.",
      "White said in a 21-page decision that federal immigration officials don't suggest that the plaintiffs pose an immediate threat to safety or national security. But the students, he wrote, will \"continue to suffer significant hardship\" because of the administration's actions, absent judicial relief.",
      "White, nominated by President George W. Bush, wrote that the relief provided to the plaintiffs gives them a \"measure of stability and certainty that they will be able to continue their studies or their employment without the threat of re-termination hanging over their heads.\"",
      "His nationwide injunction blocks immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs in the case or those who are similarly situated until the dispute is resolved, and from transferring them outside of the jurisdiction where they live. White's order also bars the Trump administration from reversing its reinstatement of certain international students' legal status.",
      "The cases were brought by foreign nationals who were admitted to the U.S. through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement oversees. The plaintiffs were in the country on F-1 visas, and records relating to their immigration status are housed in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, a database that tracks international students' compliance with their visa status.",
      "But in early April, the plaintiffs and thousands of other international students in the U.S. on F-1 visas learned that their SEVIS records had been terminated as part of the Trump administration's \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative\" for \"otherwise failing to maintain status.\"",
      "They said that terminating their SEVIS record effectively terminates their F-1 status, which governs whether they're in the U.S. lawfully. The plaintiffs said they were told their legal status had been terminated because they were \"identified in a criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who filed their lawsuit against the Trump administration last month, argued that while they each have had some contact with law enforcement, none has a criminal history that would pose a threat\u00a0to their legal status in the U.S. or render them deportable.",
      "After the international students filed their lawsuit against federal immigration authorities, a federal judge granted temporary restraining orders, which White later extended. Then, a Justice Department lawyer said that ICE had started reinstating SEVIS records for more than 4,700 students who had their student visa records terminated.",
      "But White said those changes weren't enough, and warned that the Trump administration's actions since the cases were filed \"raise the concern that they may be trying to place any future SEVIS terminations beyond judicial review.\"",
      "\"At each turn in this and similar litigation across the nation, defendants have abruptly changed course to satisfy courts' expressed concerns. It is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations,\" he wrote.",
      "White's order came after he held a hearing on motions for preliminary injunctions last week and learned during the proceedings that ICE had been restoring SEVIS records retroactively and that the administration planned to send letters to all student visa-holders impacted by the mass cancellations.",
      "Still, he granted their requests for the injunction and rejected the Trump administration's argument that a SEVIS record is not tied to immigration status, calling it \"unpersuasive and unsupported.\"",
      "\"By terminating plaintiffs' SEVIS records, defendants altered plaintiffs' legal status within the United States,\" White wrote.",
      "He also chided the Trump administration's so-called \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative,\" and said that it underscored the need for nationwide relief.",
      "\"That initiative is a uniform policy that uniformly wreaked havoc not only on the lives of plaintiffs here but on similarly situated F-1 nonimmigrants across the United States and continues do so,\" White wrote.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans led the push to block California's ability to impose tough limits on car emissions \u2014 a move Democrats call unprecedented.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate on Thursday voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move that the chamber's parliamentarian says Republican lawmakers may not have the right to make.",
      "The vote was 51-44, with Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan joining Republicans in voting in favor of revoking the waivers.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called it \"the nuclear option.\"",
      "The three waivers the Senate revoked set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations. Two waivers relate to reducing tailpipe emissions from medium and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as limiting smog pollution from trucks.",
      "The last is what's frequently called California's \"EV mandate,\" a rule that aims to phase-out gas powered cars and require all new vehicle sales in California be zero emissions by 2035. The rule to phase out gas powered vehicles goes into effect in 2026.",
      "California was granted the ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government under the Clean Air Act in a process that involves receiving a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency if the regulations meet certain\u00a0requirements. The three waivers in question were approved by the Biden administration's Environmental Protection Agency in 2024.",
      "Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act gives Congress the ability to overturn rules passed by federal agencies \u2014\u00a0 including the waivers \u2014 by a simple majority vote, but nonpartisan government watchdogs do not agree. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian found that the Congressional Review Act could not be used to vote down California's waivers because the waivers are not the same as rules, according to Senate Democrats.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who supported revoking the waivers, said in remarks Tuesday on the Senate floor that \"the EPA has submitted the waivers to Congress as rules \u2014 which is all that Congress has ever needed to decide to consider something under the Congressional Review Act.\"",
      "But Democrats say such a vote is illegal, and argue overruling the parliamentarian and bypassing the filibuster sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "\"If they invoke this nuclear option now, they should expect that a future Democratic government will have to revisit decades worth of paltry corporate settlements, deferred prosecution agreements, and tax rulings that were overly favorable to multinationals and ultra-wealthy individuals,\" said Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a statement.",
      "The California Air Resources Board, a state body that designed the vehicle emissions regulations and requested the waivers, measures and sets pollution standards in California to comply with the Clean Air Act. It claims that the state has applied for over 100 waivers that have resulted in vehicles being 99% cleaner in terms of pollution, compared to vehicles from 1970. The board says they have never had a waiver revoked in the 50 years it has had the ability to enact them.",
      "\"The law is that the Clean Air Act says California can set its own standards if they are more stringent, more environmentally protective than whatever the federal government standard is,\" said Mary Nichols, who was the California Air Resources Board chairwoman from 1975-1982 and then from 2007-2020. Nichols told CBS News that if Congress uses Congressional Review Act to revoke the waivers, the state of California will sue the federal government.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Thursday that they would sue the Trump administration over the vote.",
      "\"This Senate vote is illegal,\" Newsom said. \"Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent. We won't stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again \u2014 undoing work that goes back to the days of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan \u2014 all while ceding our economic future to China. We're going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.\"",
      "Voting down California's waivers is expected to impact cities and states across the country, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.",
      "Republicans have staunchly criticized California's emissions rules, especially the one aimed at driving the auto industry toward electric vehicles.",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican who chairs the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, said this week that the rules amount to \"forcing certain states and certain consumers to purchase a vehicle that they may not want or that they can't find.\"",
      "The auto industry has been pushing for Republicans to revoke California's waivers. The Specialty Equipment Market Association represents the automotive aftermarket industry, where a third of its businesses are dependent on internal combustion engines and see the waivers and expansion of electric vehicles as a threat to business.",
      "\"The death of California's waiver will give life to more than 330,000 American jobs and preserves over $100 billion of economic impact to the nation's economy,\" the association said in a statement.",
      "But environmental groups are alarmed by the unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke the waivers. The Environmental Defense Fund said in a statement that a vote by Congress would undermine California's ability to address pollution.",
      "\"Using the CRA on EPA's preemption waivers could create a precedent for sweeping congressional nullifications of other executive actions that are outside the scope of the CRA \u2014 from decisions about Americans' eligibility for Social Security, to waivers for state Medicaid or veterans' health benefits, to actions related to energy infrastructure projects,\" the group said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of eight migrants is being held in the small African country of Djibouti after a judge said the Trump administration's attempt to fly them to South Sudan \"unquestionably\" violated a court order, President Trump confirmed Thursday.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out at U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, who ordered the government to \"maintain custody and control\" of the migrants on Tuesday. Attorneys say the migrants were put on a flight to violence-plagued South Sudan, allegedly violating an earlier order by Murphy requiring migrants to be given certain due process rights before they're deported to a third country. The Trump administration says the eight men have serious criminal records.",
      "\"A Federal Judge in Boston, who knew absolutely nothing about the situation, or anything else, has ordered that EIGHT of the most violent criminals on Earth curtail their journey to South Sudan, and instead remain in Djibouti,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"He would not allow these monsters to proceed to their final destination.\"",
      "Djibouti is a small country on the Horn of Africa on the continent's east coast, located across the Gulf of Aden from the Arabian Peninsula. Two U.S. officials told CBS News the migrants are being held at a\u00a0U.S. military base in the country.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"a large number of ICE Officers\" were also left with the men.",
      "Murphy has ordered the Trump administration to give six men \"reasonable fear\" interviews to screen them for any concerns about being harmed in a third country. If they do not satisfy the reasonable fear standard, the government must give them at least 15 days to challenge their removal. Murphy says the men can be held either in the U.S. or abroad, as long as the government maintains custody over them.",
      "The back-and-forth began Tuesday, when lawyers for some of the deportees told Murphy a group of migrants was being flown to South Sudan. They warned the migrants face \"a strong likelihood of irreparable harm\" if they are deported to South Sudan, a 14-year-old country racked with violence and political instability.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, Murphy said the attempted deportations were \"unquestionably violative\" of his April order requiring the government to give deportees notice of their final destination and a chance to challenge their removal. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object,\" the judge said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security later identified the eight men as nationals of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Myanmar and Vietnam. In a statement, DHS listed out criminal convictions for all eight of the deportees, including murder, lascivious acts with a child and sexual assault \u2014 describing them as the \"Worst of the Worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration has blasted Murphy's ruling, with the DHS alleging he is \"trying to force the United States to bring these criminals back.\" Mr. Trump wrote on Thursday: \"The Judges are absolutely out of control, they're hurting our Country, and they know nothing about particular situations, or what they are doing.\"",
      "The government's push to ramp up deportations \u2014 in some cases sending migrants to places other than their country of origin \u2014 has drawn pushback from judges and attorneys, who argue the swift removals deprive migrants of due process.

And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-deduction-cap-trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-40000-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:03:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

      "Two lawsuits were brought against the Education Department and were consolidated in this case: a number of states who had sued and some local school districts from around the country.",
      "\"Indeed, prior to the RIF, the Department was already struggling to meet its goals, so it is only reasonable to expect that an RIF of this magnitude will likely cripple the Department. The idea that Defendants' actions are merely a 'reorganization' is plainly not true,\" Joun wrote in his decision.",
      "\"Defendants do acknowledge, as they must, that the Department cannot be shut down without Congress's approval, yet they simultaneously claim that their legislative goals (obtaining Congressional approval to shut down the Department) are distinct from their administrative goals (improving efficiency),\" Joun wrote.",
      "\"There is nothing in the record to support these contradictory positions,\" Joun wrote. \"Not only is there no evidence that Defendants are pursuing a 'legislative goal' or otherwise working with Congress to reach a resolution, but there is also no evidence that the RIF has actually made the Department more efficient. Rather, the record is replete with evidence of the opposite.\"",

      "The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out, a Treasury official told CBS MoneyWatch. The blanks \u2014 flat, metal discs that the Mint turns into coins \u2014 will run out in early 2026, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.",
      "The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. The 1-cent coin cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill Thursday following a dramatic all-night session and days of negotiations.",
      "In a 215 to 214 vote, all but two House Republicans supported the massive budget package \u2014 the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 in a vote that came hours after unveiling an updated version of the legislation that GOP leaders hoped would satisfy enough holdouts. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",
      "The measure cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the wee hours of the morning, teeing up the vote on final passage after days of consternation among the House Republican conference.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition.",
      "\"We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the vote Thursday, pledging to get the package to the president's desk in the coming weeks. \"We're going to get it there by Independence Day on July 4, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the bill's passage \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.",
      "But as Johnson's self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.",
      "A 42-page manager's amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday included changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, a change sought by hardliners.",
      "Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Johnson could only afford three defections on the bill, with all members present and voting, given his slim majority. Massie was the sole Republican to oppose the key procedural vote on the measure earlier Thursday.",
      "\"If something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight,\" Massie said on the House floor.",
      "Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, delivered his final pitch to House Republicans ahead of the vote, urging that the bill will deliver on GOP promises.",
      "\"If you vote no, you're voting against American energy, you're voting against securing America's border, you're voting against helping those middle class families,\" Scalise said.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation on the House floor, saying it \"gets Americans back to winning again.\"",
      "\"This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,\" the speaker said.",
      "All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a \"reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.\"",
      "\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote came after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Harris, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday.

      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",

      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",

      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",

Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",

      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",

      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",

      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing.

    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\"Providing some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, most states have not.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 12:16:41 -0400",
    "summary": "It is Harvard's second suit against the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, hours after the Ivy League school challenged a decision by administration officials that targeted its enrollment.",
      "U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed to grant Harvard's request for immediate relief and set a hearing for May 29, during which she will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction in the case. Her order blocks the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "Her brief order said the temporary order is \"justified to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.\"",
      "The judge's intervention came hours after Harvard filed a federal lawsuit over the\u00a0Trump administration's decision to bar it from enrolling foreign students, calling it unconstitutional retaliation for defying the White House's political demands. It is the school's second suit against the Trump administration.",
      "In the lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government's action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard said in its suit.",
      "Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries.",
      "The school had said it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move, which the department announced on Thursday. It accused Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \"anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\" to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the action against Harvard will \"serve as a warning\" to other universities.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on \"its core, legally-protected principles\" over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The threat to Harvard's international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation.",
      "Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.",
      "\"The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,\" Garber said in a statement Friday to member of the Harvard community.",
      "\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he said.",
      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said.",
      "An earlier suit from the university challenged more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration. That suit came after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "The lawsuit, which Burroughs is also overseeing, alleged the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding and claimed that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "China's government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban foreign students from Harvard would harm the United States' international standing. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard's international student population, with 1,203 coming from China in 2024.",
      "Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by the Trump administration's decision. Large portions of the men's rowing and squash and women's soccer and golf rosters list international hometowns on the school's website. Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on Harvard athletic rosters for the 2024-25 seasons had international hometowns.",

      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",

      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "story": [
      "The House Republicans' campaign arm is focusing a new advertising campaign on Democrats from politically risky seats who voted against the GOP's sweeping effort to cut taxes and pass Medicaid work requirements, setting the stage for what may prove to be one of the biggest political messaging clashes of next year's midterms.",
      "Republicans in Washington are attempting to use their control of Congress and the White House to put in place major conservative agenda items sought by President Donald Trump and his allies through one massive piece of legislation, titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" The House GOP's narrow passage of Trump's agenda earlier this week has set off a struggle between Republicans and Democrats to sway voters about the impact of the bill that is widely expected to play a large role in the 2026 midterm elections, where control of the House will be decided.",
      "In a statement about the advertising campaign, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said the campaign arm \"will make sure voters don't forget how [House Democrats] betrayed working families.\"",
      "The round of digital advertisements places a particular emphasis on the tax portion of the Trump agenda bill, which continues key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was the centerpiece of his first term in office. Plans show the ads will target\u00a0 25 House Democrats and make the argument that by opposing this week's bill, the Democrats voted \"for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.\" Of those 25 districts, 13 are seats where a Democrat won the House contest while Trump carried the district in the presidential race.",
      "Republicans' best chance at padding their narrow majority next year could come in places that had some of the closest Congressional races in the entire country during the 2024 presidential election, including a California seat where the Democratic candidate ousted a Republican incumbent by less than 200 votes. Other areas closely watched by the GOP that are also the subject of the latest ad campaign include two Democrat-held seats in the red state of Ohio, districts Trump won in the battleground states of North Carolina and Michigan, as well as seats that could prove to be competitive in New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.",
      "Yet while many House Republicans in Washington are cheering the legislation, Democrats see ample political liabilities for their opponents. Democratic leaders view the House as the party's best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington during Trump's presidency, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election and the small number of seats it would likely take to flip control of the chamber.",
      "The GOP's targeting of Medicaid in particular has quickly been seized on by the left as a major campaign issue, as Democrats charge the Republican agenda's changes imperil healthcare for millions of people.",
      "\"America cannot afford the Republican tax scam. Now that vulnerable Republicans are on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026,\" Washington Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, said in a statement earlier this week.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 11:01:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has overseen a wide-ranging effort to restructure the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday continued to block the Trump administration from moving forward with its plans to lay off thousands of government workers at more than 20 federal agencies, providing federal employees a lifeline as a legal challenge to President Trump's bid to restructure the federal government moves forward.",
      "The preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston covers 21 federal agencies and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and prevents them from implementing reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The judge, who sits on the federal court in San Francisco, also barred agencies from implementing any orders by the Elon Musk-led DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with an executive order signed by President Trump in February that seeks to transform the executive branch. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as AmeriCorps and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "While Illston also granted retrospective relief by ordering federal agencies to rescind any reductions-in-force, or layoffs, issued under the president's February directive and to reinstate government workers who were put on administrative leave, she paused those components of her decision while the administration pursues an appeal.",
      "The Justice Department informed the court on Friday that it will be asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to review Illston's decision.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "She said that the plaintiffs in the case, which are labor unions, nonprofit organizations and local governments, are likely to succeed on their claim that Mr. Trump's executive order usurps Congress's constitutional powers and exceeds his authority.",
      "\"Put simply, in this case, defendants want the court to either declare that nine presidents and twenty-one Congresses did not properly understand the separation of powers, or ignore how the executive branch is implementing large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations. The court can do neither,\" Illston wrote.",
      "Illston had issued a two-week temporary restraining order on May 9 that directed the Trump administration to pause its plans to lay off vast swaths of the federal workforce. That temporary order was set to expire Friday. Her preliminary injunction now extends the initial block on the administration's restructuring of the federal government as the case proceeds.",
      "The Trump administration already asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to allow it to move forward with its reductions-in-force, seeking emergency relief in a request that arose out of Illston's temporary restraining order. The high court has not yet acted on that bid, though the Justice Department will likely ask the Supreme Court to lift Illston's injunction.",
      "Mr. Trump's February executive order directed agencies to make plans to initiate \"large -scale\" reductions in force as part of his initiative to slash the size of the federal government. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts, due March 13 and April 14.",
      "The Trump administration has said in filings that 40 reductions-in-force at 17 agencies were in progress but blocked by Illston's May 9 order. The plans target\u00a0thousands of federal workers, including up to 10,000 at the Department of Health and Human Services, 8,500 at the Energy Department and half of the workforce at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Department of Veterans Affairs has said it intends to slash 83,000 positions.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "Mr. Trump's government-shrinking efforts began shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force led by Musk, and his administration has taken steps to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

      "The Trump administration on Thursday revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students in its escalating battle with the Ivy League school, saying thousands of students must transfer to other schools or leave the country. Harvard filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration, arguing that its action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "The school said Friday that it would file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the Trump administration's move.",
      "\"We are looking into the situation, to see what kind of impact this decision might have on the princess, or not. It's too early to say right now,\" said the Belgian palace's communications head, Xavier Baert.",

      "Skeletal remains found on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as those of a 19th-century schooner captain, thanks to the investigative efforts of college students.",
      "The ship, the Oriental, sank in 1844. The schooner was transporting 60 tons of marble from Connecticut to Philadelphia to be used in the construction of Girard College, which still operates today. The ship likely sprung a leak, according to a news release announcing the identification of the remains, and sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal. All five crew members aboard the ship died.",
      "The skeletal remains, including a skull, were found on a number of South Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013. The set of remains became known as \"Scattered Man John Doe.\" Police efforts to identify the bones failed.",
      "In 2023, the New Jersey State Police partnered with Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. A sample from the bones was uploaded to genetic genealogy company Intermountain Forensics, which submitted it to DNA matching sites in February 2024. Meanwhile, students at Ramapo used the profile for research.",
      "They found ancestry matches dating back to the 1600s, including genetic relatives from Connecticut. For the next year, students continued to find ties to Connecticut, and eventually they started looking at shipwrecks off the coast of New Jersey. They came upon two articles about the sinking of the Oriental. One article named the crew members aboard at the time of the sinking and\u00a0another detailed the wreck itself.",
      "\"The storm was so tremendous that no help could be given from the shore,\" said the article, which was published in the Boston Daily Bee in December 1844 and described an account from a Connecticut publication.",
      "According to the article, one crew member was \"decently buried\" after his \"corpse was thrown on the shore.\" No other bodies were discovered immediately after the sinking.",
      "The circumstantial evidence and genetic ancestry led the students to believe \"Scattered Man John Doe\" might be the captain of the ship, Henry Goodsell. Goodsell was 29 at the time of his death, and left a wife and three children, according to the Boston Daily Bee. The New Jersey State Police collected a family reference sample from one of his great-grandchildren in March 2025.",
      "In April 2025, the NJSP confirmed that \"Scattered Man John Doe\" was Goodsell. This has become one of the oldest cold case identifications using investigative genetic genealogy, Ramapo said.",
      "\"Identifying human remains is one of the most solemn and challenging responsibilities law enforcement is charged with,\" said Chief of County Detectives Patrick Snyder at the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office. \"Law enforcement works hard knowing that behind every case is a promise: that no one will be forgotten, and that we will pursue the truth until families have the answers they deserve.\"",
      "The Ramapo College IGG Center has consulted on 92 cases, Ramapo said. Two months ago, the program was credited with helping identify the remains of a woman who disappeared in 2014. In November 2024, student research led to an arrest in a decades-old cold case.",

    "story": [
      "On May 18, relatives of the Venezuelan migrant detainees in El Salvador's mega prison CECOT, announced to a WhatsApp group the death of Marlene Ramirez, a grandmother who raised one of the men currently detained there, Jonathan Mendoza Ramirez. Her family said she had died of a heart attack, unable to endure the emotional stress of not being able to communicate with her grandson. She could no longer take it, they said.",
      "Since the Trump administration in March removed a group of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members to El Salvador for indefinite detention, a WhatsApp virtual community has come into being, made up largely of mothers of the detainees. The group grew one by one, as the mothers found out about their sons' whereabouts, largely from videos posted on social media by the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. The videos showed the Venezuelan men arriving from the U.S. in shackles, being frog-marched off the plane and into CECOT. Inside the prison, they were forced to kneel as their heads were shaved by guards.",
      "\"I can't recount these videos or else I fall into a serious depression,\" said Jetzy Arteaga, the creator of the WhatsApp group. Her son, Carlos Ca\u00f1izalez Arteaga, is one of the Venezuelan migrants\u00a0transferred to CECOT in March. \"I try to block them, so that I can go on about my day, but only a mother in this situation can understand why these images hurt so much.\" On days when she can't keep the images out of her thoughts, Arteaga says she can't get out of bed and turns to other mothers in the group chat.",
      "\"When one of us is down, we go to their house, run their errands and pick up their other kids from school,\" says Arteaga. \"They're all over Venezuela, and I understand that today, it might be them needing help, but tomorrow it might be me in the hospital.\"",
      "Arteaga created the group to communicate with other mothers because she says she needed answers. \"I was in a state of disbelief, and I was waiting for the U.S. government to say my son was transferred by mistake,\" said Arteaga. \"The U.S. is a country that follows their laws, and when their investigation concludes my son is not a gang member, they'll release him.\"",
      "Records that prove his lack of criminal gang activity in Venezuela, however, have not led to Carlos' release. The group says it has grown and now includes relatives of 170 of the migrant men detained in El Salvador.",
      "\"The first thing I do every morning is check the group chat, and we ask for updates and prayers,\" said Analia Burbano, whose nephew Victor Andres Ortega Burbano, is being held in CECOT. She says she constantly scrolls through social media to see if there are any updates or photos of her nephew in prison.",
      "Burbano says she is now speaking on behalf of her nephew because his mother is emotionally and physically unable to do so. \"Ever since she saw the video of Victor at CECOT, she fell into a depression, does not get up from bed, does not eat and cries every day,\" said Burbano. \"She is very frail.\"",
      "Burbano says her nephew's arrest and transfer came as a surprise, since Ortega had been granted Temporary Protected Status that allowed him to legally work in the U.S. According to immigration documents reviewed by CBS News, Ortega's TPS was approved for June 2024 through last month, in April.",
      "The group frequently makes trips to Miramar, Venezuela, to pressure officials to demand the release and deportation of the men back to their country. The chat serves as a venue to plan the next protest or opportunity to publicize the men's plight at events like those held by the United Nations.",
      "\"We all have our ups and downs, but through this process, we make sure that none of us let the negative thoughts linger for long,\" said Anyi Yohana Casares Jimenez, mother of Jason Alfredo Silva Casares. On March 13, Jimenez says she received the last call from her son, desperately asking her to send over documents proving he didn't have a criminal record in Venezuela. She never heard from him again.",
      "Jason showed up at the U.S. southern border in August 2024 after receiving an appointment through the CBP One app, but remained in detention because immigration agents were suspicious of his crown tattoo, according to his mother. \"There's not a day that I don't search social media for any new videos of him inside CECOT.\"",
      "The three mothers all claim their sons are not part of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, but they do fault the men's tattoos for causing their imprisonment.",
      "\"It was the argument I always had with my son,\" said Arteaga. \"I always asked what his need for a tattoo was.\" Her son tattooed his mother's name \"Jetzy\" on his wrist, a tattoo that now serves as evidence of gang affiliation, according to court documents.",
      "It's now been more than two months since these men were taken to El Salvador and the U.S. government continues to deport anyone who is in the country illegally after President Trump promised to deport \"the worst of the worst\".",

      "Peter Wang, a member of this year's West Point class, was just 15 years old when he was among the 17 killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",
      "When the sounds of gunfire reverberated through the hallways, Peter was in study hall, passing time over a chessboard. As panic spread through the corridors, he moved toward the exit\u2014not to flee, but to hold the door open, easing the way for his classmates to escape behind him.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator for the state of Florida at the time of the shooting, told CBS News the tributes to Peter were a \"solemn recognition of [his] bravery and heroism on that horrific day. Duty, honor, and country are key pillars of West Point cadets, and it's clear Peter personified these principles.\"",
      "He was shot 13 times, first in the foot, then twice more in the thigh. A round tore through his torso. His arms absorbed five more bullets. The final shots\u2014four in total\u2014were to his head, according to Wendolyn Sneed, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy and testified at the shooter's sentencing hearing.",
      "Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, now a U.S. senator, authorized the Florida National Guard to honor Peter with a military funeral. Hundreds assembled in South Florida to pay their respects, with attendees spanning generations and backgrounds.",
      "Junior ROTC cadets from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and other South Florida schools stood saluting in uniform, joined by military veterans and local residents. The gathering reflected the deep impact Peter had on both his peers and the wider community.",
      "An American flag was draped over Peter's casket as \"Taps\" echoed through the air and salutes rose from all corners of the crowd. Among them were veterans with lined faces, uniformed service members, and first responders in dress attire. But it was the youngest among them\u2014fellow Junior ROTC cadets in crisp uniforms\u2014who stood most still.",
      "For his actions, Peter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army, the highest award given to Army JROTC and ROTC cadets whose performance \"involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.\" Junior ROTC cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, who were also killed during the shooting, also received the medal.",

      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry identified the victims as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, and referred to them both as embassy staff members. The Israeli Embassy said the pair were \"in the prime of their lives.\"",
      "\"No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss,\" the embassy said in a statement on social media. \"Our hearts are with their families, and the embassy will be by their side during this terrible time.\"",
      "Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., told reporters the pair was a \"beautiful couple,\" and said Lischinsky had purchased an engagement ring \"with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.\" World leaders\u00a0quickly condemned\u00a0the slayings.",
      "Sarah Lynn Milgrim",
      "Milgrim, a 26-year-old American, was from Kansas. Her father, Robert Milgrim, said she started working for the embassy in November 2023 after earning a bachelor's degree at Kansas University and two master's degrees \u2014 one at American University in Washington, D.C., and the other at the United Nations for Peace University in Costa Rica. Her degrees focused on international studies and policy, he said, and she had been hired at the Israeli Embassy before the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack that left 1,200 Israelis dead and touched off the war in Gaza.",
      "\"This is her first real job after finishing her six years of education,\" Robert Milgrim told CBS News.",
      "The Kansas University chapter of Hillel, the world's largest Jewish campus life organization, remembered Milgrim as a \"beloved alum\" whose \"bright spirit and passion for the Jewish community touched everyone fortunate enough to know her.\" She served on the organization's board of directors, KU Hillel said.",
      "Before working for the embassy, Milgrim spent several summers in Israel where she worked with \"Palestinian and Israeli groups to bring them together,\" Robert Milgrim said. She made both Palestinian and Israeli friends on those trips, he said.",
      "\"She loves Israel and she loved everybody that lived in the Middle East,\" Robert Milgrim said.",
      "Robert Milgrim said his daughter met Lischinsky while earning a master's degree at American University. The two started dating weeks after they met, and the family \"loved\" Lischinsky, her father said.",
      "He said the couple was flying to Israel on Sunday to meet Lischinsky's family in Jerusalem, adding that he was told Lischinsky had been planning to propose on the trip.",
      "\"We didn't know that he was going to propose then,\" Robert Milgrim said. \"And the ambassador told us that he knew that he'd bought the ring and was going to present it to her in Jerusalem.\"",
      "Milgrim said on her LinkedIn page that her passion was \"at the intersection of peacebuilding, religious engagement, and environmental work,\" and said she was committed \"to fostering understanding between different peoples.\"",
      "\"No matter who this was, it would have been sad and hard and difficult, but to have it be somebody who embodied a spirit of peace, of love, of curiosity, of understanding, makes it extra hard,\" her friend Sheila Katz told CBS News.",
      "\"She gave her all to everything. She was loving and compassionate,\" Katz said.",
      "Yaron Lischinsky",
      "Lischinsky, 30, was an Israeli and German dual national. He was born in the German city of Nuremberg, according to veteran Israeli diplomat Ron Prosor, who says he had Lischinsky as a master's student at Reichman University, a private university in Israel.",
      "\"He was a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause,\" Prosor said in a post on X. \"He embodied the Judeo-Christian values and set an example for young people worldwide.\"",
      "Lischinsky moved to Israel when he was 16, according to his LinkedIn page, and was fluent in English, Hebrew and German.",
      "Lore Herzog, who knew Lischinsky since 2018, said he \"spoke fondly of growing up\" in Bavaria, a region of southern Germany, and was \"very much in love with his childhood home\" there. He came from a large family, Herzog said.",
      "\"He loved them all dearly and spoke about them all the time,\" Herzog said.",
      "Herzog remembered Lischinsky as a \"very morally upright person with a very strong sense of justice.\" The two met while living in Jerusalem.",
      "\"Yaron was super cheerful and seemed to really love everything he did,\" said Herzog, who now lives in Amsterdam. \"It was his dream to work in politics and international relations.\"",
      "On his LinkedIn profile, Lischinsky said he advocated for interfaith dialogue and intercultural understanding. He said that he was an \"ardent believer\" in deepening Israel's ties with the Arab world through the U.S.-brokered agreements known as the Abraham Accords.",
      "Suspect in custody",
      "Elias Rodriguez has been named as a suspect in the shooting and is currently in custody, officials said. He was charged on Thursday\u00a0with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials, causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. All are felonies, and the murder charges carry up to life in prison or the death sentence, if he is convicted.",
      "Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago, was initially \"observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum\" before he approached a group of four people, \"produced a handgun,\" and shot Lischinsky and Milgrim, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a news briefing.",
      "Rodriguez entered the Jewish Museum immediately after the shooting, and was arrested by museum security, Smith said. Witness video shows Rodriguez shouted \"Free Palestine\" while being arrested.",
      "Rodriguez had discarded the weapon used in the shooting, but told police where it was. It has since been recovered, Smith said.",
      "Rodriguez also \"chanted 'free, free Palestine,' while in custody,\" Smith said.",
      "Metropolitan Police said Rodriguez didn't pop up on an initial search of crime databases and wasn't on the radar of law enforcement agencies. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city's police department and the FBI will be investigating the shooting.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 09:53:49 -0400",
    "summary": "It's the latest step taken by the Trump administration to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests across the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has launched an operation to terminate the immigration court cases of certain migrants, in order to arrest them and place them in a fast-tracked deportation process instead, government officials and attorneys told CBS News.",
      "Lawyers and advocates this week reported arrests of migrants outside of immigration courthouses across the U.S., saying teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had detained individuals whose cases in front of immigration judges had just been terminated at the request of the government.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News that ICE is conducting an operation to expedite the deportation of migrants with court hearings scheduled in the near future. It's the latest step taken by the Trump administration to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests across the country and fulfill what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in American history.",
      "The operation involves ICE prosecutors asking immigration judges to terminate the court cases of certain migrants, so agents at the agency can instead arrest those individuals and place them in a more rapid deportation process known as \"expedited removal,\" the officials said.",
      "Unlike immigration court proceedings, which can take years to complete due to a massive backlog of 4 million pending cases, the expedited removal process allows officials to more quickly deport migrants, if their cases satisfy certain conditions.",
      "Migrants who lack proper documents and can't prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years are eligible to be deported under expedited removal, without a court hearing.",
      "Historically, officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks. But the Trump administration vastly expanded its scope soon after taking office.",
      "Expedited removal can also be applied to unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. with the government's permission at legal entry points, and there's no two-year entry limit for those cases. That would place the nearly 1 million migrants who entered the U.S. under a Biden administration program known as CBP One at risk of being targeted by the new ICE operation.",
      "While those placed in expedited removal can be deported without a hearing in immigration court, they are entitled to an interview with an asylum officer if they say they are afraid of being persecuted in their home country. If they pass those screenings, they get a chance to plead their case in immigration court.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin faulted the Biden administration for releasing many migrants with notices to appear in immigration court, instead of trying to deport them quickly through expedited removal.",
      "\"ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Leandro Ferrer, an immigration lawyer based in Phoenix, Arizona, said his clients, two Cuban migrants, appear to have been swept up in the ICE operation when they showed up to their immigration court hearing on Tuesday.",
      "\"There was a sense of relief when the government prosecutors moved to dismiss the removal proceedings,\" Ferrer recounted. \"This has always been, historically, a result that is highly sought after and either we try to win a case on the merits of an application or we try to dismiss the removal proceedings.\"",
      "But to his shock and dismay, Ferrer said ICE agents arrested his clients immediately after they left the courtroom.",
      "\"They did not provide identification, they did not have an arrest warrant, they did not make any attempt to establish whether or not they had committed a crime,\" Ferrer added. \"They just went in and took them.\"",
      "Ferrer said his Cuban clients entered the U.S. in 2022, after showing up to a legal entry point along the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to request asylum.",
      "Even amid ICE's efforts to arrest some migrants after they show up to court, immigration lawyers said they are still strongly advising their clients against missing their hearings, as failure to do so could be grounds for judges to issue a deportation order.",
      "The ICE arrests at immigration courts were reported across the country in several cities with large immigrant populations, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Miami.",
      "\"I began getting calls from family members of those getting arrested asking for help,\" said Antonio Ramos, a Miami-based immigration lawyer, adding that the phone calls began on Monday.",
      "Ramos said he's trying to make preparations for his clients who have upcoming court hearings.",
      "\"They're going to come to my office first, we are going to take them to court and we are not going to leave them alone for one second in the building,\" he said.",
      "\"People need to consult with an attorney before going to court, somebody that can take a look at the case, evaluate options and not a notary,\" Ramos added.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",
      "\"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern,\" Thornburg said, citing a \"seasonality analysis\" that the agency has been working on about the virus.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-allows-trump-to-fire-labor-board-members/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 17:23:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's request to halt lower court rulings voiding removals of members from two labor boards.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Trump to remove two members of federal independent labor boards while legal proceedings over their firings move forward.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration to pause a pair of lower court rulings that voided Mr. Trump's removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "\"Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents,\" the court said. \"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power. But we do not ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or MSPB falls within such a recognized exception; that question is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision.",
      "Kagan wrote in her dissent, \"Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, without a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from a classic independent agency\u2014a multi-member, bipartisan commission exercising regulatory power whose governing statute contains a for-cause provision. Yet now the President has discharged, concededly without cause, several such officers, including a member of the NLRB (Gwynne Wilcox) and a member of the MSPB (Cathy Harris). Today, this Court effectively blesses those deeds. I would not.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had already temporarily halted the decisions to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider Mr. Trump's emergency appeal. The order from the full court means Wilcox and Harris will remain out of their jobs while the challenge to their firings continues.",
      "Wilcox and Harris' employment statuses have ping-ponged since they were informed by the Trump administration earlier this year that they were removed from their respective roles. Wilcox had been appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed to a second five-year term in 2023. Harris was tapped by Biden to serve on the MSPB in 2022 for a seven-year term.",
      "Each official sued the Trump administration over their firings, arguing they violated the for-cause removal laws that limited the president's ability to oust them. Two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., agreed and voided the firings. The judges each said Wilcox and Harris could remain in their roles at their respective agencies while their litigation plays out.",
      "But a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit paused those decisions, allowing the president to fire Harris and Wilcox again. The two then asked the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider their cases, and it ruled 7-4 to put the district court decisions back in place, meaning Harris and Wilcox could return to their jobs while their challenges moved forward.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in and again allow Mr. Trump to oust Wilcox and Harris. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the request for emergency relief that the Constitution gives the president broad power to remove members of multimember boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" such as the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "He argued that a court violates Article II of the Constitution by ordering an executive officer who was removed by the president to be reinstated to their position.",
      "Sauer also argued that the NLRB and MSPB are not covered by an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "The Trump administration did not ask the Supreme Court to overturn that decision in its emergency request, but did suggest that it could consider whether to invalidate the for-cause removal restrictions governing members of the NLRB and MSPB as a violation of the separation of powers. It has, however, said that it would ask the Supreme Court to overrule the 1935 ruling after it receives full briefing and argument and find that it was wrongly decided.",
      "But lawyers for Harris and Wilcox each warned that the administration is asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the structure of numerous agencies, putting at risk the independence of entities like the Federal Reserve Board, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Trump had indicated that he would like to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who he appointed during his first term, writing on social media in April that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" But the president then walked back the suggestion, saying he has \"no intention\" of getting rid of the Fed chief.",
      "The Supreme Court, however, said the structure of the Federal Reserve Board is not threatened because it is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "But Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration and is representing Harris, wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president is simply being asked to follow binding precedent, just as his predecessors have done for 90 years.",
      "\"History disproves the government's assertion that the president will be irreparably harmed if he cannot remove Harris,\" he wrote. \"No other president in our lifetimes has ever attempted to violate for-cause removal statutes in this manner. The current chief executive is not being held to a different standard.\"",
      "Katyal also said the MPSB is covered by the exception set by the Supreme Court in its 1935 decision.",
      "\"The board is the easy case,\" he said. \"If the board's structure is not constitutional under Humphrey's Executor, nothing is.\"",
      "In a separate filing, a lawyer for Wilcox, Deepak Gupta, said the statute that lays out the parameters for firing NLRB members has been on the books for nearly 100 years, and no presidential administration until now has tried to remove a member of the board.",
      "\"Nevertheless, the government now claims that its need to remove Gwynne Wilcox is urgent \u2014 so urgent that it asks this court to override the en banc D.C. Circuit's denial of a stay, jettison a century of settled interbranch practice, and signal the overruling of bedrock precedents of this court that have engendered strong reliance interests. The better course is restraint,\" he wrote.",
      "Gupta disputed the Trump administration's claim that it needs emergency relief,, which would require the Supreme Court to \"upend decades of tradition to allow the president to remove an NLRB member for the first time now \u2014 before this court has even had the opportunity to reconsider its longstanding precedent.\"",
      "Beyond the seat on the NLRB that had been filled by Wilcox and Harris' position on the MSPB, there are still vacancies at both agencies that Mr. Trump can fill. But lawyers for both have argued the president's firings have hobbled the boards and stymied their ability to adjudicate labor and employment disputes.",
      "\"By depriving the board of the quorum it needs to carry out its appellate decision making, the president's illegal removal causes immediate harm to the workers, employers, and broader public who depend on it,\" Gupta wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping reshaping of the executive branch. He has fired top officials leading a swath of independent agencies and institutions, and gotten rid of independent agency watchdogs. His administration is moving to dismantle other federal entities and programs, sparking legal challenges.",

      "President Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine had carried out a large exchange of prisoners from their more than three-year war, while Ukrainian and Russian officials said the swap was ongoing but not yet complete. The details remained unconfirmed, but the swap appeared to be one of the few signs of any progress in international efforts to halt the fighting.",
      "\"A major prisoners swap was just completed between Russia and Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social platform. He said it would \"go into effect shortly,\" although it was not clear what that meant.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the details of the swap told The Associated Press that the exchange was ongoing Friday morning but had not finished. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense later confirmed that the swap was underway, saying the two countries had exchanged 270 prisoners of war and 120 civilians, and that the process would continue in the coming days, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Both Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported in recent days that a swap had been agreed for about 1,000 prisoners to be handed over by each side, but those overall figures were not confirmed by either government on Friday.",
      "Shamsail Saraliev, a senior Russian lawmaker and representative of the parliamentary coordination group on military operations, told the country's RBC\u00a0news agency on Thursday that it would be difficult to conduct a prisoner exchange with Ukraine involving as many as 2,000 prisoners in total in just a day, saying the process would likely take several days.",
      "\"This could lead to something big???\" Mr. Trump said in his post on Friday, apparently referring to international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting. White House and National Security Council officials did not immediately respond to requests for further details.",

    "summary": "Ten people accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint\u200b were given the last word in their trial in Paris before the jury retired to consider its verdict.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 After a month-long trial, the ten people accused of robbing billionaire celebrity Kim Kardashian were given the last word in the final session of their trial on Friday before the jury retired to consider its verdict. The man accused of being the brains behind the $10 million jewelry heist in 2016 offered \"a thousand apologies\" in a scribbled note to the court.",
      "Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, 69, is now deaf and largely mute. Prosecutors have called for him to be sentenced to 10 years in prison.",
      "Nine men and one woman have been on trial for their involvement in the brazen armed robbery, facing charges including robbery and kidnapping. The gang was dubbed \"the Grandpa Robbers\" by French media because most were in their 60s at the time of the heist.",
      "Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week in October 2016, staying in a discreet hotel in the center of the city. In emotional four-and-a-half-hour testimony 10 days ago, she told the Paris court she \"absolutely\" believed she was going to be \"raped and killed\" when one of the armed, masked robbers grabbed her leg and pulled her toward him as she lay on her bed wearing just a bathrobe.",
      "She was bound with zip ties and duct tape and locked in the bathroom while the robbers searched her room for the expensive jewelry they said they had seen on social media posts by the woman they recognized only as \"the rapper's wife\" \u2014 a reference to her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "During the final session on Friday, the two accused whose DNA was recovered from the scene of the crime, both of whom have admitted to their parts in the robbery, apologized to Kardashian and the court.",
      "Yunis Abbas, 71, who had already apologized directly to Kardashian for contributing to the trauma she said she lives with daily, told the court: \"All I have to say is to apologize to you again; I'm sorry for what I may have done.\"",
      "He was suspected of being the lookout for the gang, stationed outside the luxury residence known as the No Name hotel.",
      "Khedache, in his scribbled note, also apologized to his son. Harminy A\u00eft Khedache, 38, was accused of being a driver for the gang that night. He faces eight years in prison if convicted.",
      "Investigators only found DNA from two of the accused, and in court on Friday, the other eight took to the witness stand to reiterate their claims that they had nothing to do with the crime.",
      "The prosecution has called for 10-year sentences against the four men charged with directly participating in the armed robbery \u2014 Khedache, Abbas, Didier Dubreucq, 70, and the youngest of the accused, Marc-Alexandre Boyer, 35.",
      "The prosecutor said in court that they were \"experienced robbers who came up with a plan and succeeded.\"",
      "Florus Heroui, 52, a Parisian bar manager, and Gary Madar, 36, brother of Kardashian's regular Paris chauffeur and a waiter, who allegedly fed tips to the gang, both face possible seven-year sentences if convicted.",
      "The only woman on trial, Christiane Glotin, 79, a former companion of the senior Khedache, was accused of being the gang's \"secretary,\" taking care of logistics. The prosecution has called for to receive a six-year sentence.",
      "The prosecution called for Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte, who is charged with being an accomplice, to be sentenced to four years in prison, with two of them suspended, and for Marc Boyer, who's charged with illegal possession of a weapon, to be fined about $23,000. He is the father of Marc-Alexandre Boyer.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 08:45:54 -0400",
    "summary": "As Trump moves to ban foreign students from enrolling at Harvard, at least one university in China says applicants are welcome to come there instead.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban international students from Harvard would harm America's international standing, and one university in Hong Kong looked to capitalize on the uncertainty by promising to take them in. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard University's international student population. The university enrolled 6,703 international students across all of its schools in 2024, according to the school's data, or about a quarter of the overall student body, with 1,203 of those coming from China.",
      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting that Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\"But with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\" the CCTV commentary said. It went on to say that it becomes necessary for international students to consider other options \"when policy uncertainty becomes the norm.\"",
      "Educational cooperation with the U.S. is mutually beneficial and China opposes its politicization, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "\"The relevant actions by the U.S. side will only damage its own image and international credibility,\" she said.",
      "She added that China would firmly protect the rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars abroad but she didn't offer any details on how it would do so in this situation.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem accused Harvard this week of \"fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\"",
      "She said the administration's action against the renowned university would \"serve as a warning\" to other colleges.",
      "Last month, CBS Boston reported that Noem had demanded detailed records on the purported \"illegal and violent activities\" of Harvard's foreign student visa holders.",
      "\"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,\" Noem said in a statement. \"Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Harvard has become \"a hotbed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators.\"",
      "\"They have repeatedly failed to take action to address the widespread problems negatively impacting American students and now they must face the consequences of their actions,\" Jackson said in the statement.",
      "Harvard has called the administration's move unlawful, and in a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, the university said the government's action violated the First Amendment and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard said in its suit. The school said it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move.",
      "\"We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University \u2014 and this nation \u2014 immeasurably,\" a spokesperson for the university said in a statement released on Thursday. \"We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community.\"",
      "CBS Boston reported that panic was quickly setting in for some of Harvard's incoming foreign students, who have been left scrambling to find other university options and make new plans ahead of the autumn term. Already, at least one Chinese university is publicly looking to help meet their needs.",
      "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology extended an open invitation to international students already at Harvard and those who have been admitted. The institution posted a news release saying it would provide unconditional offers, streamlined admission procedures and academic support to facilitate a seamless transition.",
      "Some people in China joked online about having the university open a branch in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin, whose name shares the same character as Harvard's name in Chinese.",
      "The issue of Chinese students studying overseas has long been a point of tension in the relationship with the United States. During Mr. Trump's first term, China's Ministry of Education warned students about rising rejections rates and shorter terms for visas in the U.S.",
      "Last year, the Chinese foreign ministry protested that a number of Chinese students had been interrogated and sent home upon arrival at U.S. airports.",
      "China's state media outlets have long played up gun violence in the U.S. and portrayed America as a dangerous place. Some Chinese students are opting to study in the U.K. or other countries rather than the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vented fury at his own military and other officials Wednesday after his country's second naval destroyer was damaged in a failed launch that he was there to witness, state media reported Thursday. Kim wants bigger warships to deal with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country, amid a long-simmering standoff over his nuclear weapons.",
      "It is uncommon for North Korea to acknowledge military-related setbacks or accidents, and observers say the disclosure of the failed ship launch suggests Kim is serious about his naval advancement program and confident of ultimately achieving that objective.",
      "During a launching event at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, the newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer became unbalanced and was punctured in its bottom sections after a transport cradle on the stern section slid off first and became stuck, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. KCNA didn't provide details on what caused the problem, the severity of the damage or whether anyone was injured.",
      "According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim called for a ruling Workers' Party meeting slated for late June to address their \"irresponsible errors.\"",
      "\"It's a shameful thing. But the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build\" a greater navy, said Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul's Hanyang University.",
      "Moon suspected the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and were rushed to put it in the water.",
      "The damaged vessel was likely the same class as the country's first destroyer unveiled last month, which experts assessed as North Korea's largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim called the first vessel, named Choe Hyon \u2014 a famed Korean guerilla fighter during the Japanese colonial period \u2014 a significant asset for advancing his goal of expanding the military's operational range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year and later supervised test-firings of missiles from the warship.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the damaged vessel was likely equipped with similar systems and remains toppled over in the sea. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC appeared to show the vessel rolled onto its side, positioned diagonally from the dock, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.",
      "Earlier commercial satellite images indicated that the country was building its second destroyer at a shipyard in Chongjin.",
      "Beyond Parallel, a website run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the satellite imagery of Chongjin's Hambuk shipyard on May 12 showed that a second vessel in the Choe Hyon-class of guided missile destroyers was under construction.",
      "A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has been rarely used in North Korea. The report said the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the Choe Hyon destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries' military partnerships are booming. North Korea has provided Russia's Vladimir Putin with equipment and even soldiers to aid in his ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.",
      "While North Korea's naval forces are considered far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say the destroyer with nuclear-capable missiles and an advanced radar system would still enhance the North's offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North's advancing nuclear program. In April, the U.S. military flew long-range B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula in joint exercise with the South, in a show of force against North Korea days after Kim's powerful sister vowed to resist a U.S.-led push to eliminate the Pyongyang's nuclear program",

      "Jenin, West Bank\u00a0\u2014 Several nations that have backed Israel during its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip voiced outrage Wednesday after Israeli troops fired what they called \"warning shots\" as foreign diplomats visited the occupied West Bank.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, accused Israeli troops of \"deliberately\" shooting at the delegation near the flashpoint city of Jenin. The Israeli military, already under pressure over its tactics in the Gaza war, said it regretted the \"inconvenience.\"",
      "AFP video from Jenin \u2014 a frequent target of Israeli military raids \u2014 showed the delegation and accompanying journalists running for cover as shots were heard on Wednesday.",
      "A European diplomat said the envoys went to the area to see the destruction caused in the West Bank by Israeli military raids during the Gaza war, which was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the diplomatic convoy had strayed from the approved route and entered a restricted zone, prompting troops to fire \"warning shots\" to steer the group away. The IDF added that no one was wounded and it expressed regret for the \"inconvenience caused.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman called the incident \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"Diplomats who are doing their work should never be shot at, attacked in any way, shape or form. Their safety, their viability, must be respected at all times,\" spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. \"These diplomats, including U.N. personnel, were fired at, warning shots or whatever... which is unacceptable.\"",
      "Demands for explanation over Israel's \"unacceptable\" actions",
      "Several countries that had representatives in the group voiced outrage and demanded an investigation.",

      "Israel-Europe ties increasingly strained over Gaza, D.C. murders",
      "The incident came as anger mounted over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Palestinians are scrambling for basic supplies after weeks of near-total isolation. A two-month Israeli aid blockade on Gaza was partially eased this week, but not enough to alleviate the hunger crisis facing the enclave's roughly 2 million inhabitants, according to the U.N. and humanitarian agencies.",

    "summary": "President Trump has singled out White Afrikaner farmers for U.S. refugee status, claiming they're persecuted in South Africa. But most people there say it's simply not true.",
    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",

      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"",
      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",

    "story": [
      "The United States and Italy signed a pact to bolster efforts to recover the remains of American soldiers who went missing in action during World War II, officials announced Tuesday.",
      "The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) \u2014 the U.S. agency tasked with identifying fallen service members \u2014 and Italy's culture ministry signed a deal to improve operations to locate and recover the remains of fallen military members who were never accounted for in Italy. The memorandum also establishes the protection of archaeological sites involved in the search efforts, Italian officials said in a statement.",
      "The Italian peninsula was the site of intense battles from 1943 to 1945, following the Allied invasion of Sicily and the campaign to liberate Italy from Nazi forces.",
      "It's difficult to pinpoint how many missing U.S. soldiers were killed in Italy\u00a0during World War II, but roughly 72,000 American servicemembers remain unaccounted for from the war around the world, according to DPAA. The remains of nearly 1,000 Americans who died in World War II have been identified since recovery efforts were renewed in the 1970s.",
      "Forensic experts at DPAA spend years using DNA, dental records, sinus records and chest X-rays to identify the remains of service members killed in combat.",
      "Earlier this year, a 23-year-old U.S. soldier who went missing in action during an aquatic mission in Italy during World War II was accounted for.",
      "The new agreement to recover remains of fallen soldiers in Italy was signed Tuesday by Luigi La Rocca, the head of Italy's Department for Heritage Protection, and Kelly McKeague, the director of DPAA.",
      "\"The right to research and remember those dead during the war is now combined with the protection of the archaeological heritage for which the ministry of culture is responsible,\" Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli said Tuesday.",
      "Giuli said the agreement was a further step in \"our decade-long cooperation with the U.S. agency for prisoners of war and missing in action, as a tribute to those who sacrificed their lives to contribute to our freedom.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" U.S. missile defense system undermine \"global strategic balance and stability,\" and should be abandoned, China says.",
    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system like Israel's Iron Dome.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

The bill would add genetic information to the definition of \"personally identifiable information\" in the bankruptcy code.",

      "Under current law, the bankruptcy code provides protections for personally identifiable information in bankruptcy court proceedings to prevent the possibility of identity theft, harm or other unlawful injury.",
      "Senate aides told Fox News Digital the current definition of personally identifiable information includes an individual's name, address, email, phone number, Social Security number, credit card numbers and other information that could be used for identification purposes.",
      "Those aides said the definition is \"outdated\" and does not include a reference to genetic information, leaving the information vulnerable.",

      "\"This legislation would solve this problem by updating the definition of \u2018personally identifiable information\u2019 in the bankruptcy code to include genetic information,\" a Senate aide said.",
      "The bill also addresses consumer privacy concerns by having consumers affirmatively consent to the sale or lease of their genetic information after a bankruptcy case commences and requiring companies to provide prior written notice of the use, sale or lease of their genetic information during bankruptcy.",
      "The bill also requires the trustee or debtor in possession to delete any genetic information not subject to a sale or lease.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas (Reuters)",
      "\"Advances in DNA testing have allowed Americans to have unprecedented access to important insights about their genetics, but these companies must have a plan to protect this data in the event of bankruptcy,\" Cornyn told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"By updating the bankruptcy code, this legislation would safeguard Americans\u2019 sensitive genetic information to ensure it cannot be weaponized against them or made public without their knowledge and consent.\"",

      "And Klobuchar said companies \"have profited off of Americans\u2019 data while consumers have been left in the dark, which is especially concerning in light of reports that 23andMe plans to sell customer genetic data assets to a large pharmaceutical company.\"",
      "\"This bill will put new protections in place to safeguard Americans\u2019 privacy while giving consumers greater control over how their sensitive health data is shared,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "Grassley told Fox News Digital consumers should \"feel confident that any personal information shared with a public company isn't up for grabs when that company files for bankruptcy.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. (Screenshot/ABC/TheView)",

      "The pharmaceutical company said it won the court-supervised auction of the genetic testing company, with Regeneron agreeing to pay $256 million for the assets. The auction for 23andMe was part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection it filed in March to arrange a sale of its business.",
      "In its bankruptcy petition, the company estimated a range of $100 million to $500 million for its assets. Estimated liabilities were the same.",

They are sons and daughters, neighbors, classmates and Virginians who deserve equal protection and opportunity under the law.\"",
      "The controversy began in 2020 when TJHSST made changes to its admissions policies to sensibly promote diversity.

      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system.

Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial.

      "Why are scam ads so widespread?",
      "The problem of\u00a0scam ads on Facebook has grown rapidly in recent years. Experts point to the rise of\u00a0cryptocurrency schemes,\u00a0AI-generated content and\u00a0organized criminal groups operating from Southeast Asia. These scams range from fake investment opportunities to misleading product offers and even the sale of nonexistent puppies.",

A spokesperson described the situation as an\u00a0\"epidemic of scams\" and insisted that Meta is taking aggressive action, removing more than 2 million accounts linked to scam centers in several countries this year alone.",
      "However, insiders tell a different story. Current and former Meta employees say the company has been reluctant to make it harder for advertisers to buy ads, fearing it could hurt the company's bottom line. Staff reportedly tolerated between eight and 32 fraud \"strikes\" before banning accounts and scam enforcement was deprioritized to avoid losing ad revenue.",

In court filings, Meta has argued that it\u00a0\"does not owe a duty to users\" when it comes to policing fraud.

      "How to protect yourself from scam ads",
      "Staying safe online takes a little extra effort, but it's well worth it. Here are some steps you can follow to avoid falling victim to scam ads.",
      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public.

Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed.

      "If you live in one of these states, you now have a much stronger legal footing to demand that people-search sites remove your information. Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 16:07:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that healthcare information of more than 430,000 Ascension patients was exposed in a data breach.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",
      "We reached out to Ascension for a comment on our article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "Ways to protect yourself after the Ascension data breach",
      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

Open Bionics aims to make their devices more affordable than traditional options, with some of their earlier models reportedly costing about five times less than conventional robotic prosthetics. However, the exact price for the latest models, including the Hero PRO, will depend on factors like insurance coverage, customization and specific user requirements.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",

      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",
      "SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

It could help with emergency rescues, maintaining electrical infrastructure or cleaning skyscrapers. It also has the potential for sightseeing and leisure flights, and it could be used for border patrol or customs inspections. With its versatility and easy controls, this aircraft could be a game changer for both professionals and adventure seekers.",
      "However, there is currently no official information on the commercial availability or price of Zhiyuan's tri-ducted wearable eVTOL. The aircraft has completed its first public demonstration, but details about when it will be available for purchase and at what cost remain undisclosed.",

      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.",

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",

      "Segal told Fox News Digital that the ADL has observed anti-Israel language becoming \"more militant\" and moving away from criticisms of the Israeli government and its policies, which he said are not antisemitic.

      "\"The concern that many in the Jewish community have when they hear phrases like \u2018globalize the intifada\u2019 is that it reminds them of the intifadas that occurred, right, which were violent,\" Segal told Fox News Digital. \u00a0\"They featured suicide bombings, a lot of death and destruction. So, when you call for the globalization of an intifada, many people hear that as calling for the globalization for violence against Jews.\"",

      "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened imports from the European Union with a sweeping 50% tariff, posting online that trade talks with the bloc are \"going nowhere.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that he was \"recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\" That rate would be higher than the 39% Trump promised to hit the bloc with on April 2's so-called Liberation Day.",
      "Just minutes earlier, Trump had also threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if it does not start producing iPhones in the United States \u2014 an outcome industry experts broadly see as a nonstarter. \"The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale,\" prominent tech analyst Dan Ives said in response to Trump's threat Friday.",
      "The early morning posts risked reigniting the trade war Trump started in April that had cooled down in recent weeks. His administration had been speaking positively about ongoing trade talks, even though it has so far secured few concrete economic wins. The president has backed down from some of his most severe tariffs, sparking a comeback for U.S. and global markets.",
      "That rebound looked poised to reverse after Trump\u2019s posts, with stock indexes in Germany, France and Italy each dropping nearly 3%. The Stoxx 600, which tracks hundreds of stocks across Europe, plunged more than 2%. Shares in the United Kingdom dropped more than 1%, even though it is not a member of the E.U.",
      "U.S. stocks opened sharply lower, but as of 11 a.m. ET they were off their worst levels, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% and Nasdaq Composite down 1%. The Dow was lower by 280 points or 0.7%.",
      "A number of companies with major U.S. and E.U. operations also saw their shares fall. Deutsche Bank shares plunged 4%, carmakers BMW and Stellantis, the maker of Jeep trucks, dropped 3.5%, and tech giant SAP fell 2%. Cosmetics firm L'Oreal also dropped more than 2%, and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH dropped 3%.",
      "Trump has repeatedly assailed the European Union, calling it \u201cin many ways, nastier than China.\" On tariff rates and what the U.S. calls \"non-tariff barriers,\" Trump has said, \"They'll come down a lot. You watch.\" But the bloc has refused to alter its value-added tax, a frequent point of contention for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other U.S. officials.",
      "Speaking on CNBC shortly after Trump's social media posts, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted, \"10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.\"",
      "Goolsbee added that it would be \"really scary for the supply chain\" if businesses in his Midwest district, which includes auto hub Detroit, would see tariff rates as high as 50%.",
      "The E.U. bloc is America's second-biggest trading partner behind China. The United States exported more than $350 billion of goods to the 27-nation bloc in recent years and imported $550 billion worth of goods.",
      "Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Commission's trade chief, is set to speak by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Friday morning, just hours after Trump's post.",
      "The E.U. has been bracing itself for months for the possibility that trade talks with the U.S. would fail. In early May, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the bloc preferred negotiations, \"but not at any cost. We therefore continue to prepare for every scenario.\" The following day, the E.U. announced more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"With the exception of the E.U., most [countries] are negotiating in very good faith,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday morning on Fox News. \"I would hope that this would light a fire under the E.U.\"",
      "In 2024, pharmaceutical products were the E.U.'s top export to the U.S., with more than $90 billion crossing the Atlantic, followed by more than $45 billion of vehicles and automotive products. The U.S. also imported more than $300 billion of E.U. services. Telecom, information technology and scientific services were the top imports."

      "\u201cNo one could say a bad word about him he was just a beautiful beautiful guy,\" Lionel Conway, a friend of Shaipro's, told the TODAY Show on Friday."

      "PITTSBURGH \u2014 The Pittsburgh Pirates are reeling, and just about everything is on the table for a last-place team that has already fired its manager and packed a half-decade's worth of public-relations missteps into two months.",
      "Well, except for one thing: trading ace Paul Skenes.",
      "Asked on Thursday if flipping the reigning National League Rookie of the Year is a consideration for a club woefully lacking in impactful position-player prospects, general manager Ben Cherington gave an atypically brief response.",
      "\"No, it's not part of the conversation at all,\" Cherington said flatly.",
      "Pittsburgh entered a four-game series against NL Central rival Milwaukee already 11 games out of playoff position, thanks in large part to an offense that ranks last or next-to-last in nearly every major category: from runs, slugging percentage and OPS (all 30th) to home runs and batting average (both 29th).",
      "The Pirates at least showed a small flicker of life at the plate in an 8-5 loss to the Brewers a few hours after Cherington spoke, scoring five runs for the first time in 27 games. Their 26-game streak of four runs or fewer tied a major league record set by four other teams, most recently the then-California Angels in 1969.",
      "Yet it was telling that Pittsburgh also left 10 runners on base, typical of a season in which the Pirates have consistently been unable to take advantage of what few opportunities they create.",
      "Not exactly what the team had in mind during spring training, when everyone from Cherington to Skenes to manager Derek Shelton \u2014 who was jettisoned two weeks ago and replaced by Don Kelly \u2014 talked about the need for Pittsburgh to take another step forward after consecutive 76-86 seasons.",
      "Instead, the Pirates have been stuck in reverse from opening day, even when Skenes starts. Pittsburgh is just 3-5 in his eight starts, the latest loss a 1-0 setback in Philadelphia last weekend in which Skenes limited the Phillies to three hits while throwing the first complete game of his career.",
      "Skenes, who turns 23 next week, has been all-in on the Pirates since being called up a year ago. He's also under team control for the rest of the decade and won't become arbitration-eligible until after 2026, making him one of the biggest bargains in the majors.",
      "While Pittsburgh has locked down players like two-time All-Star outfielder Bryan Reynolds and third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes to long-term deals, they are a pittance by MLB standards compared to what Skenes might command one day should his career continue on its current trajectory.",
      "The Pirates are perennially one of the most frugal teams in the majors. Their opening day payroll this season was just under $88 million. Only the Chicago White Sox, Tampa Bay, the Athletics and Miami spent less.",
      "Even so, Pittsburgh has received little return on its investment. While the bullpen has been a bit of a mess, the starting rotation has been solid. Skenes (2.44), Mitch Keller (3.88), Andrew Heaney (2.91) and Bailey Falter (3.50) all have ERAs under 4.00, yet they also have a combined record of 11-21.",
      "The issue has been a punchless lineup that is largely nondescript outside of Reynolds, franchise icon Andrew McCutchen and center fielder Oneil Cruz.",
      "Pittsburgh has one of the deeper pools of pitching prospects in the majors \u2014 a list that includes hard-throwing 22-year-old Bubba Chandler and Mike Burrows, who gave up four runs over five innings Thursday in his first major league start \u2014 but the cupboard of homegrown position players who are on the cusp of the big leagues remains pretty bare five-plus years into Cherington's tenure.",
      "Catcher Henry Davis, the top overall pick in the 2021 draft, remains a work in progress nearly two full years after his major league debut. Second baseman Nick Gonzales, a first-rounder in 2020, is recovering from an ankle injury and has yet to establish himself as an everyday player. Former first-round picks Termarr Johnson (2022) and Konnor Griffin (2024) are still years away.",
      "So far, the only callups from Triple-A have been mostly injury-related, not performance-related.",
      "\"We want guys from Triple-A to pound the door down,\" Cherington said. \"That would be good. I still think that can happen this year. We want more of it over time. ... Everybody knows we've got to score more runs. That's not going to happen just by saying it and hoping for it. You've got to do the work to do it.\"",
      "Cherington remains optimistic that the major league team will start to turn the corner over the final 110ish games, and he's certain Skenes will be a part of it no matter which way it goes.",
      "\"We've just got to get better,\" Cherington said. \"Let's play better baseball, and that's going to lead to winning more games. Then, let's wake up and see where that takes us when we get to July.\""

(Challenged by another guest on his show about that, Rogan said: \u201dI didn\u2019t bring him on for that purpose. I brought him on because I want to find out, like, how does one get involved in the whole conspiracy theory business? Because his whole thing is just conspiracies.\u201d)",
      "Segal said: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that words animate violence, and the demonization of Israelis and Jews, along with the constant glorification of terrorist organizations, has created the environment that we\u2019re in, making such tragedies like yesterday more likely.\u201d",
      "And for the radicalized who are tired of living in obscurity, carrying out an attack is a guaranteed way to gain attention.",

      "U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted the temporary restraining order after the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday terminated the university\u2019s international student certification. The move barred the school from not only admitting international students, but also ordering current foreign-born students to transfer or lose their legal status.",
      "Under the order, international students can remain enrolled at the school. The next hearing for the case will take place next week.",

      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that \"Harvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment.\"",

      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Alan M. Garber, Harvard\u2019s president, said Friday in a letter to the university's community. \"It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.\"",

      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that he was \"recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\" That rate would be higher than the 39% Trump promised to hit the bloc with on April 2's so-called Liberation Day.",
      "Just minutes earlier, Trump had also threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if it does not start producing iPhones in the United States \u2014 an outcome industry experts broadly see as a nonstarter. \"The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale,\" prominent tech analyst Dan Ives said in response to Trump's threat Friday.",

You watch.\" But the bloc has refused to alter its value-added tax, a frequent point of contention for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other U.S. officials.",
      "Speaking on CNBC shortly after Trump's social media posts, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted, \"10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.\"",
      "Goolsbee added that it would be \"really scary for the supply chain\" if businesses in his Midwest district, which includes auto hub Detroit, would see tariff rates as high as 50%.",

      "The historic unit dispatched to the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, was inaugurated Thursday by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said during a military ceremony in the city that \u201cthe security of our Baltic allies is also our security.\u201d",
      "The groundbreaking German military decision is perhaps the most significant in a steady stream of moves by European nations to bolster defenses on NATO\u2019s eastern flank amid persistent security threats from Russia and President Donald Trump's insistence that Europe does more both to defend itself and pay for that defense.",
      "It also comes despite persistent efforts by the Trump administration to bring to an end the Kremlin's three-year-long war in Ukraine.",
      "Among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, the three Baltic nations of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia \u2014 linked to NATO\u2019s main territory only by a narrow corridor that stretches between Russia and its staunch ally Belarus known as the Suwalki Gap \u2014 are perhaps the most vulnerable to an expanded Russian assault.",
      "On Thursday, Merz said that \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive revisionism\u201d since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 meant it could seek to redraw the broader map of Europe and not just that of Ukraine.",
      "Standing alongside Merz, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da added that Russia and Belarus had already begun conducting military exercises on his country\u2019s border.",
      "The new German brigade on NATO\u2019s eastern flank will comprise a heavy combat unit of some 4,800 soldiers, hundreds of civilian staff, and 2,000 vehicles, including tanks. It will be headquartered in Rudninkai near Vilnius and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2027.",
      "\u201cAnyone who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will jointly defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d Merz said.",
      "Trump has been putting pressure on America's NATO allies to increase their military spending, previously accusing Germany and other European countries of \u201cfreeloading\u201d at Washington\u2019s expense and even going as far as implementing a temporary pause on military aid to Ukraine in March this year.",
      "It also marks a shift away from America's guarantee of European security against Russia that has been in place since World War II which has yielded U.S. hard and soft power throughout the continent and beyond.",
      "After his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election in February, Merz said his \u201cabsolute priority\u201d was \u201cstrengthening Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.\u201d",
      "In line with Germany, other European front-line countries have begun upping spending in order to fortify their borders against Russia and Belarus. Earlier this month, Lithuania announced it would spend around $1.2 billion on its military, raising it to 6% of its annual gross domestic product.",

      "\u201cFear Street: Prom Queen\" takes audiences back to the '80s for a prom night that goes from bodacious to, well, filled with bodies.",
      "The newest installment to the \"Fear Street\" franchise follows outsider Lori Granger (India Fowler) as she runs for her high school's prom queen, going up against popular girl Tiffany Falconer (Fina Strazza) and her friends.",
      "But on prom night, each girl nominated is picked off one by one, slasher style, by a serial killer.",
      "Eventually, Tiffany's dad (Chris Klein) is revealed to be the killer \u2014 one of them, at least. After the big reveal, the police take a shocked Tiffany and Lori home as Mrs. Falconer (Katherine Waterston) stays to answer more questions. Tiffany asks Lori to come inside as she doesn't want to be alone, and Lori obliges.",
      "But when Mrs. Falconer eventually gets home, she pulls out a knife and begins chasing both girls around the house. They hide in a closet as Tiffany freaks out over her parents both being psychotic killers.",
      "But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Tiffany soon pulls out a knife and tries to kill Lori herself, revealing the final twist: All three Falconers were in on it together.",
      "Fina Strazza, who plays Tiffany in the film, tells TODAY.com that this ending wasn't initially in the script. At first, her character was completely innocent.",
      "\"The original version I read, Tiffany was not involved at all, and it was just the parents,\" she says. \"In the scene that I was doing for my audition,\u00a0she was just crying, and was like, 'Mom, how could you do this?'\"",
      "Then, in the final audition over Zoom, casting director Carmen Cuba and director Matt Palmer decided to test another layer to her character. They asked Strazza to improvise the scene as if she were the killer.",
      "\"I was a little bit put on the spot,\" she admits. \"I was a little nervous about that, because that\u2019s a big responsibility to take on in just one moment.\"",
      "\"I did a little something, and afterwards, Matt and Carmen were like, 'Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s kind of cool?' I was like, 'Yeah, it was awesome.' I guess it worked,\" she says. \"It landed me the part.\"",
      "Strazza says she's \"always loved horror movies\" and \"always wanted to play a killer.\"",
      "Strazza's co-star India Fowler, who played Lori Granger in the film, tells TODAY.com she has mixed feelings on the movie's ending. Part of her \"loves\" it because it's so \"shocking,\" but another part wishes the original ending could have made the cut. She says that part of her would have liked to see Tiffany and Lori form a friendship ... or even more.",
      "\"There's another side of me, which sort of thinks that Tiffany and Lori, there's a secret love affair going on,\" she says. \"And so, I have this kind of inward dream that there's a universe where Tiffany is innocent and actually she's expressing her love for Lori in a weird way.\"",
      "Fowler adds that Strazza was not alone in being directed to improvise certain moments. For the teens' dance battle, Strazza was taught classic '80s choreography, but Fowler was asked to improvise.",
      "\"Matt (Palmer) thought it was important that Lori didn't have any form of choreography,\" Fowler says. \"They really just said, 'Feel free to just be free and dance' ... That was just left up to me, which I quite liked.\""

Guests enter a lift and soon after the ride begins, they are greeted by Harry, Ron and Hermione, all of whom are on their way to see Umbridge\u2019s trial. However, things take a turn when Umbridge escapes, and a quest to stop her before she does permanent damage ensues.",

      "Perhaps the most notable room is Umbridge\u2019s regal office, where her belongings are scattered or thrown into packing boxes. Her house elf, Higgledy, sits atop her furniture \u2014 and it\u2019s certainly not the last you see of her.",
      "The lift and ride premise",
      "Once visitors arrive at the end of the queue, there are several lifts with two rows of seats awaiting guests.",

However, a turn of events unfold as Umbridge escapes and a Death Eater comes to her aid. The rest of the journey sees the trio of best friends fight to capture Umbridge  and make sure justice is served.",

      "\u201cThe Mormon culture,\" she continued, \"is very much, like, we want our kids to be good kids and to not get into trouble and to not explore different things that could lead them in troubled areas,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSo I feel like a lot of parents put their kids in something and then push it hard,\" she added.",
      "Lindsay Arnold began ballroom dancing as a child and competed on \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d in 2012 before appearing as a pro dancer on \u201cDWTS\u201d from 2013 until 2022.",
      "She described Utah\u2019s dance culture as \u201cvery intense in the best way.\u201d",
      "\"There\u2019s been so many of us (from Utah) that have kind of paved the way that these dancers and parents see what\u2019s possible,\" she said. \"So they\u2019re more willing to put (in) money, time. Because dance is a full-on investment.\u201d",
      "The Arnold sisters are just two of many \"DWTS\" dancers with connections to the Mormon community. The list also includes Witney Carson, Jenna Johnson, Ezra Sosa and siblings Julianna Hough and Derek Hough.",
      "During an appearance on the \u201cLightweights\u201d podcast in October 2024, \"DWTS\" pro Brandon Armstrong, who was raised Mormon in Napa, California, before relocating to Utah as a tween, shared why he thinks young people in Utah flock to ballroom dancing.",
      "\"There\u2019s nothing else to do,\u201d joked Armstrong. \u201cWhat else do you do in Utah? Come on, our biggest cities, like Salt Lake, there ain\u2019t nothing there.",
      "He added, \"You play sports, go to school, date super young \u2014 these guys get married when they\u2019re 19, 20 years old \u2014 and then you dance.\u201d"

    "summary": "Julianne Moore unpacks the ending to Netflix's \"Sirens\" and why she thinks her character Michaela winds up in a \"good place.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Sirens.\"",
      "Is Michaela Kell's mysterious lifestyle really a cult? The question that loomed over the five episodes of Netflix's \"Sirens\" is finally answered in the finale, which premiered on May 22.",
      "The resolution of an explosive weekend on a lavish New England island leaves no character unscathed, as the lives of the people in Michaela's orbit are completely upended.",
      "Julianne Moore, who stars as Michaela in the series, tells TODAY.com the series started as a look at the Greek myth of sirens \u2014 winged creatures, half-birds and half-women, with songlike voices capable of luring sailors at sea to their demise.",
      "\u201cWhy do we hear about the sirens from this perspective? We always hear about it from the sailors\u2019 perspectives, not from the sirens\u2019 perspective,\u201d Moore says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, what are the sirens asking for? And in fact, why are they responsible and not the men?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men are always saying, \u2018These women lured me in. These women made me crash my ship. These women made me throw my life away.\u2019 Suddenly, these men have no agency. They have no autonomy,\u201d she adds.",
      "Moore says it was the daughter of the series\u2019 showrunner, Molly Smith Metzler, who asked her mom the questions about Greek sirens that led her to write the play the series is based on.",
      "\u201cI think Molly wanted to incorporate that idea into the show, this idea of, \u2018What\u2019s their story?\u2019\u201d Moore says.",
      "What is 'Sirens' about?",
      "The five-episode Netflix series also stars Meghann Fahy as Devon, who travels to the island after being unable to reach her sister Simone, played by Milly Alcock, who is employed as Michaela's assistant.",
      "Devon's arrival on the island causes utter chaos in Michaela's perfectly precise and planned out life. The final episode starts at the end of the whirlwind weekend, as Michaela's annual gala is just beginning.",
      "Michaela has been preparing for the event with beloved assistant Simone by her side for months, but the party gets upended when Michaela decides to fire her hours before it's set to begin. The socialite discovered that her husband, Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), kissed Simone \u2014 and had photographic evidence to prove his infidelity.",
      "While Simone insisted Peter came on to her and that she walked away after the kiss, the discovery came after Michaela found out Simone had been lying to her about her secret relationship with Peter's best friend Ethan (Glenn Howerton).",
      "Simone and Ethan did go public with their relationship earlier in the season, leading him to propose to her, but Simone turned him down. After the rejection, Ethan began to spiral, and he fell off of a cliff while fighting with Simone.",
      "How does 'Sirens' end?",
      "The beginning of Episode 5 starts with Ethan recovering in the hospital, and when he sees Simone in the room, he starts screaming and telling her to get out. Kevin sticks up for Simone, telling Ethan he needs to respect her.",
      "Moore says the series represents a push-and-pull of power dynamics between men and women. While it may look like Michaela is calling the shots, it\u2019s really Peter who is pulling the strings all along.",
      "\u201cPeter Kell has all the power because he has all the money, and this is very much about social and economic hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you really peel it back, you realize the person making the decisions, if you go all the way up, is that billionaire.\u201d",
      "After Peter asks Michaela why she fired Simone, he sees Simone running down to the beach. He follows her, and he tells her that the end of her employment was his fault and that he would fix it. She says she has to tell him something, but the scene cuts away.",
      "The gala is in full swing back at the house as Devon confronts Michaela about the rumors she's a cult leader \u2014 and that she killed Peter's first wife \u2014 in front of all of the guests. Michaela shares that after Peter's divorce, his ex-wife had botched plastic surgery and became a recluse, shutting down all of the town gossip.",
      "After the confrontation, Peter approaches Michaela and asks to talk to her in private. He then tells her he wants a divorce after he claims she kept him from his children from his previous marriage. He also reveals that he had found the photo of him and Simone \u2014 and destroyed it.",
      "Moore says she thinks Devon's arrival on the island may have ignited the tension between Michaela and Peter, but adds their marriage was doomed no matter what.",
      "\"I think it was inevitable,\" Moore says. \"I think these kind of situations, particularly in marriages, if that\u2019s gonna happen, that\u2019s gonna happen. So it\u2019s not like Devon not coming would have changed anything. I think there would have been the same result.\"",
      "After Michaela storms out of the room, Simone walks down a set of stairs wearing an evening gown. Peter extends his hand, and walks her out \u2014 signaling that what they talked about down at the beach was starting a real relationship.",
      "As they walk into the gala, Simone sees Devon and fills her in that she's now with Peter, much to Devon's shock. Devon says she is going to go back to Buffalo to take care of their father, and the pair share a tearful goodbye when it's clear Simone is planning to stay on the island with Peter.",
      "Simone gets up and gives a toast to the gala's attendees, standing in Michaela's usual place. Devon gets on a ferry back to the mainland.",
      "On the ferry, she runs into Michaela and the pair have a heartfelt conversation about what's next for them.",
      "\"I think she\u2019s ready to get on with her life,\" Moore says of her character. \"In a sense, she\u2019s kind of back to herself. She\u2019s really back to someone who doesn\u2019t know what her future is, but she has agency, and she\u2019ll make decisions based on her own life and her own needs. So I actually think she\u2019s in a good place.\"",
      "The episode ends with a shot of Simone standing in front of Peter's home, looking out at what is now hers and thinking about all it took for her to get here \u2014 and what happened to the person who got in her way."

      "\u201cHonest to God, I thought she was great,\u201d Willie continues, adding that her chill vibe made it feel like they were just having lunch at her house. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder of what it\u2019s like to be on that side of it, about making our guests comfortable so that they open up more, reveal and feel like it\u2019s a place where they can really share.\u201d"

      "Miley Cyrus revealed the medical condition that's behind her unique voice, and why it impacts her ability to go on tour.",
      "Cyrus shared more about her Reinke's edema diagnosis in an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe on May 21.",
      "\u201cI have the Reinke\u2019s edema, which is something that is called, it\u2019s abuse of the vocal cords,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cAnd being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also in my case, it does not cause it. So my voice always sounded like this \u2014 it's a part of my unique anatomy.\u201d",
      "Reinke's edema, also known as polypoid corditis or vocal cord edema, is a voice disorder caused by the swelling of the vocal chords, and occurs when fluid builds up in the outer layer of the vocal chords, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The disorder is most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, but people with chronic acid reflux, or a history of repetitive vocal trauma, like Cyrus, can also be affected.",
      "The \"Flowers\" singer went on to add that she also has a large polyp on her vocal chord, which she says has given her \"a lot of the tone and the texture\" that has made her who she is as a performer.",
      "\"But it's extremely difficult to perform with, because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus, 32, said that sometimes when she calls her mother, Tish Cyrus, at the end of the day, her mom tells her, \"Oh, you sound like you're talking through a radio.\"",
      "\"And that's how you know I'm really tired, because it creates that ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said. \"And so I do have this blessing of a condition that I live with.\"",
      "Cyrus said that even though she has both Reinke's edema and the large polyp on her vocal chord, she doesn't have plans to remove the polyp.",
      "\"I'm not willing to sever it, because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus told Lowe she plans a tour \"like every other week,\" but that her health and other factors play into her actually going on the road to perform.",
      "\"I want to do it, but it would have to be in a way that is sustainable for me in all the ways that we talked about, and then also with what I got going on,\" she said. \"Like, I don't lip sync. I sing live, and these songs are big.\"",
      "She referred to two songs on her upcoming record, \"Something Beautiful,\" which is set to drop on May 30.",
      "\"'End of the World' is a huge song, and 'More to Lose,' it's really strenuous, it's a big song. And so I don't write little songs,\" Cyrus said. \"And even if you listen to the past albums, like 'Party in the U.S.A.,' maybe, if you're in the audience and you're singing along, it's one thing, but when you've got the mic and you're performing, it's totally different.\"",
      "Cyrus also listed the logistics of traveling with a big crew, plus transporting the stage and lights, and needing to be able to play a certain amount of shows for it to \"mathematically make sense.\"",
      "\"So really, the problem for me with touring, is not only me, because this is about connecting with people around the world and using my music as a tool to heal,\" she said. \"I've always said, medicate a sick culture through these songs that I've created, or am creating. But the truth of it is is that touring, as much of it's an experience for the audience, it's a business for everybody else.\""

      "As the conclusion to \u201cSurvivor\u201d 48 began on Wednesday, May 21, there were only five castaways remaining: Eva Erickson, Kyle Fraser, Mitch Guerra, Joe Hunter and Kamilla Karthigesu.",

      "By the end of the three-hour Season 48 finale, just three castaways lasted to the Final Tribal Council: Kyle, Eva and Joe.",
      "After the jury members' votes were cast, Probst continued the divisive recent tradition of announcing the winner then and there.",
      "Kyle Fraser won \"Survivor\" 48, Probst revealed. Read on for how it all shook out.",
      "What happened during the 'Survivor' 48 finale?",
      "Following the blindside of Shauhin Davari in the penultimate episode, the final five returned to their Niu Nai camp to discuss Tribal Council. Eva and Joe thanked Kyle for tipping them off that Shauhin had turned on them, not realizing that Kyle and Kamilla concocted a plan to trick the duo into eliminating Shauhin.",
      "Kyle pointed out in his confessional that he was in a good spot, with the option of either sticking beside his strongest ally, Kamilla, or going to the final three with Eva and Joe. But, he still had more obstacles to tackle, like winning the next immunity challenge. He also worried about how Eva planned to play her hidden immunity idol.",
      "Meanwhile, Kamilla marveled at her lying abilities, adding that she planned to own all her deceptive game play if she made it to Final Tribal Council.",
      "But first, the players had to unlock a puzzle that would give them an advantage in the next challenge. Eva secured the advantage by cracking the code.",
      "At the next immunity challenge, which also included a pasta-filled reward, Probst welcomed the final five and explained that Eva's advantage allowed her to skip one of the ball toss sections. But despite the leg up, Kamilla pulled off the victory in a \u201cmassive comeback,\u201d as the host said.",
      "After Kamilla secured her spot in the final four, the other finalists had multiple conversations to decide who would join the jury as the next castaway voted out of \u201cSurvivor\" 48. Although the obvious choice seemed to be to get rid of Joe, Kamilla and Kyle contemplated eliminating Mitch instead. They were convinced that Mitch could make a better pitch to the jury if he made it to the end of the game.",
      "So when the second-to-last Tribal Council began, Mitch was a sitting duck. Kyle directly told Probst that Mitch's name was tossed around at camp. Mitch became emotional as he said it \"sucked\" knowing his game was over. But, he said he didn't have any regrets.",
      "With Mitch getting his torch snuffed, the final four journeyed to the Niu Nai camp, again, and celebrated.",
      "The next morning, the final four watched the sunrise together. In her confessional, Eva said she would take Joe to the end despite him being a strong competitor. Kamilla had a different plan for her other half in the game. She told Kyle she would select him to make fire against Joe. Kyle agreed with her thinking. As for Joe, he wanted to go to the end with Eva.",
      "For the final immunity challenge, Probst said the final four would have to\u00a0participate in a \"Survivor\" \"classic.\" The ball challenge, called \"Simmotion,\" which has appeared in multiple past seasons, required concentration and hand-eye coordination.",
      "After a close battle with Joe, Kyle became the last \u201cSurvivor\" 48 contestant to have the immunity necklace placed around his neck. He was also tasked with choosing which castaway would automatically join him in the finale, thus confirming the other two would have to participate in the fire-making challenge.",
      "Kyle upheld a promise he made before the challenge and told Joe he was taking him to the final three, meaning Eva and Kamilla had to make fire. While prepping for the challenge, Eva became overwhelmed. Joe offered to take her spot, but she declined. So, he sat with her and shared some tips to improve her fire-making skills.",
      "Before facing off, the jury looked stunned to learn that Kyle chose Joe. Each player then sat at their respective stations and began building their fires. Eva easily pulled off the victory, cementing her spot in the final three, as Kamilla struggled to get anything going.",
      "On Day 26, the last day of the season, Kyle, Joe and Eva enjoyed their breakfast feast as viewers heard the jury \u2014 Cedrek McFadden, Chrissy Sarnowsky, David Kinne, Star Toomey, Mary Zheng, Shauhin, Mitch and Kamilla \u2014 share what they hoped to hear at Final Tribal Council.",
      "As the sun set, Eva, Kyle and Joe made their way to Probst, ready to be grilled by the eliminated cast members.",
      "Probst advised them, \"Own your game and claim your victory,\" before the questions began.",
      "Multiple secrets were spilled, including Kyle revealing his true occupation as a lawyer and his undercover partnership with Kamilla.",
      "For their final pitches, Kyle said he was the most well-rounded player because he built strong relationships and played in the middle all season long. Joe spoke about being a 45-year-old firefighter and needing the money to take care of his family. Eva said  there has never been a player like her on the show and that she \"embodied\" the season by being \"unprecedented.\"",
      "After the votes were cast, Probst revealed that Kyle won, receiving five votes. Eva had two and Joe had one, marking a rare occasion in which all three finalists received votes at Final Tribal Council.",

      "In 2019, Kim Kardashian spoke about her passion for prison reform in an interview with Vogue, citing it as the driving force behind her decision to pursue a legal education. Despite having never obtained an undergraduate degree, the 44-year-old pursued a nontraditional legal education path known as \u201creading the law,\u201d a program available in California and a number of other states. The approach allows individuals an opportunity to qualify for the bar exam under the mentorship of a licensed attorney.",
      "Khloe Kardashian posted a video capturing her sister sitting on the side of a small stage as two of her mentors spoke about her achievements. Attorney Jessica Jackson, one of the mentors who sponsored Kim Kardashian during her studies, lauded her for putting in the work to achieve her goal while also working as a mother, businesswoman and public figure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute honor to stand here today, not just as mentors, but as witnesses to one of the most inspiring legal journeys we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSix years ago, Kim Kardashian walked into this program with nothing but a fierce desire to fight for justice. No law school lectures, no ivory tower shortcuts, just determination and a mountain of case log books to read.\u201d",
      "Jackson underscored how Kim Kardashian allocated 18 hours a week, 48 weeks a year, for six straight years to study.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s time she carved out while raising four children, running businesses, filming television shows and showing up in courtrooms to advocate for others,\u201d Jackson noted.",

      "Another one of Kim Kardashian's mentors commended her in the ceremony for focusing her efforts on marginalized groups.",
      "Attorney and CNN political correspondent Van Jones was also in attendance and delivered a speech that captured the early skepticism surrounding Kim Kardashian\u2019s legal ambitions and intentions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying not to get emotional,\u201d he said before thanking Kim Kardashian for her efforts and praising her commitment to criminal justice advocacy. \u201cSix years, seven years ago, when you were working on criminal justice, you were not embraced by anybody.\u201d",
      "Jones went on to recall how she chose to work with individuals he described as having been abandoned by society, and at times, their own families.",
      "\u201cThe advocates are always last in line on the other, more popular causes,\" he explained. \"It\u2019s a lonely fight.\"",

    "summary": "Here are five best savory and sweet food items to get across the five worlds at Universal Epic Universe from the PB&amp;J Mac & Cheese Cone and DK Crush Float.",
    "story": [
      "Sure, amusement parks are for the rides, but one could argue they\u2019re really for the thematic food. And with Universal Epic Universe opening its portals on May 22, a lot of chatter is happening around new offerings that are as good as they look.",
      "From viral sensations like the PB&J Mac & Cheese Cone and DK Crush Float, to the gruesome-looking but oh-so-satisfying Crimson Glazed Pork Belly, TODAY.com got to taste a plethora of options across Epic Universe, with one option for each of the five worlds.",
      "Let\u2019s dig in, shall we?",
      "(Universal is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "1. Crimson Glazed Pork",
      "Location: Das Stakehaus, Dark Universe",
      "If you\u2019re looking for a meal that\u2019s more filling (with some down time to digest in the aftermath), order the Crimson Glazed Pork Belly. The char siu-style pork belly comes with green onion mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, maitake mushrooms and acorn squash, with the finishing touch: bloody roast pork dipping sauce.",
      "2. DK Crush Float",
      "Location: The Bubbly Barrel, Super Nintendo WorldIt's easy to go bananas over this jumbo-sized treat with banana and pineapple soft serve in a waffle cone, topped with caramel popcorn and chocolate. You can get it in a regular plastic cup or upgrade to the souvenir Donkey Kong barrel mug.",
      "3. Burning Cheddar Bites",
      "Location: Burning Blade Tavern, Dark Universe",
      "\u201cCharred\u201d on the outside, chewy on the inside. These round bites might look like they\u2019d break your teeth (or at the very least, give you a strong burnt taste), but they are surprisingly soft and slightly crispy fried jalape\u00f1o pimento cheddar bites. An order comes with Sriracha ranch on the side.",
      "4. Strawberry Yum Ice Cream",
      "Location: Frosty Moon, Celestial Park",
      "This ice cream flavor is true to its name. Strawberry ice cream is a classic treat in itself, but paired with strawberry cheesecake chunks and birthday sprinkles? A next-level sugar rush with an aesthetic to match.",
      "5. PB&J (Pork, Bacon & Jam) Mac & Cheese Cone",
      "Location: Hooligan\u2019s Grog & Gruel, How to Train Your Dragon \u2014 Isle of Berk",
      "Pulled pork and peanut bacon jam might not sound ideal to walk around with in the Florida heat, but the mild temperature of the meat and cheese paired with the garlic bread makes the PB&J a satisfying combo. Plus, the garlic bread cup makes a seemingly impractical snack an ideal grab-and-go meal."

    "summary": "Gillian Flynn opens up about her imprint and writing process in a new interview.",
    "story": [
      "When Gillian Flynn sits down to write a book, she never knows the ending.",
      "Such was the case when the New York Times bestselling author wrote her thrilling novel-turned-film \u201cGone Girl,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI see it at the beginning. I always know my beginning scene,\u201d Flynn says. \"I pictured it with \u2018Gone Girl \u2014 a man coming home to a house and the door is wide open, and that moment of feeling like, \u2018Why is the door wide open?\u2019\u201d",
      "As a self-proclaimed true crime fanatic, Flynn says her initial scenario invoked fear around, \u201cWhat would it be like to have your spouse mysteriously disappear? And everyone says, \u2018It\u2019s always the husband.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd you cannot not look guilty. Because if you\u2019re crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s putting on a show.\u2019 And if you\u2019re not crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cSo, you know, I started playing with that from there.\u201d",
      "For any book Flynn writes, be it her 2006 debut \"Sharp Objects\" or 2012's \u201cGone Girl,\u201d the plot unfolds as she gets inside her characters' heads.",
      "This means Flynn reaches the story's end nearly at the same point the reader does \u2014 but she gets to choose how the characters are remembered in their final moments on the page.",
      "For \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Flynn says the twisted ending readers now know didn\u2019t always exist. Instead, she tells TODAY.com how the book originally painted characters Amy and Nick.",
      "\u201cThere was the one (ending) I was originally going to go with \u2014 that you didn\u2019t know that Amy had framed Nick until the very end, so you didn\u2019t meet Amy at all,\u201d Flynn says, explaining that the draft's entire story was \u201call Nick\u2019s point of view as he\u2019s bouncing around, looking more and more guilty.\u201d",
      "In this end of the story, which \u201cno one read\u201d aside from Flynn, the reader would have discovered Amy framed the man they\u2019d been following for the entire novel, naturally prompting more sympathy for Nick.",
      "\u201cAnd then I started thinking, \u2018Who is this woman who did all this stuff?\u2019 I kept getting obsessed with, \u2018Who would do this?\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018I need Amy in this story. I can\u2019t hide her until then. That\u2019s no fun,\u2019\u201d Flynn says.",
      "As readers know, Amy became the focal point of the page-turner. But Flynn wrote other endings, too.",
      "\u201cI had the Ozark grifters come back into (Amy\u2019s) life at the end and frame her,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI did have one ending where she was going to go to jail and that lasted for a day, literally. I was like, \u2018She would never go to jail. Amy would never go to jail.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though Flynn is known for her twists, she says she's more interesting in making points about the human psyche and larger-scale world issues.",
      "\u201cI always say, I write character studies and themes, and I hide it all inside the chocolate of a juicy mystery, so that I can get people to read it,\u201d she says.",
      "Now, Flynn is working on screenwriting and also became a publisher herself, starting her own imprint, Gillian Flynn Books, with upcoming titles like Danie Shokoohi's \"Glass Girls.\"",
      "Flynn chatted with TODAY.com about her books, her new imprint and the advice she'd give aspiring authors.",
      "This interview has been edited.",
      "How did you decide to make the move into publishing with Gillian Flynn Books?",
      "It started with Molly Stern, who was my publisher during \u201cGone Girl,\u201d asking me if I'd be interested in an imprint.",
      "I wasn't looking to have an imprint. But I realized I could create my own mission statement and could make sure there were voices getting out there who weren't just copying whatever previous popular book was, falling into a pre-arranged shape or done only by people who already have platform.",
      "I find a really dangerous trend, that this current market is really squashing out the kind of voices that I love, which are the quirky, weird, off kilter, not easy to put inside a box.",
      "The current series that I\u2019m publishing, Margot Douaihy\u2019s series, is about a punk rock former addict nun who is totally tattooed and solves mysteries in New Orleans. Or Stacy Horn\u2019s nonfiction book, \u201cThe Killing Fields of East New York,\u201d is all about white collar crime and how it decimated a community. These are things that aren\u2019t necessarily going to get snapped up immediately. And I wanted to give that voice.",
      "Was it intentional that all the authors you've published so far have been female?",
      "It is not. It has just happened to be the ones that have come to me that I really, really love. It has not been an intentional thing, but it has been the ones so far that have really drawn me.",
      "Would you agree the audience predominantly consuming crime and thriller storylines are women? Why do you think that is?",
      "I think women are more acquainted with fear than men are. We live with it as part of our everyday. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t obsess you or control you too much, but I don\u2019t know any woman who doesn\u2019t, in the very back of her mind go, \u2018\" could walk out the door and if I walk down the wrong corner, if I stay out too late, if I get in the wrong place, something really, really bad could happen to me.\" I don\u2019t know very many women who haven\u2019t had some sort of close up moment that made them a little frightened. I mean, we all carry that with us.",
      "I think the crime genre, when it\u2019s done right, really can touch on that issue and give us a vocabulary and a means to talk about it, and give us almost a way to purge that fear a little bit \u2014 understanding that it\u2019s out there and that I\u2019m not crazy. Sometimes you have that moment of, like, \u2018\"m I crazy to be nervous in this situation? Is it me?\" And the answer is f------ better safe than sorry.",
      "Writing wise, what are you working on right now?",
      "I\u2019m working on a lot, writing wise. Most of it is screenplay stuff. Ever since I did adapted \u201cGone Girl\u201d for the screen, I\u2019ve been really attracted to screenwriting and creating film and TV. And that\u2019s largely because I grew up in a household where my mom taught reading and my dad taught film. And so, to me, they\u2019re both equally viable ways of telling a story.",
      "The one I\u2019m most excited about is adapting \u201cDark Places,\" my second book, for HBO. It's not official yet, but fingers crossed.",
      "I\u2019ve told myself that after I get these couple projects done, that I\u2019m going to shut down that part for a little bit and just finish this book I\u2019m writing. It\u2019s daunting writing a book after \u201cGone Girl.\u201d You have the demons on your shoulder going, \u201cIs this too much like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019? Is it not enough like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019?\u201d",
      "What is your initial writing process like?",
      "I write in my head all the time. I can\u2019t turn it off. I was writing something in my head on the way to work today, on the way to the office, that is not going to go anywhere. It was just something I was thinking about, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a great line. What is that? Where\u2019s that line go?\u201d It\u2019s describing a character or describing a moment or scenery.",
      "One of the walls in my office is a whiteboard. It's got whiteboard wallpaper just entirely on it, which is fantastic for a writer. But it looks like the scribblings of a mad woman because I just write different ideas for different projects. People will look at it and it really does look like a crazy person because it's all over.",
      "Do you still write down those random ideas?",
      "Yeah. I\u2019ll probably never remember where it\u2019s at or to look at it. But every once in a while I do go like, \u201cAh, I wrote that down somewhere.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cDid I write in my email? Did I write on my wall. Is it in a notebook?\u201d",
      "What does the rewriting process look like for you?",
      "I loop around and rewrite a little bit as I go. But my aim is generally to get a crappy first draft. And that's what I would tell anyone who wants to be a writer because you're never going to know what's wrong with your story until you have a really crappy first draft. And then don't be afraid of it. You can go back and see what's wrong.",
      "Then I rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite. I mean, I love rewriting. That's when I get happy. That's my happy spot. Though, writing the actual opening draft is terrifying \u2014 and it's suspenseful because you really don't know where you're going.",
      "At what point do you let people read?",
      "Not until it\u2019s done. Third or fourth draft. I want to make sure that I\u2019m writing the book I want to write. I think you give it to people early on, and they\u2019re telling you, \u201cOh, I could do this.\u201d Even if you really respect them, and it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s not what I want. It\u2019s really hard to get to a point where you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to you to tell me what I should do here.\u201d",
      "So I figure it all out. I get it in really, really good shape. And then I give it to my husband, first and foremost. He\u2019s an amazing reader and editor, basically. And then I give it to a very small circle of friends \u2014 very small, like, two.",
      "Have you ever made major changes after hearing feedback?",
      "I will admit, I give it to people and I change very little afterwards. I\u2019ll listen, though. My husband will say something like, \u201cThis scene is cool. It goes on a little long.\u201d OK, yeah.",
      "I take it back \u2014 for \u201cDark Places,\u201d he did give me some criticism. I made big changes on that one. But for the most part, it\u2019s more, \u201cThis seemed to go on too long. Make your point. Should I move along from this?\u201d That sort of thing.",
      "Do you have any advice for writers navigating the world of publishing right now?",
      "Whatever you do, don't chase what seems popular right now. It's very tempting. It may pay off, but you're still always going to be the knockoff of someone else. You're going to be the, \"If you like so and so, you'll like this person.\" And how much do you want to be that? Do you want to have your own voice? That's why you're writing. So even though the market is tighter, the great voices do get found. It may take a little longer, but it's about unique, interesting, great writing.",
      "When I did \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d we got rejected quite a bit. At that time, it was sort of strange. People always said women don\u2019t want to read about dark women, and we proved that wrong. Might take more. Might take a little longer. But it\u2019ll get there if you have a bold and unique voice. Those are the ones that usually make it through the clutter of all the imitators.",

      "\u201cI think Willie (Geist) is one of the most amazing interviewers,\u201d Sara Hamlin, a longtime fan and Chicago resident tells TODAY.com at a reception ahead of Willie\u2019s Sunday Sitdown Live with guest Ina Garten on May 19. \u201cHe\u2019s just different than any other interviewer, and Ina is one of my favorite chefs.\u201d",
      "Along with her husband Scott, Hamlin flew into New York City just to see Willie speak with his friend Garten at City Winery at Pier 57.",
      "\u201cShe made me feel like I could actually cook,\u201d Sara says of the Barefoot Contessa, adding that she regularly makes her roast chicken recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list for me to be here to see two of my favorite people. We\u2019ve never seen her in person before.\u201d",
      "And the Hamlins aren\u2019t the only far-flung fans to make the trip to the event.",

      "\u201cNails it!\u201d Simeon Pappas, her husband, chimes in. \u201cWhen she makes that, there\u2019s no chicken left at the end between the two of us, not when we have five friends over, either.\u201d",
      "Other folks in attendance from Dallas, Texas, San Diego, California and other stretches of the U.S. dressed to the nines in sparkly skirt-sets, pearl-embroidered collars, Garten-esque scarves and denim to see the woman who personifies simple comfort, at least according to Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d",
      "Fans from as far as Canada made the journey to see Willie and Garten chat and do a short cooking demo, too \u2014 a kind of dedication that our host finds thrilling.",
      "\u201cIt still blows me away,\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com backstage. \u201cThese people out there feel strongly and passionately about our show, so let\u2019s bring them into the room.\u201d",
      "Garten walked onstage to Eartha Kitt\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est Si Bon\u201d to an audience of more than 500 fans, who gave the francophile a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cLove the music,\u201d Garten said with a smile.",
      "\u201cYes, right? Little French music for Ina,\u201d Willie replied, to laughter from everyone in the room.",
      "During their sitdown, Garten spoke with Willie about her memoir \u201cBe Ready When the Luck Happens,\u201d dinner party no-nos, her relationship with husband Jeffrey and her Food Network show \u201cBe My Guest,\u201d which has welcomed such names as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jennifer Garner and Stanley Tucci.",
      "\u201cThe list of people who sort of make the pilgrimage to your barn is amazing,\u201d Willie said, before asking if she had a dream guest. The crowd listened in rapt attention \u2014 and Garten didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d she said to cheers and applause.",
      "Garten and Swift have become close over the years, sharing mutual admiration. The cookbook author has previously shared that she first met the 14-time Grammy winner at TODAY. Later, their budding friendship was cemented when Food Network Magazine asked musicians who their favorite Food Network cooks were.",
      "\u201cTaylor chose me, which was so sweet,\u201d Garten said.",
      "Garten added that Swift has been to the barn \u2014 the Contessa\u2019s nickname for her East Hampton home \u2014 about 10 years ago, and they spent time in her kitchen.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna just stand there and take pictures of her,\u201d Garten said with a chuckle. \u201cI wanted to cook with her.\u201d",

      "\u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like Taylor Swift, that sounds like a Ukrainian grandmother,\u2019\u201d Garten said to laughter. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re not gonna make any of those things.\u2019\u201d",

      "Rob McElhenney says he\u2019s considering switching to a shorter last name.",
      "The \"It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" star \u2014 who also co-owns the Wrexham A.F.C football team with Ryan Reynolds \u2014\u00a0 told Variety he wants to swap his notoriously challenging surname for one that's easier to pronounce.",
      "The decision, he said, coincides with his multimedia company, More Better Industries, increasing its global investments, which now includes soccer teams in Colombia and Mexico.",
      "\"As our business and our storytelling is expanding into other regions of the world and other languages in which my name is even harder to pronounce, I\u2019m just going by Rob Mac,\u201d he said.",
      "The actor told the publication he initially worried that a name change might be considered disrespectful to his Irish ancestry. That is, until he discovered others in his family had changed the name over the years.",
      "Last month, family members who celebrated his birthday with McElhenney confided they, too, were interested in a name change.",
      "Olson, who tied the knot with McElhenney in 2008, told Variety she and the couple's sons \u2014 Axel Lee, 14, and Leo Grey, 13 \u2014\u00a0weren't sure what to make of the idea.",
      "\u201cThe kids are really not happy about it, because they have that last name ... And so do I, legally!\" she said.",
      "\"Mac\" wouldn\u2019t be all that hard for fans and people in McElhenney\u2019s orb to remember. After all, he plays a pub co-owner named Mac on \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny\u201d and also co-owns a bar in Philadelphia, Mac\u2019s Tavern, in real life with wife and \"Sunny\" co-star Kaitlin Olson.",
      "McElhenney\u2019s name-swap idea comes more than two years after his prankster pal Reynolds created a music video for the actor\u2019s birthday to teach fans how to say his last name.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Mackle-Henney, it\u2019s Mackle-Henney,\u201d Reynolds sings along with a roster of guest stars, including Olson and then-Philadelphia Eagle center Jason Kelce.",
      "In 2023, Olson, who also stars on the new hit ABC drama \"High Potential\"\u00a0and has a recurring role on the HBO hit comedy \"Hacks,\" poked fun at rumors that McElhenney had been cheating on her while in Wales.",
      "\"It was me who had the affair. But it was not someone from Wales. It was with a whale,\u201d Olson tweeted at the time.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved whales,\" she added. \"They\u2019re the bosses of the ocean and I\u2019m attracted to power. We ask for privacy as we navigate this difficult time.\u201d",
      "McElhenney couldn't resist reposting Olson\u2019s tweet and adding his own joke. \u201cSad to admit that rumor is true,\" he wrote."

      "\"I spent the January fires in Los Angeles arguing with my mom in a hotel room,\" the Yale University freshman wrote in the opening lines of an academic paper published in the Global Health Review.",
      "The essay itself is dense and sophisticated, exploring parallels between public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and strategies for confronting climate change. But tucked inside all that research is something more personal: a peek into the thoughts of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's eldest child.",
      "According to Violet, Garner was \u201cshell-shocked, astonished, at the scale of destruction\u201d wrought by the wildfires in the neighborhood where she is raising her family. Garner, 53, and Affleck, who divorced in 2018, are also parents to Fin, 16, and Samuel, 13.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at her surprise: as a lifelong Angelena and climate-literate member of generation Z, my question had not been whether the Palisades would burn but when,\u201d Violet wrote.",
      "The January, 2025 fires in the Los Angeles area killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes.",
      "Violet, a rising sophomore at Yale, recounted growing increasingly frustrated with other adults who dismissed the crisis as if it were merely a \u201cburst of bad luck.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Germany has this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",
      "The historic unit dispatched to the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, was inaugurated Thursday by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said during a military ceremony in the city that \u201cthe security of our Baltic allies is also our security.\u201d",
      "The groundbreaking German military decision is perhaps the most significant in a steady stream of moves by European nations to bolster defenses on NATO\u2019s eastern flank amid persistent security threats from Russia and President Donald Trump's insistence that Europe does more both to defend itself and pay for that defense.",
      "It also comes despite persistent efforts by the Trump administration to bring to an end the Kremlin's three-year-long war in Ukraine.",
      "Among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, the three Baltic nations of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia \u2014 linked to NATO\u2019s main territory only by a narrow corridor that stretches between Russia and its staunch ally Belarus known as the Suwalki Gap \u2014 are perhaps the most vulnerable to an expanded Russian assault.",
      "On Thursday, Merz said that \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive revisionism\u201d since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 meant it could seek to redraw the broader map of Europe and not just that of Ukraine.",
      "Standing alongside Merz, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da added that Russia and Belarus had already begun conducting military exercises on his country\u2019s border.",
      "The new German brigade on NATO\u2019s eastern flank will comprise a heavy combat unit of some 4,800 soldiers, hundreds of civilian staff, and 2,000 vehicles, including tanks. It will be headquartered in Rudninkai near Vilnius and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2027.",
      "\u201cAnyone who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will jointly defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d Merz said.",
      "Trump has been putting pressure on America's NATO allies to increase their military spending, previously accusing Germany and other European countries of \u201cfreeloading\u201d at Washington\u2019s expense and even going as far as implementing a temporary pause on military aid to Ukraine in March this year.",
      "It also marks a shift away from America's guarantee of European security against Russia that has been in place since World War II which has yielded U.S. hard and soft power throughout the continent and beyond.",
      "After his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election in February, Merz said his \u201cabsolute priority\u201d was \u201cstrengthening Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.\u201d",
      "In line with Germany, other European front-line countries have begun upping spending in order to fortify their borders against Russia and Belarus. Earlier this month, Lithuania announced it would spend around $1.2 billion on its military, raising it to 6% of its annual gross domestic product.",
      "Neighboring Poland, meanwhile, recently allocated an additional $2.6 billion to the sector, raising it to 4.7% of its GDP this year.",
      "Despite American diplomats holding several rounds of bilateral negotiations with diplomats from Russia and Ukraine \u2014 Trump held an as-yet-fruitless phone conversation Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 the U.S. president has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "Meanwhile, Putin said in a video conference with Russian government officials Thursday that his military had begun creating a \u201csecurity buffer zone\u201d along its border with Ukraine, a day after he visited the western Russian region of Kursk that Russia says its forces reclaimed from Ukraine earlier this month.",
      "Putin's latest move comes after Russian negotiators reportedly threatened during direct negotiations last week to seize the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Sumy if Ukraine did not agree to the Kremlin\u2019s demands that essentially amount to a surrender from Kyiv.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, this week described the threat as a warning sign from Russia in a report.",
      "\u201cThis tactic suggests that Russia will make additional, more extreme territorial demands during war termination talks should Ukraine agree to Russia\u2019s ceasefire preconditions,\u201d it stated."

      "Nine men and one woman are accused of planning and carrying out the armed robbery during Paris Fashion Week in 2016. Years of French bureaucracy delayed the trial by almost a decade, despite the defendants being arrested just months later after police found DNA at the scene.",
      "The three judges and six jurors have now retired and could give their verdict as soon as Friday evening (Paris is six hours ahead of ET). The panel will need to reach a majority decision.",
      "Presiding Judge David de Pas has summoned all parties back to the court for 7 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET), although he said this would not necessarily be the time of the verdict.",
      "Most of the defendants are in their 60s and 70s, arriving at court wearing orthopedic shoes and wielding canes. Some have illnesses that include cancer and Parkinson's disease and could not have contrasted more with Kardashian, 44, the billionaire influencer and business doyenne whose testimony marked a moment of high drama.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she told the court last week. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home,\u201d she recalled thinking.",
      "That was in the early hours of Oct. 3, 2016, when two of the men allegedly broke into her high-end private apartment, binding her ankles while she wore just a bathrobe. With one pointing a gun at her, they stole $9 million of her jewelry, including a 20-carat diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, Kanye West, now known as Ye, prosecutors said.",
      "They escaped on bike and on foot, prosecutors say, only to be arrested months later. Aside from a large cross dropped during the escape, none of the jewels have been recovered.",
      "Eight of the defendants proclaim their innocence. Two have admitted they played some role, though they say this has been overstated by the prosecution. One of them, Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote a book about it entitled \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\u201d",
      "In a final statement to the court Friday, Abbas said, \u201cI have nothing but regrets to offer you and will take my responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the mastermind was Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, an alleged veteran of the Paris underworld known as \u201cOld Omar.\u201d He admitted he was involved but claims he was only a foot soldier. He says the real leader was someone called \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 who prosecutors assert does not exist.",
      "Prosecutors want 10 years\u2019 jail time for Khedache and Abbas, as well as co-defendants Didier Dubreucq and Marc-Alexander Boyer. They have asked for: an eight-year term to be given to Khedache\u2019s son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy Ait Khedache; seven years for alleged informants Fleurus Heroui and Gary Madar; and six years for Khedache\u2019s girlfriend and suspected accomplice Christiane Glotin.",
      "Khedache, who is deaf and mute and has a condition requiring him to go to the bathroom every hour, was among the defendants to give a note of apology to Kardashian while she took the stand.",
      "\u201cThe past cannot be undone, but I hope that this letter will enable you to gradually forget the trauma you have experienced through my fault,\u201d the letter said.",
      "She responded, \u201cI forgive you for what had taken place but it doesn\u2019t change the emotions, the feeling and the trauma and the fact that my life has forever changed.\u201d",
      "However one of the defense lawyers, Henri de Beauregard, warned during the trial not to be taken in by this image of \u201ckind old men\u201d or the \u201cmyth of friendly, Robin Hood-style pensioners.\u201d",

      "Aid workers struggling to distribute a trickle of aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip are describing a logistical \u201cnightmare\u201d in the midst of a spiraling humanitarian crisis.",
      "\u201cWith this limited amount of aid, the humanitarian situation continues to get worse and worse,\u201d Dr. Amjad Alshawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group of Palestinian organizations, told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the Israelis are imposing restrictions on access to these supplies.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said humanitarian workers were able to pick up at least 90 truckloads of aid Wednesday night \u2014 but it was unclear whether that aid had been distributed as of Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground described widespread frustration among Palestinians waiting to see whether more aid will flow into the enclave. Many charities have stopped or reduced their food offerings because of the scarcity of supplies and high cost of the rare goods available at markets.",
      "After lifting its almost three-month-long blockade of the entry of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza, Israel has allowed a trickle of supplies into the enclave in recent days amid mounting international pressure. Aid groups say it has also imposed a new set of rules on bringing in supplies, which they blame for logistical snarl-ups and a delay in food and medicine reaching those who need it.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said Thursday that 198 trucks had entered Gaza, but did not specifically comment on the new procedures and referred NBC News to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for further comment, which it did not immediately provide.",
      "COGAT data suggested the majority of that aid has been food, with medicine and medical equipment making up a smaller share.",
      "Humanitarian groups have warned that the limited aid flowing in is a fraction of the amount needed, with an average of around 500 trucks a day entering in Gaza before the war, according to the British Red Cross.",
      "Despite that resumption, little if any aid entering Gaza had reached Palestinian civilians as of late Wednesday, with humanitarian groups saying that new procedures introduced by Israel have complicated an already tangled effort.",
      "Logistical 'nightmare'",
      "In a briefing Wednesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that in one instance, the rules meant that, \u201cIsraeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place, given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "While Israeli authorities have not specifically laid out what the new rules involve, Dujarric said Tuesday that humanitarian workers were being required to offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and then reload them separately once teams inside Gaza were allowed to collect them.",
      "He noted that one team waited \"several hours\" for such a green light but was never able to transport the goods.",
      "Meanwhile, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, has found many of its trucks \u201cblocked for reasons that are sometimes unknown,\u201d its head of mission for the Palestinian Territories, Jean Guy Vataux, told NBC News in Jerusalem late Wednesday.",
      "While he added that some of the new procedures were \u201cput in place to avoid smuggling,\u201d the new system \u201cturns into a logistic nightmare for the agencies.\u201d",
      "'Malnutrition is growing'",
      "Meanwhile, \"malnutrition is growing\" in Gaza, Vataux said.",
      "An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report released earlier this month warned of the risk of famine if adequate access to food was not restored.",
      "The IPC snapshot warned that some 470,000 people in Gaza were facing \u201ccatastrophic hunger,\u201d while the entire population was experiencing food insecurity, the World Food Programme said. It further projected that an \u201calarming 71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers\u201d would need \u201curgent treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. clarified comments from its humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who had said some 14,000 babies were at risk of death within a short time frame. The body said that the same number of babies is facing severe malnutrition absent a significant and swift increase of aid into Gaza, with severe malnutrition posing the risk of death."

      "One week after that life-changing phone call, NBC News spoke to Yael Alexander and her husband, Adi Alexander, about their son\u2019s more than a year in captivity and his eventual release.",
      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",
      "\u201cThe conditions in those tents are not easy. They couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Adi said, noting that Edan\u2019s time in the tent was his \u201ctoughest period\u201d in captivity.",
      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",

A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated.

    "story": [
      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

    "summary": "Taiwan's youth are stuck. There's growing concern in Taipei over the reliability of the Trump-led U.S. as a security partner, even despite Chinese aggression.",
    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world.

      "Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner swap Friday that was agreed at their first direct talks in more than three years, both countries said.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 390 Ukrainians had been returned on Friday.  Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, announced that 270 soldiers and 120 civilians had been sent home.",
      "Both sides said the swaps would continue in the coming days.",
      "Russia and Ukraine each agreed at two hours of talks in Istanbul last week to exchange 1,000 prisoners, but failed to agree to a ceasefire proposed by President Donald Trump. Previous prisoner swaps have been mediated by the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Earlier on Friday, Trump said the prisoner exchange had already been completed.",
      "The prisoner swap was the only concrete step towards peace the two sides agreed at their talks in Istanbul.",
      "\"Congratulations to both sides on this negotiation. This could lead to something big???,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been wounded or killed in Europe's deadliest war since World War II, although neither side publishes accurate casualty figures. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians have also died as Russian forces have besieged and bombarded Ukrainian cities.",
      "Ukraine says it is ready for a 30-day ceasefire immediately, but Russia, which launched the war by invading its neighbor in 2022 and now occupies about a fifth of Ukraine, says it will not pause its assaults until conditions are met first. A member of the Ukrainian delegation called those conditions \"non-starters\".",
      "Trump, who has shifted U.S. policy from supporting Ukraine towards accepting some of Russia's account of the war, had said he could tighten sanctions on Russia if Moscow blocked a peace deal. But after speaking to Putin on Monday he decided to take no action for now.",
      "Moscow says it is ready for peace talks while the fighting goes on, and wants to discuss what it calls the war's \"root causes,\" including its demands Ukraine cede more territory, and be disarmed and barred from military alliances with the West.",
      "Kyiv says that is tantamount to surrender and would leave it defenseless in the face of future Russian attacks."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened imports from the European Union with a sweeping 50% tariff, posting online that trade talks with the bloc are \"going nowhere.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that he was \"recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\" That rate would be higher than the 39% Trump promised to hit the bloc with on April 2's so-called Liberation Day.",
      "Just minutes earlier, Trump had also threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if it does not start producing iPhones in the United States \u2014 an outcome industry experts broadly see as a nonstarter. \"The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale,\" prominent tech analyst Dan Ives said in response to Trump's threat Friday.",
      "The early morning posts risked reigniting the trade war Trump started in April that had cooled down in recent weeks. His administration had been speaking positively about ongoing trade talks, even though it has so far secured few concrete economic wins. The president has backed down from some of his most severe tariffs, sparking a comeback for U.S. and global markets.",
      "That rebound looked poised to reverse after Trump\u2019s posts, with stock indexes in Germany, France and Italy each dropping nearly 3%. The Stoxx 600, which tracks hundreds of stocks across Europe, plunged more than 2%. Shares in the United Kingdom dropped more than 1%, even though it is not a member of the E.U.",
      "U.S. stocks opened sharply lower, but as of 11 a.m. ET they were off their worst levels, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% and Nasdaq Composite down 1%. The Dow was lower by 280 points or 0.7%.",
      "A number of companies with major U.S. and E.U. operations also saw their shares fall. Deutsche Bank shares plunged 4%, carmakers BMW and Stellantis, the maker of Jeep trucks, dropped 3.5%, and tech giant SAP fell 2%. Cosmetics firm L'Oreal also dropped more than 2%, and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH dropped 3%.",
      "Trump has repeatedly assailed the European Union, calling it \u201cin many ways, nastier than China.\" On tariff rates and what the U.S. calls \"non-tariff barriers,\" Trump has said, \"They'll come down a lot. You watch.\" But the bloc has refused to alter its value-added tax, a frequent point of contention for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other U.S. officials.",
      "Speaking on CNBC shortly after Trump's social media posts, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted, \"10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.\"",
      "Goolsbee added that it would be \"really scary for the supply chain\" if businesses in his Midwest district, which includes auto hub Detroit, would see tariff rates as high as 50%.",
      "The E.U. bloc is America's second-biggest trading partner behind China. The United States exported more than $350 billion of goods to the 27-nation bloc in recent years and imported $550 billion worth of goods.",
      "Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Commission's trade chief, is set to speak by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Friday morning, just hours after Trump's post.",
      "The E.U. has been bracing itself for months for the possibility that trade talks with the U.S. would fail. In early May, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the bloc preferred negotiations, \"but not at any cost. We therefore continue to prepare for every scenario.\" The following day, the E.U. announced more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"With the exception of the E.U., most [countries] are negotiating in very good faith,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday morning on Fox News. \"I would hope that this would light a fire under the E.U.\"",
      "In 2024, pharmaceutical products were the E.U.'s top export to the U.S., with more than $90 billion crossing the Atlantic, followed by more than $45 billion of vehicles and automotive products. The U.S. also imported more than $300 billion of E.U. services. Telecom, information technology and scientific services were the top imports."

      "Most experts agree this is a false, baseless claim, seized upon by Trump since employing as an adviser the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who was in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sight \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Trump commentated while the footage played.",
      "Unlike other leaders, Ramaphosa \u2014 a former trade union leader and ally of Nelson Mandela who helped end apartheid \u2014 was clearly prepared. He spoke calmly and without interruption, politely but firmly disagreeing with Trump.",
      "\u201cIt will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends,\u201d he said, when asked what would convince the American leader he was mistaken.",
      "And there was a flourish of his own.",
      "Ramaphosa had brought with him Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, two white South African golfers who are both in the Hall of Fame and have won six U.S. Open titles between them.",
      "At a meeting alongside the golf-fanatic Trump, the intention behind the maneuver was unmistakable.",
      "\u201cIf there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here,\u201d the South African leader said in the Oval Office, pointing to the white members of his entourage that also included John Steenhuisen, his agriculture minister. \u201cIt will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective.\u201d",
      "Whereas the Zelenskyy fiasco caught \u201ceveryone off guard with its intensity and its destructiveness,\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cplanned attack\u201d on Ramaphosa \u201ctook the stakes up a level,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at Ireland\u2019s University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cRamaphosa seemed to have been very well briefed and he kept his cool,\u201d he said. \u201cLeaders around the world now have a playbook for how they deal with Trump.\u201d",
      "This is not to say other leaders have not had similar successes already.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer unfurled from his breast pocket a letter from King Charles III when he came to town in February \u2014 a gambit mocked back in Britain for being sycophantic, but one that seemed to go down well with Trump.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba huddled with advisers for more than 20 hours of preparatory meetings ahead of his showdown the same month, a person familiar with the planning said. That too seemed to pay off: Ishiba arrived armed with charts clearly and colorfully illustrating Japan\u2019s investments in America and the kind of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Like Starmer, he played to Trump\u2019s appetite for a theatrical gift, bringing with him a golden samurai helmet, which in Japan often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have mastered the art of keeping a rapport with Trump while maintaining a macho-style resistance to some of his statements. During his own February Oval Office sit-down, he put his hand on Trump\u2019s arm and gently corrected his mistaken statement that European countries had merely \u201cloaned\u201d money to Ukraine.",
      "Even more stern, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney kept a straight back, clenched jaw and \u2014 though often struggling to get a word in edgewise \u2014 made it clear through words and firm hand gestures that \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d",
      "Even against this field, Ramaphosa\u2019s poise has been widely praised.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing preparing to be ambushed and another being able to manage the situation,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "\u201cMost people seem to think that Ramaphosa came out of it well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat may also be because he has good people skills, which meant that he was better placed than some world leaders to defuse the situation.\u201d",
      "However artful a sparring partner Ramaphosa was, it's still unclear how effective his tactics will be.",
      "\u201cYou wanted to see drama and something really big happening,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters afterward, downplaying the episode. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we disappointed you somewhat when it comes to that.\u201d",
      "But it was still a bruising and concerning encounter for a country that dearly needs American financial help.",
      "Hours before the Oval Office meeting, South African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said his government did not have the necessary funds to cover a $430 million shortfall caused by Trump\u2019s cuts to foreign aid.",
      "In Trump, the country faces a president who sees a \u201cperfect trifecta\u201d in the white farmer genocide claim, Patrick Gaspard, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa, told MSNBC later Wednesday.",
      "It allows Trump \u201cto play to a domestic political audience that is obsessed with white, existential threats,\u201d while distracting from domestic economic issues and promoting Musk\u2019s attempts to get a South African license for Starlink, Gaspard said.",
      "He called the encounter not only \u201cdeeply offensive and hurtful to a partnership that we have with a really important nation in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d but also said it \u201cdoes a major disservice to that Oval Office, that sacred space.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment about these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that Trump \u201cwanted to bring awareness to the horrific persecution experienced by Afrikaners.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201c15 foreign leaders have visited the White House this term because this president has restored America\u2019s reputation on the world stage, and his leadership is delivering great deals for the American people.\u201d"
